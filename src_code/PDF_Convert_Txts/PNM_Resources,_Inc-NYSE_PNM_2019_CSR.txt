 Intro duction  
At PNM  Resources, we are committed  to a carbon -free energy future and strengthening the communities  we 
serve . Our employees  live, work  and raise  their  families  in these communities  and we are proud  to support our 
customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders through our focus on environmental, social and 
governance  principles . 
As part of our commitment to environmental, social and governance  reporting and transparency we plan to 
issue a sustainability report annually along with furnishing data on our dedicated webpage www.pnmresources.com/ESG -commitment
. These disclosures expand on and replace our previous disclosures, 
which are  available in the previous year reporting section of the ESG Commitment website.  
We serve  electricity  to approximately  790,000 homes  and businesses  in New Mexico  and Texas  through  our 
regulated  utilities,  PNM  and TNMP.  PNM  currently  has a generation  portfolio  producing 2,811 megawatts.  PNM  
Resources  has committed  to achieving carbon -free power generation by 2040 – aligning to surpass  the goals of 
the Paris Climate Agreement . 
In 2019, PNM set the earliest goal of any U.S. investor‐owned utility to achieve a 100% emissions ‐free 
generation portfolio by 2040 . 
Environment  
PNM Resources is committed to the responsible use and protection of our natural resources. We have a long -
stand
ing record of environmental stewardship. The focus of our efforts to provide environmentally responsible 
power centers on four key areas:  
cont
inuing to develop strategies to provide reliable and affordable power; 
transfo
rming the PNM generation portfolio to 100% emissions -free res
ources by 2040;  
preparin
g PNM's system to meet New Mexico's increasing renewable energy resource  standard s as cost -
effect
ively as possible; and  
increas
ing energy efficiency participation.  
Emissions -Free by 2040  
At PNM Resources, we are taking action to protect our environment and conserve our natural resources while building a clean, secure and sustainable energy future. We have a long history of environmental stewardship, 
balanced with cost conscientiousness. We advance the use of cleaner sources of energy and promote 
responsible conservation measures, including energy efficiency. We have made, and continue to make, 
6 
 significant investments to reduce the environmental impact of delivering power while minimizing the cost to our 
customers.  
Plan to exit all coal generation by the end of 2031  
Eliminate emissions from natural gas generation and actively pursue the development of carbon -
free replacement power alternatives  
Attai n
 our goal for our electricity generation to be 100% emissions -free b
y 2040, five  years ahead 
of the New Mexico state carbon -free mandate.   
 
The En
ergy Transition Act (ETA) , passed in the 2019 New Mexico legislative session , introduces a mandate 
of 100% carbon -free e
nergy by 2045  and sets an aggressive new Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) , 
requiring investor -owned utilities to achieve  40% renewable energy by 2025, 50% by 2030, and 80% by 
2040, w hile also protecting customers and workers in the transition to clean energy. Going forward, our 
resource planning will achieve dramatic reductions in carbon emissions and lead us to a clean portfolio of 
electricity generation . To further support the transition to carbon -free e
lectric  generation in New Mexico, 
the ETA also allows for securitization financing through energy transition bonds for the undepreciated investment, reclamation and decommissioning costs for qualifying coal- fired generation facilities, along 
with amounts for seve rance, job training and economic development for impacted regions.  
The
 nameplate capacity for each resource in PNM ‘s generation portfolio as of  December 31, 2019  is shown in 
the following table , including resources that are owned, leased or contracted under purchase power 
agreements . In addition, PNM 
purchases power from a customer -owned distributed 
solar generation program that had an installed capacity of 138.6 MW at June  30, 2020.   
PNM has significantly reduce d 
emissi ons over the past 15 
years through investments in 
pollution control technologies, the increased use of renewable 
energy  and natural gas, along 
with  the development of 
extensive energy efficiency 
programs for customers.  
As a result of  these actions, PNM’s t otal 2019 system -wide carbon dioxide emissions (which constitute the 
majority of greenhouse gas emissions) were approximately 19 % lower than 2005 levels. To date, PNM has 
reduced its coal capacity to 762 MW, a reduction of 22% from 2005 levels.  
PNM will exit SJGS in mid -2022 , which will reduc e our coal capacity by 80% from 2005 levels to only 200 MW . 
PNM also  plans to exit  the Four Corners Power Plant ( Four Corners ), and thus be coal- free, no later than  2031  
7 
 (subject to regulatory approval)  and is exploring options to exit this plant sooner . PNM plans to replac e these 
coal assets with cleaner energy  as we move toward our goal of 100% carbon -free by 2040, allowing us to realize 
significant future decreases in our carbon dioxide emissions and increase the amount of renewables in our 
portfolio to meet New Mexico’s increased RPS .  
In addition to the ETA, c urrent applicable law s and regulations  are in place to regulate carbon dioxide emissions 
from existing fossil- fueled power plants , includ ing the federal Affordable Clean Energy rule.  
In June 2019, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA) issued the final version of the Affordable Clean 
Energy rule to replace the Clean Power Plan, which would have regulated carbon dioxide emissions by requiring 
power generators to change their energy portfolios (shifting generation from coal to gas, and from fossil fuels to renewable energy). The Affordable Clean Energy rule became effective in September 2019. The rule sets the Best System of Emission Reducti on (BSER) for existing coal- fired power plants as heat rate efficiency 
improvements based on a range of “candidate technologies” that can be applied inside the fence -line. Rather 
than setting a specific numerical standard of performance, the rule allows  states to determine which of the 
candidate technologies to apply to each coal- fired unit and establish standards of performance based on the 
degree of emissions reduction achievable with the application of the BSER. Each state is required to submit a plan wi thin three years of the effective date of the rule to EPA for power plants in its jurisdiction. It could take 
up to six years for a site -specific plan to be issued to an applicable plant and this does not include the additional 
time granted to covered faci lities to demonstrate compliance with the rule. Ultimately, the rule is not expected 
to have a significant impact on  PNM , as the company  plans to exit SJGS before New Mexico’s state plan is due.  
Since the Navajo Nation does not have primacy over its air qu ality program, EPA would be the regulatory 
authority responsible for implementing the Affordable Clean Energy rule at Four Corners. It is unclear how and when EPA will implement these regulations and how much time the plant will have to comply. PNM plans t o exit 
the Four Corners Power Plant by 2031.  
Regardless of future regulation or legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil- fueled 
power plants, PNM has made major strides in reducing its emissions, and expects to continue with its plans to transform its generation portfolio to be carbon -free by 2040.  
Resource Planning  
As PNM continues its transition to an emission s-free energy future, its resource planning process will continue 
to be a key component for ensuring that the company  deploys an appropriate mix of resources at the right time 
to ensure safe and r eliab le service at an affordable cost for its customers. PNM conducts research and planning 
activities using a number of different avenues , including preparing an Integrated Res ource Plan (IRP) once every 
three years. The IRP identifies portfolios of resources to supply PNM customers' energy needs over a 20 -year 
period , with a specific action plan for the next four years. The IRP is a public process that includes numerous 
stakeho lder meetings and public input to generate the plan. The IRP results in a resource planning roadmap for 
PNM and documents the actions required to achieve the plan's objectives over the next four years.  
PNM was slated to file its next IRP by July 2020.  In recognition of the pending decision continuing consideration 
of replacement power for SJGS, the filing deadline was extended to early 2021. Our most recently completed  IRP, filed in 2017, is available at www.pnm.com/irp.
 This IRP supported key changes to achieve the 
most cost -effective portfolio  for customers , including:  8 
 • Retir ing SJGS coal -fired Units 1 and 4 in 2022 (497 MW retail + 65 MW merchant) after the existing coal-
supply agreement expires on June 30, 2022 (Units 2 and 3 were retired at the end of 2017),  
• Exiting the 13% participation (200 MW) in Four Corners when the existing coal- supply agreement expires 
in 2031,  and 
• Acquir ing replacement power consisting of renewables, natural gas, and potentially energy storage . 
In addition to the cost benefit to customers, these changes result in further significant reductions in carbon 
dioxide emissions and more clean energy options for customers.  Following this IRP, PNM  filed an application 
with the NMPRC requesting approval to exit SJGS in 2022  on July 1, 2019  and proposed several scenarios for 
replacement resources. On July 29, 2020 the NMPRC approved a portfolio of replacement resources that 
includes 650 MW of solar resources and 300 MW of battery storage resources , along wit h additional demand 
side measures . 
Outside of the SJGS filing, the NMPRC approved  140 MW of new wind resources as part of PNM’s 2020 
renewable plan , as well as 50 MW of solar under a voluntary program  designed to support governmental, tribal 
and large customers known as PNM Solar Direct . These new resources will both be added in 2021.  
PNM has opted to return 114 MW of leased capacity in Palo Verde  market conditions when the leases expire in 
January 2023 and January  2024, based on its ongoing analysis of 2020 market conditions and potential 
replacement options for the capacity . We have issued an RFP for replacement resources for this capacity that 
will allow for the integration of more renewable and othe r flexible resources that better align with intermittent 
customer usage.  
Each of these opportunities furthers our plans to significantly reduce carbon dioxide  emissions and achieve our 
goal to deliver 100% emissions- free electricity to serve its customers  by 2040. These developments, together 
with PNM’s significant investment in low - and no -carbon resources, also will help position the company to 
effectively respond to future climate change regulations. The results of the 2017 IR P and subsequent resource 
modeling have  illustrate d that energy needs are changing and  replacing coal- fired generation with renewable 
energy and more flexible generators will save money for customers in the long run. The most cost -effective 
portfolios identified in PNM’s I RPs are not a final determination of PNM’s future generation portfolio. For 
example, exiting  coal assets and adding new replacement resources to serve customers require prior NMPRC 
approval. PNM obtained approval in April 2020 to exit SJGS  and the NMPRC ap proved the replacement resource 
portfolio for SJGS on July 29, 2020 .  Likewise,  exiting Four Corners by  2031 w ill require prior NMPRC  approval.  
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station  
PNM is proud to be a participant in Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station  (Palo Verde) , the largest nuclear 
power plant in the U.S., located near Phoenix, Arizona. Palo Verde is licensed and routinely inspected by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  (NRC). It is a three -unit, 3,810 MW generating station operated by Arizona 
Public Service Company that provides energy to more than one million homes in the Southwest. PNM owns 288 
MW and leases an additional 114 MW of the total capacity, which  provided about 33 % of the energy  needs of 
PNM’s customers in 2018 and 2019 .  
Palo Verde emits zero carbon dioxide in the generation process. The plant generates spent nuclear fuel that is 
stored in an onsite fuel pool until it can be transferred to dry storage casks inside an NRC licensed, on -site 
storage facility. This facility ma y be expanded to include all required casks for nuclear fuel used through Palo 
Verde's NRC Operating License duration of 2047.  9 
 Palo Verde is the only nuclear energy facility in the world that uses treated sewage effluent for cooling water. 
The sewage efflu ent water is produced from the metropolitan Phoenix area. The wastewater is treated again at 
the plant's water reclamation facility and then stored in an 80 -acre reservoir for use in the plant's nine cooling 
towers. More than 20 billion gallons of water are recycled each year.  
On June 11, 2020, PNM announced that it will return the 114 MW of leased assets under both its Palo Verde 
Unit 1 and Unit 2 leases upon expiration of the leases in January 2023 (104 MW) and 2024  (10 MW) , which 
would allow PNM to integ rate more renewable resources that provide the best value to customers and support 
the path to emissions -free energy by 2040. PNM issued an RFP for replacement power resources on June 25, 
2020.   
Wired for the Future Transmission and Distribution Investment  
To aid in the company’s robust transition to a clean and bright energy future, PNM  is focused on transmission 
and distribution infrastructure investments under  the Wired for the Future initiative . Approximately $450 
million of investment s are planned for 2021 through 2025 with the objectives of delivering clean energy, 
enhancing customer satisfaction and improving grid resilience. As the technology and price curves advance for renewables, battery storage and other emerging emissions -free resources, utility  infrastructure must be able to 
integrate and deliver these resources to customers . Investments in grid resilience provide the foundation for a 
system that can respond and adapt to integrat ing evolving technology in order to  provide long- term customer 
value. 
Climate Change Report  
Real Change | Real Results  
We recognize that climate change is a vital issue that demands bold action . We hear the voices of our 
stakeholders, from investors and businesses to our customers , employees  and community partners  who are 
conscientious about reducing their own impact on the environment and are concerned about the greenhouse gas emissions associated with generating electricity. We agree, and at PNM Resources we are taking action to 
protect our environment and conser ve our natural resources while building a clean, secure and sustainable 
energy future.  
PNM Resources has a long history of environmental stewardship, balanced with cost conscientiousness. We 
advance the use of cleaner sources of energy as well as promote r esponsible conservation measures, including 
energy efficiency. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to reduce the environmental impact of delivering power while minimizing the cost to our customers.  
PNM, our New Mexico utility, previ ously announced its plan  to completely exit coal generation by 2031 and has 
already significantly reduced overall power plant emissions:  
• In 2019, after the shutdown of Units 2 and 3 at SJGS , we reduced CO 2 emissions at this plant by 55% 
below 2005 levels (CO 2 comprises the vast majority of PNM  greenhouse gas emissions) and  
• As of December 31, 2019, 37% of PNM generating capacity is carbon  and emissions -free, including 
resources owned, leased and under purchase power agreements . 10 
 The Energy Transition Act, passed in the 2019 New Mexico legislative session, demonstrates the state’s 
commitment to further integration of cleaner energy sources. The new law sets more aggressive renewable standards and introdu ces a mandate of 100% carbon -free energy by 2045, while also protecting customers and 
workers in the transition to clean energy. Energy Transition Bonds are permitted to securitize the unrecovered 
costs on qualifying coal- fired generation facilities, reduc ing the cost to customers to retire these facilities earlier 
and allowing the utility to reinvest in cleaner energy resources.  The table below presents the net book value for 
each of PNM’s owned generation facilities:  
Notes:  
The New Mexico Energy Transition Act allows for the recovery of undepreciated investments, decommissioning 
and reclamation costs related to the retirement of PNM’s coal assets.  The Energy Transition Act also 
contemplates the recovery of undepreciated investments and decommissioning costs for other electric generation facilities (such as PNM’s natural gas assets listed above that are in rate base and were granted a certificate of convenience and necessity prior to January 1, 2015) if the NMPRC requires that they be retired and replaced with lower or zero carbon dioxide emitting resources to comply with the increas ed renewable energy 
and zero -carbon standards of the Energy Transition Act.  
1. In 2020, the NMPRC ordered the abandonment of SJG S at June 30, 2022 and recovery and financing of 
the associated undepreciated investments  and other costs  through Energy Transition Bonds . 
2. See note 16 in the 10K
 for a discussion on SJGS settlement and restructuring matters affecting recovery 
of SJGS and PVNGS undepreciated inves tments.  
3. PNM has communicated its intent to exit its ownership interest in Four Corners no later than the 
expiration of participation and coal supply agreements in 2031.  
Aided by the Energy Transition Act, PNM will continue down the path of transitioning ex isting energy resources 
to carbon -free resources. Going forward, our resource planning will achieve dramatic reductions in carbon 
emissions and lead us to a clean portfolio of electricity generation:  
• By 2023, PNM expects to far exceed the United States' vo luntary commitment to the Paris Agreement(1) 
of a 26% to 28% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2025 ; 
• PNM plans to exit coal  generation no later than 2031 ; and  
• PNM has set a goal for its electricity generation to reach 100% emissions -free by 2040, five years 
ahead of the state carbon- free mandate.  
 
1 The Paris Agreement's goal is to strengthen the g lobal response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global 
temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre- industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the 
temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  
11 
 In July 2019, PNM took the next step in the transition to carbon -free resources by filing its application to exit 
SJGS and includ ed different scenarios for the replacement resources necessary to provide New Mexico with 
affordable, reliable energy as we transition away from coal. The filing also requested securitization financing 
treatment of the projected undepreciated i nvestment in SJGS  and approval of the recommended replacement 
power resources.  Following hearings held in December 2019 and January 2020, the NMPRC approved PNM’s 
abandonment of SJGS and securitization financing on April 1, 2020 and approved a replacement  resource  
portfolio  on July 29, 2020  consisting of renewable resources and battery storage capacity . 
The roadmap for these important decisions is developed through a comprehensive research and planning process known as the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP).  
The IRP covers a 20 -year planning period that is updated every three years and filed with the NMPRC. PNM was 
required to file its next IRP in July 2020. In recognition of the pending decision for the replacement of SJGS, the filing deadline was extended to early 2021. Our most recently completed  IRP, filed in 2017, is available at 
www.pnm.com/irp.
 The IRP examines many scenarios with the purpose of defining the optimal portfolio for 
generating and transmitt ing electricity from the perspectives of reliability, customer cost and environmental 
impact . 
PNM will utilize the IRP planning process to evaluate multiple pathways to reach its goal of 100% emissions -free 
energy by 2040. With the passage of the Energy Transition Act, the State of New Mexico has put forth new 
mandates for investor -owned utilities to be 100% carbon free by 2045. As wind and solar generation costs have 
significantly decreased , and newer energy storage and other advanced technologies continue to progress, PNM 
will phase out natural gas emissions and complete the transition to 100% carbon -free generation earlier than 
2045 – by 2040.  
Climate/2 Degree Scenario Planning  
PNM has adva nced our understanding of climate/2 degree scenario planning by participating in the Electric 
Power Research Institute's (EPRI) Understanding Climate Scenarios & Goal Setting Activities program. The program is focused on characterizing and analyzing curren t scientific understanding of the relationship of 
individual electric utilities' carbon emissions and global temperature goals. Activities include analyzing current scientific understanding, identifying technical issues and insights to assist companies in evaluating various 
proposals, developing approaches to climate scenario planning, informing decision -making and engaging 
stakeholders. As PNM expands its sustainability story, EPRI's work has also been informational in gaining a 
better understanding of how  to implement the Task Force on Climate- Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
recommendations for sustainability reporting. While PNM has not conducted a 2 -degree scenario analysis, our 
commitment to becoming 100% carbon -free by 2040 produces a carbon emiss ions reduction trajectory that 
tracks with the ranges of climate scenario pathways consistent with limiting the global average warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius.  
Energy Efficiency  
Another important and effective focus of our efforts is energy efficien cy, which is included in the IRP and 
embedded in our overall strategy for the future. Reducing energy usage through organic technological evolution and as a result of strong and effective energy efficiency programs at both PNM and TNMP is perhaps the best way to avoid emissions and reduce the need for new generation resources.   12 
 Since 2007,  PNM  energy efficiency  programs have saved almost 4.5 billion 
kilowatt hours of electricity -  enough to power approximately 660,000 
homes for a year. These programs have kept an estimated 2.7 million metric 
tons of carbon dioxide out of the air and saved over 1.5 billion gallons of water.   
TNMP has been honored by Energy Star f ive consecutive years for successful 
energy efficiency programs. In April 20 20, TNM P was honored with its third  
consecutive Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award for its High -
Performance Homes Program.  
TNMP energy efficiency programs began in 2002 and  have helped save  more 
than  210 million kilowatt hours of electricity – enough to power 
approximately 2 5,000 homes for a year. These programs have also provided 
$42 million in customer incentives and kept an estimated 148,498  metric tons of CO
2 out of the air.  
Working Together to Effect Real Change  
Real change is possible. But it is not easy. In order to accomplish meaningful results, we will be working to partner even more closely with our stakeholders. We have many things to accomplish to reach these 
important goals, including obtaining regulatory approval for each significant element of our plan. By working 
together, we can achieve real change and exit coal by 2031 , reach 100% emissions ‐free energy by 2040,  and 
implement an energy mix that will benefit our customers and our communities for generati ons to come.  
Environmental Policy  & Management   
PNM  and TNMP  are dedicated  to protecting  our environment  and complying with  all regulations.  We recognize  
and believe  in the importance  of protecting  human  health  and preserving  the environment.  We accomplish  this 
through  careful planning,  strong  policies,  robust  controls  and excellent operations.  Read  more  from  our 
Environmental Policy . 
Environmental  Management  System   
PNM  and TNMP  are leaders  in the utility  industry  for minimizing  and mitigating  the environmental  impacts  of 
utility  work  by having a strong  Environmental  Management  System  (EMS) , which  is rooted  in our Environmental  
Policy  and is based upon  the international ISO 14001  standard  for Environmental  Management  Systems.   
The overall goal  of the EMS  is to ensure  continuous  improvement  in the Company's  environmental  performance  
and foster  a Company -wide  environmental  stewardship  ethic.  Our EMS  tools  ensure  that all Company  
employees  incorporate  environmental  stewardship  in their  daily  activities.  The foundation  of the EMS  is the 
Environmental Screening Process.  Before  fieldwork  or new  projects  begin,  PNM  and TNMP  employees  screen  
their  activities  to identify  potential  issues  associated  with  compliance  requirements  and resource  protection.  
These issues  include:   
• habitat  and threatened  and endangered  species,  
• water  and riparian  area  sensitivities,   
13 
 • cultural resources,  and  
• federal,  state  and local jurisdictional requirements  and permitting  
If an issue  is identified,  work  does  not proceed  until  environmental  clearance , containing  adequate  and 
appropriate  precautions,  stipulations  and permits , has been  issued.  This system  has allowed  the Company  to 
establish  a significant  database  of environmental  and culturally  sensitive  areas  in New  Mexico  and Texas,  using 
existing  government  resources  as well as data  the Company  has specifically  collected  or funded.  The Company  
also requires  regular  comprehensive  environmental training  for operational employees  and some  contractors  at 
least  every  two years.  
Emissions  
PNM, o ur sole regulated  utility  with generation operations , 
has significantly  reduce d emissions over  the past  15 years  
through  investment in pollution  control  technologies,  the 
increased  use of renewable  energy  and natural gas, and 
the development  of extensive energy  efficiency  programs  
for customers.   
The retirement of Units 2 and 3 of SJGS in 2017 resulted in 
significant emission reductions . 
Emissions Reduction Goals  
Looking forward, we have set even more ambitious goals 
to slash our air emissions as we transition away from coal and increase our share of renewable energy generation. Our proposed generation portfolio would achieve dramatic 
reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, as well as other 
emissions, with the full exit from SJGS in 2022, all coal by 
the end of 2031, and our goal to be emissions -free by 2040.  
14 
 Water 
Operating  in the arid Southwest  in New  Mexico  and Western  Texas,  we understand  the importance  of protecting 
scarce  water  resources.  That is why our plants  have implemented some of the most innovative water 
conservation technologies in the industry , such as using treated municipal effluent for water- cooling and air-
cooling.  And it is why we have set a goal to reduce freshwater use 80% by 2035 and 9 0% by 2040  from 2005 
levels as we shift our portfolio to carbon -free sources.  
PNM is proud to be a participant in the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, the largest nuclear power plant 
in the U.S., and the only nuclear energy facility in the world that uses treated sewage effluent for 100% of its cooling water. The sewage effluent water is produced from the metropolitan Phoenix area. The wastewater is 
treated again at the plant's water reclamation facility and then stored in an 80 -acre reservoir for use in the 
plant's nine cooling towers. More than 20 billion gallons of water are recycled each year.  
 Water Use 
Over the last decade, o ur water efficiency 
investments, along with our robust energy 
efficiency and renewable energy programs , have 
reduced our fresh water usage from 4.63 billion 
gallons in 2005 to 2.87 billion gallons in 2019. That’s 
a reduction of over 3 8% of total water diverted by 
our generation plants.  
As we move forward on our mission to achieve 
100% carbon -free generation by 2040, more 
significant water savings will be gained. Shutting down SJGS in 2022 and exiting Four Corners by  
2031 will allow us to reach our goals for reduced 
use of freshwater of  80% by 2035 and 90% by 2040.  
 
15 
 Water Scarcity  
Our operations are centered within arid regions ; therefore, managing the risk of water scarcity is central to how 
we plan and work. We have well -established procedures to minimize our water use and plans to manage water 
needs in case of drought. Measures we have implemented include:  
• water balance audits to identify inefficiencies or alternative operations to reduce water 
consumption;  
• shortage Sharing Agreement among key water users on the San Juan River to share shortages 
resulting from drought; and  
• installation of air- coolin g technology at Afton to minimize water use.  
Looking forward, as we shift our portfolio away from coal to lower water- intensity natural gas  and minimal 
water -need renewables, we will dramatically reduce our water demand and risk exposure to water scarcity.  The 
only significant water- reliant plant in the future will be the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, which already 
uses 100% municipal wastewater  for cooling , significantly reducing  its reliance on freshwater.  
Effluent Water 
We are committed to responsibly managing effluent water. Key to this commitment is that all our plants are 
zero discharge with no return flows. All water diverted is consumed on -site, either by evaporation through 
cooling towers or evaporation ponds. There  is zero once -through cooling water.  
Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR)  
EPA's 2015 Coal Combustion Residual Rule  
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published its final rule for the Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities (CCR Rule ) on April 17, 2015. This 
final rule was the culmination of extensive study on the effects of coal ash on the environment and public health. The rule establishes that coal combustion 
residuals (CCR) are a non -hazardous waste and addresses the risks from CC R disposal into surface 
impoundments and landfills. The CCR Rule is not applicable to SJGS as there are no CCR impoundments or 
landfills at the site nor is it applicable to mine placement of CCR and thus, San Juan Coal Mine.  
Management of CCR at SJGS and S an Juan Mine  
During coal combustion operations at SJGS to produce electricity, CCR generated at the SJGS is placed into trucks operated by the San Juan Coal Mine , which transport the CCR back to the mine for mine reclamation purposes.  
 In the reclamation process, the CCR is returned to the former surface mine pits where coal was mined. Use of 
CCR in this manner reduces mine reclamation costs because not as much new fill material is required. A portion 
of the CCR in the form of gypsum, approximately 200,000  tons per year, is sold for beneficial use to a third party.  
16 
  
The San Juan Coal Mine is required to have a reclamation plan that is approved by Mining and Minerals Division (MMD) of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. MMD rece ives oversight for its 
programs from the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE). Use of the CCR from SJGS is 
specifically approved for mine reclamation at the San Juan Coal Mine. The mine reclamation plan is intended to 
reconstruct as  many of the pre -mining conditions as practical.  
 The CCR generated by SJGS is sent to the former surface mine pits for reclamation at San Juan Coal Mine where 
they are placed in mine pits and covered with at least 10 feet of overburden and topsoil. This process minimizes CCR contact with surface water. In addition, because the San Juan Coal Mine is located in an arid region, the opportunity for the CCR to be impacted from precipitation is lower compared to wetter climates. Monitoring equipment is placed a bove and below the CCR in the mine pits to detect any movement of water into and out of 
the CCR. Mine operators are required to post bonds to ensure that mine reclamation is properly performed.  
 
The San Juan Coal Company has developed a groundwater -monitor ing plan to monitor changes in quality of the 
groundwater resource during mining and subsequent reclamation. The monitoring plan includes collection of 
groundwater information from specified hydrogeologic units.  The goal is to collect data on groundwater quality 
and quantity and to monitor any changes that may occur as a result of mining and reclamation  and if changes 
are detected, operations can be adjusted to prevent adverse effects. As such, the monitoring includes adaptive management to eit her adjust operations or adjust the monitoring. Monitoring reports are reviewed by MMD, 
who has the authority to require additional monitoring wells during mining or reclamation. Further, prior to bond release after reclamation, OSMRE reviews monitoring re ports and, if necessary, works with MMD to adjust 
the groundwater monitoring plan to ensure potential effects are avoided or minimized.  
PNM’s Groundwater Recovery Systems  
In 2008, PNM chose to proactively install a groundwater recovery trench below the plant. This trench is designed to capture any potential release of discharges from SJGS. The trench became operational in January 2010 and regular monitoring data is provided to the NMED. At the end of 2018, PNM completed installation and began operating a se cond groundwater recovery system as part of a 2012 consent decree among PNM, San Juan Coal 
Mine and the Sierra Club. This groundwater recovery system, consisting of an impermeable, underground concrete -like slurry wall and groundwater recovery trench, is d esigned to capture groundwater downstream of 
SJGS and the San Juan Mine.  
Studies of the Impacts of CCR to Groundwater at the San Juan Coal Mine  
Multiple studies have been conducted to determine whether the CCR from SJGS have the potential to come in contact with groundwater at the San Juan Mine and affect the underlying groundwater quality. In 2017, the USGS published the Hydrologic Reassessment &  Numerical Simulation of Groundwater Flow, San Juan Mine, San 
Juan County, 2010 -13, which indicates that the rate of re -saturation of the mine spoil is expected to be 
extremely slow due to New Mexico's arid climate and the low rate of recharge to the aquifer. The USGS Report discusses how the low groundwater volume and velocity in the coal seam combined with the high dilution 
potential of the San Juan River alluvium (soils and sediment deposited by the river) would greatly reduce any potential impacts to th e river in the unlikely event that the CCR affected the groundwater quality. In addition, 
constituents are not released from CCR in high concentrations when CCR are exposed to ground water and these 
constituents are likely to attenuate through chemical and  physical mechanisms to negligible concentrations in 
ground water well before reaching the arroyos and the San Juan River.  17 
 After the USGS published their 2017 report, and based on USGS recommendations, San Juan Coal Mine 
implemented additional best managem ent practices in the reclamation process. These practices included 
increasing the amount of spoil material surrounding and between coal ash layers placed in the surface mine pits to further minimize the potential for restoration of the mine pits.  
Four Corn ers Power Plant  
PNM owns 13% capacity of Four Corners . Arizona Public Service (APS), the operator of Four Corners, currently 
disposes of CCR in surface impoundments and dry storage areas. The disposal of CCR at Four Corners is subject 
to the EPA's CCR rule . Prior to implementation of the rule, Four Corners, located on the Navajo Nation, was 
already subject to federal regulatory requirements designed to monitor for potential groundwater and surface water impacts of plant operations. On December 19, 2019, EPA  released a proposed rule establishing a federal 
permitting program for the handling of CCR within the boundaries of Native American reservations. Permits for units within the boundaries of Native American lands would be due 18 months after the effective d ate of the 
rule. The final rule is expected in late 2020.    
Four Corners is in compliance with the CCR rule and is meeting all applicable requirements. For facilities like Four Corners, the rule requires ongoing, phased groundwater monitoring. In addition , the rule specifies that, by 
October 17, 2017, electric utility companies that own or operate CCR disposal units, such as APS, must have collected sufficient groundwater sampling data to initiate a detection monitoring program. To the extent that 
certain constituents were identified through this initial detection monitoring at levels above thresholds provided 
in the CCR rule, the rule required the initiation of an assessment monitoring program by April 15, 2018. In 2018, 
APS completed the statistical analy ses for its CCR disposal units that triggered assessment monitoring. APS 
determined that some of its CCR disposal units at Four Corners will need to undergo corrective action. In 
addition, to the extent that compliance with the CCR rule did not otherwise trigger the need for these CCR 
disposal units to close, such units must cease operating and initiate closure by October of 2020.  
APS initiated an assessment of corrective measures on January 14, 2019, and anticipates completing this 
assessment in 2020, duri ng which time APS will gather additional groundwater data, solicit input from the 
public, host a public hearing, and select appropriate remedies.  
In January 2020, APS released the Annual Groundwater Monitoring and Corrective Action Report for 2019. This 
report is the formal regulatory method for releasing annual groundwater monitoring data.  
Waste  
We are committed to reducing and safely managing waste generated through our operations. We have well -
established programs that meet environmental regulatory compliance requirements.  We perform regular 
reporting to the regulatory agencies and audit our waste program.  
Team  Green   
Team  Green  is an employee -led program,  in place  since  2007,  which  has focused  on waste  diversion  at all our 
facilities.  Waste  diversion  is the practice  of diverting waste  from  landfills,  either  through  recycling  or reducing 
use. Employees  at each  facility  develop  programs  and practices  that make  sense  for each  location.  Members  18 
 meet  regularly  to share  successes, tips and tools  with  team  members at other locations . Team  Green  has 
ensured  that we have  met annual  solid  waste  reduction  goals  for over  a decade.  In fact,  PNM  received  
recognition  from  the New  Mexico  Recycling  Coalition  twice  for its recycling  efforts,  once  for its overall  corporate  
recycling  program  as Business Recycler  of the Year,  and once  for recycling  efforts  at its Ruidoso  operations  
office.  PNM  Resources  met the 2019 Corporate  Waste  Goal with  over  15 facilities  meeting  or achieving a waste  
diversion  rate of 65%.  
Biodiversity  and Land Use  
We are committed to protecting special status species, habitats, ecosystems, and cultural resources everywhere 
we operate. Biodiversity and natural habitat protection are key considerations for PNM  and TNMP . As part of 
our commitment to mitigate and restore natural habitat at all of our significant operational locations, we have procedures to protect, enhance, or restore land throughout our service territory.  
Environmental Protection of Lands  
We work closely with local communities to identify and protect environmentally and culturally sensitive areas. 
We have a robust review process whereby  we analyze  infrastructure developments and maintenance projects to 
understand the risk of disturbance to sensitive habita ts and archeological sites, as well as community concerns. 
We undertake comprehensive environmental reviews and stakeholder engagement to identify potential biodiversity and community impacts, and seek input from residents, businesses, landowners, Native A merican 
communities, government and other stakeholders to address and mitigate concerns.  
When a project has the potential to affect the rights or resources of a Native American community, we follow established regulatory and company guidelines to engage  tribal communities  with respect . We are committed to 
continue working  collaboratively with the Native American communities to avoid or minimize our impacts  and 
foster lasting beneficial relationships . 
Avian  Protection  
Both  PNM  and TNMP  have  developed  Avian  Protection  Plans  (APP)  in accordance  with  the guidelines  established  
by the Avian Powerline  Interaction  Committee,  which  includes  representation  from  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  
Service.  Each  APP includes commitments  to both  reactive  and proactive  avian  protection  efforts.  
Since  2014 , the Company  has spent  over  $8.2 million  to make  distribution poles  avian -safe.  The cost to bird 
guard  a structure  is dependent  upon  the location,  the necessity  to plan  an outage  to bird guard,  the aerial 
equipment  located  on the pole,  and the pole  configuration.  
In an effort  to encourage  safe nesting for raptors  and other  large  birds,  and to improve  and maintain  reliability,  
PNM  has completed a large  project  installing  hundreds  of perch  diverters  along  a 212-mile  main  transmission  
line that has experienced  bird-related outages. PNM  engaged a local  avian  conservation,  research  and education  
organization  to help  determine  the species  nesting  and the location  of the nests  on the structures.  This data  
assisted  in identifying  the cause  of interruptions  that were  occurring  along  the line.  Findings  showed  that when  
the birds  perch  on certain  parts  of the transmission  structures, their  excrement  can “stream”  and bridge  the 
clearance  between  the power  lines,  causing faults  on the line.  Installing  perch  diverters  will discourage  the birds  
from  sitting  on certain locations  on the structure  while  encouraging them  to locate  to a safer location . The 19 
 diverters  were installed  on over  400 structures  by line crews  who  are flown  to each structure  in a helicopter,  
and the project  was done  while  the line remained  energized  to minimize  outages.  
San Juan  River  Basin  Recovery  Implementation  Program  
PNM  is an active  participant  in the San Juan  River  Basin  Recovery Implementation  Program.  This innovative  
endeavor  was developed through  cooperation  among  federal agencies,  the States  of New  Mexico  and Colorado,  
Native  American  nations  and tribes,  water users  and conservation  interests  with  the intent  to assist  in the 
recovery  of the endangered  Colorado  Pikeminnow  and Razorback Sucker  in the San Juan  River.  As part of the 
program,  SJGS  partially  funded  and maintains  a fish passage adjacent  to its river diversion  to allow  these native  
fish access  to critical habitat . 
Embedding  Sustainability  
Electric  Vehicles  Fleet  
PNM  Resources  recognizes  that electric  vehicles  provide  an opportunity  
to reduce  the environmental  impact  of transportation.  As we transform  
PNM's  generation  resources  to a cleaner  energy  portfolio,  customers  
can feel good  about  charging their  vehicles  on the PNM  system.  Both  
PNM  and TNMP  consider  the potential  impact  of greater  electric  vehicle  
adoption  in planning for grid reliability and resiliency.   
PNM  Resources  is leading  by example  on electric  vehicles  with  46 
electrified  vehicles,  including hybrids  ranging  from  passenger  cars to 
heavy  duty  trucks  in our fleet , and we installed  an additional  32 charging  stations  at company  locations  in 2019.   
PNM  provides  support  to customers  wanting to make  the switch  to cleaner  vehicles.  Read  more  here . 
Sustainability  Research  and Tools  
PNM  Resources  recognizes  that expectations  regarding  commitments  to sustainability  and the demonstration  of 
sustainable business  practices  are rising  among  our stakeholders,  including customers,  investors,  employees,  
and other  industry  stakeholders.  
To help  us advance  corporate  sustainability  strategy  and drive  through  our economic,  environmental  and social 
responsibilities,  PNM Resources  funds  various  electric  utility -centric  sustainability  research  efforts  through  EPRI, 
a non-profit  organization for public interest energy and environmental research.   
As a result of the cle an energy transformation and our commitment to become emissions -free by 2040, PNM 
Resources has continued funding and expanded our participation in  EPRI programs. These programs are focused 
on strategic science, energy and climate policy, understanding climate goal setting and the 2 degree scenario 
analysis. They also look into key clean energy technology trends, including insights from new research on deep decarbonization pathways . These  programs  have  provided  PNM  Resources  with valuable  insights,  information  
and tools  to affirm  that our 100%  carbon -free goal  sets us on a course  that aligns  with  the international climate  
goals  and our desire  to be a truly  sustainable  company.  
20 
 Social  
PNM Resources has a long tradition of supporting the communities that it serv es in New Mexico and Texas  and 
is committed to fostering positive relationships with stakeholders. At the heart of everything we do are our core 
values:  
 Safety for ourselves, our co -workers, our customers and our communities depends  on every employee, 
every day . 
 Caring  about the welfare of others is a company tradition. It fosters a positive workplace, a focus on 
customers and dedicated community service . 
Personal Integrity and Honest Communication guide our dealings and keep us  accountable to our 
stakeholders and to each other . 
Customers  
We strive  to deliver  a superior  customer  experience.  PNM,  as a vertically  integrated  utility,  has more  
opportunities  to connect  with  our end -use customers  than TNMP, whose customers are Retail Electric Providers 
operating in Texas . PNM  continues  to focus  its efforts  to enhance  the customer  experience  through  customer  
service  improvements,  including billing  and payment  options,  strategic  customer  engagement,  and improved  
communications.  These  efforts  are supported  by market  research  to understand  the varying  needs  of customers, 
identifying  and establishing  valued  services  and programs, and proactively  communicating and engaging with  
customers. PNM  supports  our customers  with  bill assistance through a number of different avenue s. These 
include:   
• Good  Neighbor  Fund : PNM  customers  who  are facing  a financial emergency  can receive  a grant  to help  
pay part or all of a past -due P NM bill. This is funded through  generous  donations  from  our customers  
and employees  which  are matched  by PNM.  PNM  also makes  corporate  contributions  to this fund.   
• LIHEAP : Eligibility  is determined  by several  factors,  including household  income  and immigration  status. 
Benefit  amount  is based  on other  factors,  including income,  household  size,  household  members'  ages,  
and disabilities .  
• Moratorium : Customers  who  qualify  for low-inc ome  help  from  LIHEAP  may  also qualify  for the New  
Mexico  heating  season moratorium.  Certain  customers' electricity  cannot  be turned  off from  November  
15, 2019  through  March  16, 2020.   
• PNM  Payment  Arrangements : Customers  that receive  a PNM  bill with  a disconnect  notice  and are 
unable  to pay the amount  due by the "pay  no later  than"  date,  can request  a payment  extension.  Not all 
accounts  are eligible  for more  time  to pay an already  past -due a
mount.   
• Medical Certificate  Program : PNM  provides  information  on the medical  certificate  program  with  bills 
that are subject  to disconnection  for nonpayment.  The customer  must  qualify  financially  through  the 
Human  Services  Division  in order  to qualify  for this exemption.   
21 
 • Energy  Efficiency  Prog rams : PNM  supports  several other  energy  efficiency  programs  that help  customers  
save  money . 
TNMP's  primary  customer  focus  in the Texas  deregulated  market  concerns  reliability  and supporting deregulated  
market  operations.  For end-use customers, that means  the lights  are on and that transactions  with  Retail 
Electric  Providers  are completed  within  market  protocols.  TNMP  also focuses  on preparing  customers  for 
outages  when  severe  weather  is forecasted.  Most  critical  is providing effective outage  reporting  and restoration  
updates  from  customer  service  and automated  phone  services  in conjunction  with  TNMP's  outage -management  
system.  
Customer  privacy  policies  can be found  on pnm.com  and tnmp.com . Our customer  service  employees  are 
trained  to handle  the broad  range  of inquires  that commonly  come  from  our customers.  We have  Customer  
Experience Advisors  that are fluent  in English  and Spanish.  We handle  approximately  4,500 Spanish  calls  
monthly,  which  represents  about  6% of our call volume.  Spanish -speaking customers  also have  the opportunity  
to conduct  electronic  transactions  via our Spanish  Automated  Phone  System , and we offer helpful  information  in 
English  and Spanish  on pnm.com . Demand  in our customer  contact  center  for languages  other  than  English  and 
Spanish  is minimal and typically  the customer  is able  to interpret the call through  a family  member  or friend.  For 
customers  who  are deaf,  there is a TTY service  that enables  interaction  with  our customer  service  team  via the 
telephone.   
Employees  
PNM Resources looks to its more than 1,600 dedicated employees to transform our business model and le ad us 
into an emission s-free generation future by being part of a diverse and inclusive workforce, actively being 
developed and trained to meet evolving skill set requirements, participating in succession planning, and 
leveraging our employee wellness programs.  
Diversity and Inclusion  
At PNM Resources, we value the diversity of our workforce and actively seek opportunities for incorporating diversity within our family of companies. We believe a diverse workforce enriches our environment and helps us better 
meet the needs of our  employees, customers and 
shareholders. PNM Resources employs over 1,600 
employees in New Mexico and Texas.   
We focus on promoting diversity and opportunity across our 
business as we recognize how critical it is for the success of our company and our cult ure.  Our commitment to diversity 
is reflected in the high proportion of women and minorities 
represented across all levels of our organization.  
To promote diversity , we take a multi -tiered approach. We provide  Unconscious B ias awareness training as part 
of our leadership development courses. We discuss our diversity goals with our hiring managers and undertake 
targeted recruitment with organizations including Women in Business and Hire Our Heroes. On an annual basis, we review and update our diversity and  affirmative action plans.  
22 
  
The company has numerous employee policies that govern hiring practices, parental leave, health and safety, 
employee performance evaluations, anti- corruption, and anti- trust. Our Do The Right Thing code  of conduct is 
an over- arching guiding document that lays the foundation of what is expected of all employees. We also abide 
by our Equal Employment Opportunity policy  and we believe that this helps to cultivate our environment of 
personal and professional growth.  
Pay Equality  
PNM is committed to the principle of equal pay for equal work for our employees and we seek to ensure 
employees are paid equitably for substantially similar work. Pay equity is reviewed three times per year  
according to factors including role, years of industry -related experience, performance and tenure, among other 
factors . Where a discrepancy might be identified, there is an internal review process to evaluate and, where 
appropriate, address it.  
Learning and Development  
We are committed to developing and retaining our highly skilled workforce. We have created programs 
designed to provide the necessary technical skills and leadership development to enable the long- term success 
of our company.  All employees are expected to develop an annual performance plan, with goals tied to 
corporate Key Results and department goals.  Our leaders are encouraged to engage in feedback conversations 
with their employees throughout the year, to foster communication, development and opportunities for growth.  
At PNM Resources, we approach our learning and development offerings through  the lens of an employee’s 
complete life -cycle and have established a Learning Governance Committee that is chartered to champion 
enterprise -wide development programs, training initiatives, and learning alignment.  
23 
 The Learning Governance Committee provide s oversight  and sets employee development policies and strategies 
that effect corporate -wide learning initiatives focused on compliance, safety, technical skill development, 
leadership, and employee career development to ensure an agile workforce.  
Leadership Development Program  
To develop current and future leaders of our company, we have implemented a robust three -tiered, stackable, 
holistic approach offering learning and networking opportunities to participants across various business 
functions an d geographic locations.  Participants have the option to follow a structured three -year development 
journey or tailor their learning journey to reflect completed prerequisites and level of prior experience.  The 
Program design evolves with the changing nee ds of our customers and employees, advancing technologies , and 
evolving capability requirements.  
Supervisor Essentials  – Provide s early career supervisors and managers with essential managerial skills and 
knowledge of corporate requirements.   
Leadership F undamentals  –Facilitate s a shift from managing effectively to leading and  equip s leaders with the 
skills to set strategic direction in collaboration with their teams.  
Leading the Organization  –Increase s leadership competency, coaching skills and the abilit y to influence the 
enterprise through servant leadership excellence.  
Our current Le adership Development Program 
grew out of our successful pilot program, Next 
Level Leadership Academy. The hybrid pilot 
program provided the supporting data for 
expanding to  a three -tiered model and the 
recommended offerings that are  part of our 
current program.  27 employees participated in 
35 hours of instruction in 2019.  
New Hires  
PNM  Resources  provides a welcoming environment for new hires through various programs that are 
continuously reviewed and updated, including:  
• New Hire Welcome – Welcome, engage and introduce new employees to our Company and culture.  
• Company Orientation –  Further integr ate our new employees by providing a holistic company 
orientation and broader overview of our operations.  
Ongoing Training  
PNM  Resources  provides technical, safety, and compliance training as set forth by Federal and State standards 
and the Company. We do this not because we have to, but because it’s the right thing to do.   
24 
 Employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ( IBEW ) are also eligible for 
formal apprenticeship programs in certain classifications, designed to progress  individuals to journey -level 
proficiency.  
With approximately 12.8% of our workforce at risk of retirement as of December 31, 2019, PNM  Resources  
works to ensure institutional knowledge and technical expertise is maintained within the company. To that end , 
we have developed a program to identify key and critical positions to focus our efforts on transferring  and 
retain ing knowledge. We have implemented a robust interview process program for learning and sharing 
knowledge of those in key and critical positio ns, particularly as individuals move to retirement.   
Collective Bargaining Agreements  
As of December 31, 2019, approximately 40% of our workforce population was represented by collective 
bargaining agreements. The current TNMP and IBEW Local 66 contract e xpires August 31, 2021. In December 
2019, PNM and IBEW Local 611 agreed to a successor collective bargaining agreement effective May 1, 2020 through April 30, 2023.   
Cultural Transformation and Employee Engagement  
A Culture Transformation initiative, Powe ring Change, commenced in 2019, placing focus on our Cultural Beliefs 
of: Why Here?, Embrace Collaboration, Transparency Wins , and Own it . The program also align s and develop s 
leaders  to propel current and future initiatives in areas of: Safety, Customer Experience, Accountability, 
Communication and Wellness.  Employee engagement programs are being encapsulated into Powering Change, 
ensuring alignment and embracing culture, engagement a nd well -being holistically.   
Understanding and maximizing employee engagement is fundamental to the well -being of our workforce and 
the success of our company.  We have found over time that the best way to understand what our employees are 
thinking and to identify potential areas for improvement is through small focus groups. We regularly  convene 
varying group s of employees to survey their thoughts, opinions and ideas. We use the insights learned to make 
PNM Resources a better place for our employees, custo mers and community.  
For example, in 2019 our New Mexico  Operations and Human Resources departments collaborated on a series 
of employee forums to identify areas of improvement in the work environment, work processes and 
collaboration.  The forums provided i nsights and ideas that we were able to institute across the company  to 
improve attraction and retention and build stronger work environments and culture within our technical teams . 
It is in strengthening our foundation of Culture, with our transformation i nitiative and alignment of our 
employee engagement programs, where we will better drive business results, company values and individual 
aspirations.    
Employee Turnover  
We regularly monitor employee turnover to identify potential issues and improve performance. Turnover data is reviewed at least twice a year at the executive level for each business unit and department to understand employee turnover  and opportunities for making changes . Our voluntary employee turnover for 2019 was  
approximately  12% a cross the Company.  25

 Safety  
Safety is the first priority of 
our business and a core value 
of the Company. It is a key 
performance indicator of the 
overall success of PNM Resources.  
Our CEO has ultimate responsibility for safety, 
with regular oversight and guidance from our Board of Directors. Our SVP of Operations is in charge of our 
safety programs with day -to-day management led by the VP of Operations at each business unit. We have 
overall corporate safety guidelines and an employee manual and specific  guidance for different operations and 
roles, including generation, transmission & distribution, and meter readers.  Occupational safety training and 
assessments are provided to all employees based on position title , regulatory requirements , and company need . 
We are guided in our actions by our Safety Management System , which  provides clear direction, objectives and 
targets for managing safety performance and minimizing risks.  
Through the Safety Management System, we:

 Resilience  and Reliability  
Emergency  Preparedness  
In 2019,  PNM  Resources  formed  a designated  enterprise  Crisis  Management  and Resilience  function  to establish  
and maintain  a capability  that plans  for and effectively  manages  rapidly  evolving  crises  that pose  a strategic,  
financial,  operational,  or reputational threat to PNM  Resources’  infrastructure,  personnel,  or customers.   The 
designated  function  is implementing an enterprise  “All Hazards”  response  plan  and business  continuity  prog ram 
to establish  the framework  for how  PNM  Resources  responds  to and maintains  operational resilience  during any 
emergency.  PNM  Resources  currently  maintains  hazard  and business  area- specific  response  and continuity  
plans,  focusing on areas  that present unique  challenges,  such  as storms  and other  severe  weather  events,  
wildfires,  cyberattacks,  and pandemics.  We perform  hazard  and impact  assessments of our infrastructure  based  
on industry  standards,  best  practices,  and a tiered  approach  focusing on greatest  risk to safety,  security,  and 
service  reliability.   
Reliability  
We measure our reliability and  benchmark our performance  against other utilities using industry -standard 
reliability metrics . Below are data for our PNM and TNMP operations.

Community  
PNM  Resources  has a long  tradition  of supporting the communities  it serves  in New  Mexico  and Texas.  The 
Company  demonstrates  its core  value  of caring  through  the PNM  Resources  Foundation,  corporate  giving,  
widespread  employee volunteerism,  and PNM's  low-
income  assistance  program.   
PNM  Resources  Foundation   
The PNM  Resources  Foundation  is a separate nonprofit, 
tax-exempt corporation governed by a board of trustees 
comprised of PNM employees. The PNM Resources 
Foundation  supported  56 New  Mexico  nonprofits  in 
2019 with  $750,000  toward  their  missions through  the 
New  Century  of Service  Gran t Program.  This grant  is 
designed  to promote  economic  development,  education  
and the environment  within  the PNM  service  area.  The 
28 
 grants  are awarded  to organizations  that work  to innovate  new  products  and services  that,  in turn,  grow  and 
develop  businesses  in New  Mexico;  create  collaborative  community  spaces  for public  use; and provide  
educational  opportunities  that support  economic  development.   
In 2020,  the PNM  Resources  Foundation  grants  will focus  on improving identified  areas  of importance  in New  
Mexico  that help  move  the state  forward  together.  Over  the next  three  years,  these  “Vision  Grants”  will 
contribute  approximately  $2.5  million  toward  these  specific  impact  areas:  reducing homelessness, increasing  
community  safety,  increasing  access  to affordable  housing,  and reducing carbon  emissions.   
United Way of Central New Mexico (UWCNM) and the Albuquerque Community Foundation (ACF) have joined 
to form the DEI United Fund to  support, promote and  advance  Diversity,  Equity  and Inclusion practices 
in the four  counties each organization serves. Initial funding has been provided by  the PNM  Resources 
Foundation , UWCNM and ACF.  
The DEI United Fund  will identify  short - and long- term activities  to foster change leading to mo re equitable, 
racially  just and sustainable solutions for systemic change. The activities conducted by the two organizations will 
be rooted in community and will include training, educational support,  and funding for a range 
of practices.  Training would be  offered to community leaders and decision -makers across sectors to strengthen 
their actions to embed equitable practices in their organizations.  
Employee  Volunteerism   
Employees  across  the Company  demonstrate  their  
involvement  and dedication  to the communities  in which  they  
live and work  through  their  donations  of time,  money  (which  
the Company  may  match  through  its Volunteer  Grants  or 
Matching Grants  programs)  and United  Way  giving.  We also 
encourage  employees  to participate  in the Company -
sponsored  Day of Service  event  that is held  annually,  
providing employees  the opportunity  to take  a workday  to 
connect  with  their  communities.  In addition,  employees  are 
offered  eight  hours  of volunteer  time  off to support  the 
organizations  of their  choice.  In 2019,  approximately  850 PNM  
and TNMP  employees  and retirees  contributed  more  than  
13,300 volunteer  hours  serving  their  local  communities.   
Low-Income  Customer  Assistance   
For more  than  a decade,  PNM  has focused  on outreach  efforts  to connect  low-income  customers  with  nonprofit  
community  service  providers  offering  support  and help  with  such  needs  as utility  bills,  food,  clothing,  medical 
programs,  services  for seniors,  and weatherization.  In 2019 alone,  PNM  hosted  46 assistance  fairs  throughout  its 
service  territory  to help  low-income  customers.  The PNM  Good  Neighbor  Fund  provided  $440,421 in utility  bill 
support  to 3,734  families  in 2019.   
29 
 American  Indian  Outreach   
PNM  continues  to work  extensively  with  many  American  Indian  Tribes  located  in New  Mexico  to build  trusting 
relationships  with  New  Mexico  tribal leaders.  In 2020,  PNM  renewed  our commitment  to the PNM  Navajo  
Nation  Workforce  Training  Scholarship  Program  by offering  another  $500,000  for the next  five years  to provide  
scholarships  to New  Mexico  students,  specifically  Navajo  tribal  members  in the Four  Corners  area.  PNM  
President  & CEO Pat Vincent -Collawn  and Navajo  Nation  President  Jonathan  Nez signed  a new  Memorandum  of 
Agreement to renew  PNM’s  commitment  to the program.  PNM  has been  financing  the program  since  2013  with  
$1.1  million  over  the last six years.  To date,  almost  700 Navajo  students  have  received  funding through  the 
program , resulting in  337 Navajo  graduates  earning  certificates,  assoc iate’s and bachelor’s  degrees.  The program  
was created  to help  minimize  the economic  impact  of PNM  complying with  federal visibility  standards  that 
resulted  in the closure  of two of the four  units  at SJGS  in 2018  and to ensure  that the Navajo  Nation  and Four  
Corners  area have  the trained  workforce  needed  for existing  and emerging  careers.   
Since 2011, PNM has sponsored Native American engineering students through our Native American Summer 
Internship program.   Each summer we try to place students in our N ew Mexico  Operations and Generation 
departments.   The intent is to provide students with practical engineering experience that complements their 
education; we’ve successfully hired four of these students after graduation.    
Light  Up Navajo   
PNM  joined  the Navajo  Nation  and the American  Public  Power  Association,  in partnership  with  the Navajo  Tribal 
Utility  Authority  (NTUA),  to launch  the Light  Up Navajo  Project  in the spring of 2019  with  the goal  of electrifying  
300 homes.  The Navajo  Nation  is the largest  Native  American  territory,  yet among  the 55,000  homes  located  on 
the 27,000  square  mile  reservation,  around  15,000  families  still do not have  electricity.  These homes  make  up 
75%  of all un-electrified  households  in the United  States.  PNM  sent  a crew  of four  journeyman  lineman  to work  
along -side NTUA  crews  to construct  32 new  poles  and run 1,800  feet of new  distribution  lines  in one week  of 
work.  Six existing  homes  that did not have  electricity  were  energized.  PNM  is one of 24 utilities  throughout  the 
country  who  participated  in this project  that helped  light  up Navajo  homes.

 Governance  
PNM  Resources  recognizes  that sustainability  is an integral part of achieving  long -term  shareholder value  and 
our strategic  goals.  Through  our regulated  utilities,  PNM  and TNMP,  we are dedicated  to continuing to serve  our 
customers  with  reliable,  affordable,  and environmentally  responsible  power  while  transforming  to a cleaner 
energy  portfolio  and maintaining  the reliability  and resiliency  of the electric  grid.  Corporate  responsibility  is 
embedded  in our organization's  culture  to Do the Right  Thing  and be the reason  everyone  goes  home  safely  
every  day.  Our sustainability  efforts  are managed  by our executive leadership  team  and overseen  by the Board  
of Directors.   
Leadership  and Oversight  
Our commitment to governance 
policies and practices that serve the interests of the Company and our shareholders, customers and 
communities is underscored by the 
following strong 
corporate 
governance practices  and facts for 
PNM Resources that are described further in our 
annual proxy 
statements :  
Our sustainability efforts, developed through research, benchmarking and engagement with our 
stakeholders, support our five 
strategic objectives identified by our Board and executive leadership team:  
• Create an environment where em ployees can succeed  
• Engage and earn the trust of our customers and stakeholders  
• Always strive for operational excellence  
• Create value for our shareholders  
• Transform our portfolio for a sustainable future  
In conjunction with these objectives, we remain  focused on three financial goals:  
• Earning authorized returns on our regulated businesses  
• Delivering earnings and dividend growth at or above industry -average  
• Maintaining solid investment grade metrics  
Management Oversight  
The executive team (comprised of our CEO, EVP Corporate Development  and Finance , SVP CFO, SVP General 
Counsel, SVP Public Policy, and SVP Utility Operations) plans and executes on programs designed to achieve 
31 
 PNM
 Resources' strategic goals, including investing in a clean, secure and sustainable resource portfolio and 
other corporate responsibility efforts. Management is also responsible for assessing significant risks, including 
the multiple risks and opportunities related to climate change matters, executi ng appropriate responses, and 
reporting to the Board on the status of risk activities. With Board oversight, Management prepared a Climate Change Report that details PNM's efforts to transition to a coal
-free g
eneration portfolio.  
Board Oversight  
Our well- qualified, diverse, and high- functioning Board of Directors  follows a regular meeting schedule to 
consider and address key issues, including those related to corporate responsibility and sustainability matters. In addition, the Board conducts an annual strategy session to consider new and emerging trends, consult with outside experts, and assess current strategies and initiatives. In recognition of the importance of sustainability to achieving long- term shareholder value and our strategic goals, s even members of our ten -member Board have 
environmental/sustainability expertise relevant to the Company's business of providing reliable, affordable and environmentally responsible power to its customers.  
Monitoring Risk.  The Board oversees the processes established to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor 
risks. Throughout the year, the Board assesses potential risks and considers the various challenges and 
opportunities presented by these risks, plans to mitigate the risks, and the impact these risks m ay have on our 
strategy, company and stakeholders.  
The Full Board Oversees the Significant Risks of Climate Change and Related Issues.  For many years, 
management has identified and reported to the Board on multiple risks and opportunities related to clima te 
change, including potential environmental regulation, transformation of PNM's generation portfolio, 
technological innovation, and availability of fuel and water for operations.  In contemplating new investments and against a backdrop of a transforming and increasingly interconnected industry, the Board also considers risk related to cybersecurity. Other significant risks overseen by the full Board include safety, New Mexico stakeholder relationships, and physical security.  
Preparing a Climate Change Report. The Board is well -advised as it continuously monitors the impacts of 
our operations on the environment. As part of these efforts, the Board considered the risks and opportunities related to climate change in requesting the preparation of the  Climate C hange Report  and approving PNM's 
strategy to transition to a cleaner energy portfolio, as well as PNM's and TNMP's investments to enhance their grids to support the expansion of renewable energy.  
Overseeing Other Risks. The Board also allocates responsibility for oversight of other risks and sustainability 
and corporate responsibility matters among the committees of the Board:  
• Our Nominating and Governance Committee  oversees our  Corporate Governance Principles , risks 
related to succession planning for the Board and non -employee director compensation.  
• Our Compensation and Human Re sources Committee  is responsible for establishing our executive 
compensation program, which aligns with our strategic goals and objectives and encourages our highly qualified executive team to operate our business in a sustainable manner. It also oversees succession planning risks for our executives and risks related to the compensation program. Our executive compensation programs are described in our  
annual proxy s tatements  filed with the SEC.  
32 
 • Our Audit and Ethics Committee  oversees our  Do the Right Thing: Principles of Business Conduct  and 
plays a central role in overseeing the integrity of our financial statements and reviewing and ap proving 
the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors. Itis regularly briefed on our 
North American Electric Reliability Corporation risks and risk mitigation programs.  
• Our Finance Committee  oversees our capital expenditures and financial health, including the capital 
programs supporting PNM's transformation to a cleaner energy portfolio and enhancements to PNM's and TNMP's grid. The Finance Committee also oversees the Company's management of risks associated with capital availability, liquidity and costs thereof; and monitors the execution of the Company's energy supply, sales, and hedging programs.  
Our Board has always demonstrated leadership on climate change matters. The Board  benefits from our 
directors’ extensive expertise regarding the Company's challenges and opportunities, including those related to climate change. Members of the Board and management team are actively involve d in multiple EPRI programs 
and serve on various Edison Electric Institute (EEI) committees focused on environmental risks and technological innovation to address these risks.  
The majority of our Board has  significant environmental and sustainability expertise relevant to our regulated 
electric utility businesses:  
• Patricia Collawn,  our Chairman, President and CEO, previously serve d as chairman of EPRI and  EEI. Ms. 
Collawn attended climate meetings in Paris and led the Company through the shutdown of two of the four coal- fired generation units at SJGS, which resulted in significant reductions in  carbon dioxide 
emissions. Additionally, under her leadership, the Company was one of the founding members of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership formed in 2006 and endorsed the 2009 Waxman -Markey climate change 
bill, aimed at significantly reducing CO
2 emissions and increasing renewable energy across the U.S.  
• Alan Fohrer  is a former chairman and CEO of Southern California Edison while it was a leader in both 
renewable energy purchases and energy efficiency. He also has co -chaired EEI's energy delivery and 
reliability committees and served on the boards of directors of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations.  
• E. Renae  Conley 's CEO experience at an energy consulting firm and directorships and executive officer 
positions at public energy companies.  
• Sidney Gutierrez  served as director of Environmental, Safety and Health Programs of Sandia National 
Laboratories.  
• Maureen Mullarkey  served as a director of another public energy company and served as an 
Entrepreneur in Residence with the Nevada Institute for Renewable En ergy Commercialization.  
• Vicky Bailey has over thirty years of high level, national and international experience in energy and 
regulated industries, including as a current director of two public energy companies. She also serves as a director of Battelle Memorial Institute, a non -profit applied science and technology organization that 
manages several of the National labs across the country for the United States Department of Energy.  
• James Hughes  has extensive experience in the energy industry, particularly w ith respect to the 
renewable energy sector. He is CEO and managing director of an energy storage company and is the former CEO and director of a solar company and a private company that owned and operated power distribution, power generation and natural ga s transportation and distribution businesses.  
We continually evaluate whether our governance processes are appropriate and effective in promoting holistic and long- term approaches to managing environmental, social and governance matters. We also ensure our 
disclosures on this topic are transparent and helpful to our stakeholders. As part of these efforts, we are 
33 
 evaluating different disclosure frameworks, including the framework created by the Task Force on Climate -
Related Financial Disclosures and a framew ork created by EEI. The Company is also participating in an EPRI 
project that is evaluating potential climate change policy scenario analysis and greenhouse gas goal setting.  
Cybersecurity  
PNM Resources believes that cybersecurity, like safety, is everyone’s responsibility. We are committed to a S3R3 
cybersecurity philosophy , which exemplifies that only by simplifying and standardizing our systems and services 
are we able to secure them, and only by ensuring their redundancy and resilience, can we provide a  reliable 
electric supply. In order to actualize our philosophy, we maintain a robust, enterprise -wide, risk -based security 
program, informed by the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework for 
Protecting Critical Infrast ructure. To protect our most critical systems, we also comply with the North American 
Electric Reliability Corporation’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards.  PNM Resources regularly assesses 
our vulnerability to cyber- attack by employing third par ty audits, penetration tests, and internal process 
assessments to continuously improve our internal cyber and data privacy controls. We partner with government 
and industry peers in a number of cybersecurity programs to share information and provide mutual assistance in 
the event of a cyber -attack.  We assess the risk of third -party suppliers as part of our procurement process and 
incorporate cybersecurity controls in all supplier contracts. PNM Resources remains focused on increasing 
cybersecurity awareness  and continues to implement additional technologies to enhance our cybersecurity 
capabilities.  
Public  Policy  
The Company  believes  that public  policy  decisions  shape  the direction  of our government  and impact  the 
environment  in which  we do business  and the quality  of life for all. Engaging in an open  and transparent  political 
process  is an important  principle  of the Company.  Accordingly,  the Company  encourages  its employees  and 
stakeholders  to participate  in the political and public  policy  making  processes.  We support  and strictly  comply  
with  all applicable  federal,  state,  and local laws  governing our political activitie s. 
Employee  Political  Participation   
Employees  at all levels  are encouraged  to participate  in the political process  and fully  exercise  their  rights.  
Consequently,  the Company  generally  will not promulgate  policies  that restrict  any appropriate,  lawful 
participation.  However,  campaign  contributions  to candidates  seeking  election  to the NMPRC  must  be given  
special consideration  given  the NMPRC's  role as a regulator of the rates  and services  of PNM.  Therefore,  
Company  officers  should  refrain  from  contributing to NMPRC  candidates  or their  campaign  committees.  Laws  
and regulations  governing political activities  and contributions  are complex,  and employees  are prohibited  from  
acting  on behalf of PNM  Resources  or in any way giving  the impression  that their  own  opinions  represent those  
of the Company  unless  they  are expressly  authorized  to do so. PNM  Resources  supports  and encourages  eligible  
employees  to participate  in the PNM  Resources Responsible  Citizens  Group  (RCG),  an employee -funded  political 
action  committee (PAC)  governed  by its own  board  of trustees.   34 
 Corporate  Political  Participation   
Federal laws  govern  how  a corporation  may  participate  in the political process.  On a limited  basis  and with  the 
approval of the senior  government  affairs  officer,  PNM  Resources  may  use corporate  funds  to make  
contributions  to 527 organizations  (tax- exempt organizations  that engage  in political activities),  trade  
associations  and for independent  expenditures.  PNM  Resources  also makes  contributions  to 501(c)(4)  
organizations  whose  primary  purpose  is to promote  social welfare.  PNM  Resources  generally  supports  public  
policies  that further the Company's  business  objectives;  promote  a diverse  mix of resources  for providing 
electricity  to our customers;  and support  investments  in the infrastructure  needed  to ensure  safe,  
environmentally  responsible,  reliab le, and cost- effective service  for our customers.   
The Company's  decisions  on spending corporate  funds  are based  on what  is in the best  interests  of the Company  
and what  we believe is sound  public  policy,  and not on the personal  preferences  of Company  officers,  directors  
or employees.  We also engage  in important  state and federal issues through  trade  associations  that represent  a 
broad  array  of professional  and industry  interests.  Depending on their  roles,  these  organizations  may  be subject  
to lobbyist  registration  and disclosure  reporting  obligations,  with  their  reports  made  available  to the public  by 
the federal and state agencies  overseeing  lobbying activities.  If a trade  association  to which  the Company  has 
contributed  informs  the Company  that a portion  of annual  dues  was used  for lobbying,  the Company  discloses  
the name  of the trade  association  and the dollar amount  used  for lobbying in its Annual  Report  of Contributions  
(below),  provided  that the amount  is $1,000 or more.  Additionally,  we are active  in local chambers  of commerce  
because  the Company  actively  supports  the economic  vitality  of the areas  we serve.  PNM  Resources'  policies  
require  that representatives  of the Company  file all political compliance  reports  required  by the Federal  
Elections  Commission  and state election  compliance  offices  in a complete  and timely  manner.   
Responsible  Citizens  Group  (RCG)   
PNM  Resources  supports  the RCG.  As permitted  by law, the Company  may  match  employee contributions  with  
donations  to qualifying  charities  to encourage  employee  membership  and participation  in the RCG.  While  the 
Company  is not permitted  to make  contributions  to the RCG,  the law does  permit  the Company  to fund  certain  
RCG administrative  expenses  such  as the cost of sending periodic  newsletters  and conducting the annual  
meeting.   
Independent  Expenditures   
PNM  Resources  may  make  independent  expenditures  from  its own  funds  or contribute  to a separate  registered  
PAC that engages  in independent  expenditures  concerning specific  candidates,  initiatives  or referenda  to the 
extent  permitted  by law. All such  expenditures  are reported  annually  to the Audit  and Ethics  Committee of the 
Company's  Board  of Directors.  PNM  Resources  provides  support  for New  Mexicans  for Progress,  a PAC to 
educate  the public  on public  policy  that advances  the creation  of jobs,  infrastructure  and economic 
development.   
Lobbying   
PNM  Resources  actively  participates  in the political  process  to help  shape  policies  that support  our efforts  to 
effectively  and responsibly  serve  our customers,  advance  our business  strategies  and goals,  promote  effective 
public  and government  relations,  and serve  the interests  of key stakeholder  groups.  By engaging with  elected  35 
 officials,  community  and business  leaders,  and state  agencies,  among  others,  we strive  to conduct  our business  
as transparently  as possible  to build  trust  and develop  lasting  partnerships  that promote  growth  and innovation  
within  our communities.  PNM  Resources  engages  registered  lobbyists,  both  federal and state,  to support  its 
legislative  and regulatory  activities.  These lobbyists  are carefully  selected  and are engaged only  with  the 
approval of senior  management  responsible  for government  affairs  oversight.  Company  employees  whose  main  
job is to lobby  at the federal,  state  and local  government  levels  are not permitted  to make  personal  
contributions  to candidates  for state  and local  offices  in New  Mexico  and Texas.  These employees  and other  
interested  eligible  employees  are provided  the opportunity  to participate  in the RCG,  where  the board  of 
trustees  oversees  the distribution  of campaign  contributions.   
Trade  Association s 
PNM  Resources  works  with  trade  associations  in its government  relations  activities.  Depending on their  capacity  
and function,  some  trade  associations  may  be subject  to lobbyist  disclosure  reporting  obligations,  with  their  
reports  made  available  to the public  by the federal and state  agencies  overseeing  lobbying activities.  For the 
trade  associations  where  PNM  Resources  has contributed  $1,000  or more,  and the organization  informs  the 
Company  a portion  of annual  dues  was used  for lobbying,  PNM  Resources  discloses  the name  of the trade  
association  and the dollar amount  used  for lobbying in its Annual  Report  of Contributions.   
PNM  Resources'  Corporate  Political  Contributions   
As part of our continued  commitment  to an open  and transparent  political process,  we are pleased  to provide  a 
voluntary  report  of corporate  contributions  made  to 527 organizations.  Below,  we report  the lobbying portion  of 
payments  and dues  to trade  associations  that,  if made  directly  by PNM  Resources,  would  not be deductible  
under  section  162(e)  of the Internal  Revenue Code.  The report  on the lobbying portion  of payments  and dues  is 
based  upon  information  provided  by the trade  associations.

small and diverse  business es in the

have  registered  with  us in categories  that might  be aligned  with  suitable  activities  so that they  can be considered  
for appropriate  opportunities.   
In addition,  we capture  our spend  with  small  and disadvantaged  businesses  so that we have  an indication  of our 
activities  in supporting those  companies  with  lesser  footprints  and leverage.
