Message from our CEO
As we write this year’s sustainability report, there are 
several things weighing heavy on the minds of all of 
us, myself included.  First is how Alaska continues to 
push ourselves to run our business in a sustainable way, 
where we lift up people and communities as we move 
forward.  This includes climate change, and though this 
subject has been receiving less attention in the last four 
months, it is still critically important to the livelihoods of 
future generations.  Second is the coronavirus and its 
profound impact on public health and on our economic 
livelihoods.  And third, and perhaps most important, are 
the racial attacks on Black Americans and our country’s 
awakening to what we must do to correct hundreds of 
years of injustice and inequity.
Delving more into COVID-19, this virus has caused 
severe reductions in travel, and we believe that demand 
will be suppressed for a sustained period of time.  
Flying will be different in the future.  At Alaska, we are 
working to match our commitment to industry-leading 
safety in flight with an increased focus on the personal 
health and safety of our employees and guests.  We 
are also grappling with how to keep our economic 
engine running through this difficult time, so that we 
can provide good jobs and sustain livelihoods.  We’re 
committed to supporting those around us through 
these challenges, by donating food to battle rising rates 
of food insecurity, by donating time to read to and tutor young people who are learning remotely, and 
by donating space on our aircraft to carry health care 
workers and medical supplies. 
On the subject of racial injustice and racial inequity, 
I simply want to say that I believe the vast majority 
of us know that what is happening today is wrong, 
and that we must be better than this.  We do not 
believe it is the responsibility of Black Americans and 
other communities of color to correct the conditions 
that have brought us to where we are today.  That 
responsibility lies with all of us.  At Alaska, we’ve always 
believed that the best way to make lasting change is 
to subject problems and challenges to sunlight.  And 
this report will help us do that.  There is so much 
more to be done on this subject, and the level of 
change we need in our country will require sustained 
and substantial effort by businesses, governments 
and individuals.  To see some of our early thinking on 
the subject, please see one of our internal employee 
communications (which we posted on our blog) here.
Thank you for reading this report, thank you for being 
a part of our journey, and thank you for believing in 
Alaska and pushing us to have the greatest impact 
possible on the world in which we live. 
Sincerely, 
Brad Tilden
Report introduction      Message from our CEO5
 5 Report introduction      2019 Executive Summary 
I miss flying – and especially the perspective it brings. 
It’s a privilege, seeing the w orld from 32, 000 feet – 
farmlands, mountains, or on a clear night the tiny strings 
of lights connecting cities and towns. It always reminds 
me how diverse our world is and yet how much we have 
in common.
In the world around us we’re gr appling with a pandemic, 
with economic recession, systemic racism, and climate 
change. At Alaska Airlines, we’r e grappling with these 
issues as well as how to support as many emplo yees 
and jobs as possible while we re-size and re-se t to come 
through an unpreceden ted time.
Across these challenges, the imperative is to take action 
that drives sustainable positive change for those around 
us. This need is not new. Alaska Airlines roots are in 
connecting rur al Alask an villages with essential services 
like food, medical supplies, and mail delivery – and those 
values ar e with us today. We know there is much work 
needed to literally sustain, to address our impact on the 
globe, to e xpand opportunity equitably , and to ensur e that 
all people are and truly feel safe, respected, and equal. Our commitments for the present challenge 
and the future
A few years ago, we began using the term “LIFT” for our 
long-time efforts around environmental and social impact, riffing on the physics principle at the root of aviation. So what does LIFT look like amidst a pandemic:  
•
 B
uilding on longstanding leadership in flight safety,
we’ve extended our safety efforts to include nearly
100 discrete actions to protect the personal healthand safety of our guests and employees, includingenhanced standards of aircraft cleaning andphysical distancing.
•
 W
e’ve transported critical cargo such as medication,
masks and other protective equipment to medicalfacilities and first responders. And in partnership withAngel Flight West, we’ve flown health care workers forfree when they’re #GoingtheExtraMile to serve wheremost needed.
•
 T
o address the challenge of food insecurity, we
launched the #MillionMealsChallenge to match onemillion meals worth of fresh and packaged food wedonated to local food banks with another millionsupported by our employees, partners, and guests.2019 Executive Summary, 
by Diana Birkett Rakow2020 is an important moment for our sustainability work. This 
year, to increase transparency, we are reporting according to Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) guidelines including deeper commentary on safety and climate. And in the next year, we will roll out a new set of five-year objectives, including goals to address our impact across carbon, waste, and water. 
Our greatest material impact is the carbon generated through 
burning fuel in our operation, and we know that this has an impact on the climate. In 2019, flying our guests accounted for eight million tons of carbon emissions, the same as operating two coal power plants. We’ve learned from the coronavirus pandemic that our collective actions have impacts around the globe and that they can change a trend.
US airlines currently account for more than 2% of the nation’s 
greenhouse gas emissions. But as other sectors electrify, airlines’ share is growing. We will tackle our contribution to this trend by:
•
 B
eing as fuel-efficient as possible – from aircraft
technology, weight, flight patterns, ground and air
procedures, and more;
•
 U
sing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) safely and effectively,
and working with others to make SAF a more accessibleand viable option where we fly;
•
 In
vesting in carbon capture and offset projects, planting
trees along riverbanks to protect salmon habitat and coolriver water and supporting the ecosystem around us.VP of External Relations, Alaska Airlines6
Our 2019 Performance 
This work doesn’t happen without taking stock of where 
we are, where we made progress and where we fell short. 
As we enter the final year of reporting on our 2020 goals, 
we are proud of progress in fuel efficiency and emissions, 
waste diversion, gender equity and advancing education and 
economic opportunity. And we faced some hurdles stemming 
from integrating our workforce and dual fleet. 
Safety: 
•  We reached our goal of decreasing medium risk safety 
events by 30% over 2017, and surpassed goal by increasing 
safety reporting 45% as part of our ongoing safety program.
Employee engagement & equity: 
•  We did not achieve our target employee engagement 
score and continued to feel the impact of our acquisition 
and integration of Virgin America. In 2019 we achieved 
integration of all labor contracts and work groups, a critical 
milestone to support employee engagement as one team. 
•  We achieved goals of being recognized as a Forbes’ Great 
Place to Work and integrating diversity & inclusion initiatives 
into the strategies of our four largest work groups.
• T o actively advance the diversity of our workforce, we 
signed a commitment to Sisters of the Skies aimed at 
increasing the number of Black women pilots over the next 
six years and supporting the path to expose and inspire 
more young women to get there.•  And we achieved gender parity among independent 
Directors on our Board, the first West Coast Fortune 500 
company to achieve this. 
Emissions:
•  We continue to improve our fuel efficiency, with 16% 
reduction in emissions over 2012 including through 
innovations like split scimitar winglets and navigation 
technologies.
•  Alaska is one of the most fuel-efficient airlines in the 
world according to the International Council on Clean 
Transportation and has ranked as the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index leading US airline for  
three years. 
Waste management and diversion:
•  Leading the industry with our employee-driven recycling 
program, last year our flight attendants helped to recycle 
nearly 2000 tons of cans, cups, paper and other materials. 
But our progress flattened as we integrated our flight 
attendant workgroup across Boeing and Airbus aircraft – a 
final step in integration from our 2016 acquisition of Virgin 
America – and introduced the recycling program previously 
operated successfully on our Boeing aircraft to our full fleet. 
•  This year we also reached our 2020 goal to reduce paper 
consumption by 50% per departure over 2012.
•  The initiative we launched in 2018 to go #Strawless has 
eliminated use of 23 million plastic straws and stir sticks 
which cannot be recycled.Report introduction      2019 Executive Summary 
7
•  We launched the #FillBeforeYouFly campaign with our 
partner MiiR, to encourage guests and employees to 
bring their own water bottles and help reduce single-use 
plastics. We started by eliminating plastic water bottles 
from our corporate office. 
Economic and educational outcomes: 
•  Since 2014, we’ve supported over 107,000 young people 
and aviation workers with education and workforce 
development opportunities and surpassed our goal 
of serving over 100,000 by the end of 2020. In 2019, 
nearly 20,000 young people and workers participated in 
Alaska-driven programs such as Aviation Day and Airport 
University designed to provide pathways into highly 
skilled careers. 
•  Our employees volunteered 41,000 hours in 2019, 
including preparing meals in Honolulu, cleaning and 
painting homes for homeless youth and families in Seattle, 
San Francisco and Anchorage, cleaning coastlines in the 
Bay Area and green spaces in Portland, and mentoring 
students in New York. Recommitting to tackle complex challenges for good:
I am often humbled by the amount of work yet to do to 
protect and grow our positive impact and reduce our 
detrimental ones. But I know that sense has been shared at 
key moments in history as well. 
My grandmother Eleanor, namesake for my 3-year old, 
passed away a few years ago at the age of 104.  She had a 
sense of humor and only wore heels – and more relevantly 
here, grew up in midst of the Spanish Flu pandemic.  Her 
generation experienced incredible challenge, from World 
Wars to the Great Depression, polio, suffrage, segregation, 
and our prior civil rights movement. She also witnessed 
a country that bounced back, time after time, and always 
brought that perspective. In her lifetime she experienced an 
incredible transformation of technology, culture, and global 
connectivity. And she always reminded me to believe in our 
collective ability to positive change. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us how closely we 
are connected, and that while we are vulnerable to large 
global challenges, collective action can drive change. Now 
is a moment to recommit to true progress in equity and the 
economic and climate challenges we face today.  Let’s keep 
taking off.

SASB Climate Narrative
Management and Governance of  
Climate-Related Issues:
Our Sustainability / ESG team uses multiple avenues 
to identify and evaluate climate risks, including input 
from investors, input from policy / government, input 
from NGOs and reporting frameworks, our trade 
associations, and input from key stakeholders within 
and outside of the aviation industry.
Our Executive Committee of senior management 
began in the last year to engage in education on 
sustainability issues and supports increasing this 
education to include all our employees. Climate risks 
and opportunities factor into key business decisions, 
such as fleet decisions and fuel efficiency.
Board Governance:
The Nomination / Governance committee of our 
Board reviews our ESG / sustainability performance 
quarterly, including our performance on enterprise-
wide publicly reported sustainability goals, and 
climate-related issues.  Other board committees 
receive relevant updates on issues such as CORSIA, 
and climate risks that may elevate through our 
enterprise risk management program.  Alaska’s 
enterprise-wide risk analysis and oversight program is designed to identify the various risks faced by the 
organization, assign responsibility for managing those 
risks to individual executives as well as align these 
risks with Board oversight.
Climate Strategy:
Alaska’s most material sustainability priority is 
reducing our carbon emissions from jet fuel.  Jet 
fuel is over 99% of our direct climate footprint and 
represents our second largest expense as a company.  
Because of this direct tie to expenses and Alaska’s 
management focus on low costs to enable low fares, 
Alaska has had a multi-decade focus on increasing 
the fuel efficiency of our fleet (“what we fly”) and 
on developing and deploying new technologies to 
optimize our routes and minimizing fuel use in our 
taxing and using preconditioned air at our gates 
(“how we fly”).  In addition, Alaska has a decade of 
leadership in piloting and pioneering low-carbon 
sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), directly supporting 
the development and deployment of the SAF market 
in partnership with many key organizations (“the fuel 
we use”).   
Alaska Airlines begin setting and tracking progress 
to a voluntary climate goal a decade ago, and our 
current climate goal is to reduce our aircraft carbon emissions by 17% per revenue-ton mile (RTM) in 
2020, from our 2009 baseline.  Our current metric is 
intensity based, due to the direct connection between 
business growth and use of jet fuel.   19
In addition, as a member of the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) and Airlines for America (A4A), we are 
working alongside other airlines to address the challenge 
of climate change. We have adopted a set of global 
targets to mitigate CO2 emissions from air transport, and 
are working to meet these goals through:
1.  Improved technology, including the deployment and 
more local availability and manufacturing of sustainable 
low-carbon fuels 
2.  More efficient aircraft operations 
3.  Infrastructure improvements, including modernized air 
traffic management systems 
4.  A single global market-based measure to fill the 
remaining emissions gap on international routes 
(CORSIA).
Transparency and Disclosure:
We annually report our greenhouse gas impact in our 
LIFT Report, as well as submitting our climate metrics to 
the CDP.  For CORSIA, we have submitted our baseline 
calculation and are assessing efficiency and offset options.
Our Climate Investments
What we Fly:
In 2017 we finalized installation of split scimitar winglets 
on all our eligible 737 aircraft, improving average fuel 
efficiency by over 34,000 gallons per aircraft each year. 
Aircraft fitted with split scimitar winglets are roughly 4.5% 
more fuel efficient than those without winglets. In 2018, the scimitar winglets modification saved approximately 4.5 
million gallons of fuel. Our Boeing fleet is now 100% “NG” 
(Next Generation), supporting a high-level of efficiency. In 
our Airbus fleet, we took delivery of our first four A321neo 
aircraft in 2017, followed by four more in 2018. Equipped 
with ultra-efficient CFM LEAP-1A engines, the aircraft flies 
102 seat miles per gallon—compared to the A319, which 
gets 65 seat miles per gallon.  We continue to invest in 
improvements that save fuel, such as reducing the weight 
of the interiors on our Airbus aircraft, and will continue to 
use efficiency as a lens in future fleet decisions.
How we fly: 
We continued our use of RNP approaches and departures. 
Required Navigation Performance (RNP) is a performance-
based navigation technique that uses a combination of 
onboard navigation technology and the GPS satellite 
network to fly safer, more reliable approaches. For years, 
we’ve advocated to expand the use of RNP technologies 
to airports across the country and to enable broader 
air traffic infrastructure to support that goal. RNP 
technologies save an estimated 1.2 million gallons of fuel 
annually due to reduced track miles. We also continued 
our Arrival Fuel Program that encourages smart choices 
that optimize the use of fuel when planning and selecting 
alternate landing sites. Through this, we save an estimated 
300,000 gallons of fuel annually. Alaska is also partnering 
with NASA, as the sole airline to use new technology to 
optimize flight paths in real time. This technology, known 
as Traffic Aware Planner, is estimated to be able to save 
between 8,000 and 12,000 gallons of fuel per aircraft 
each year.The fuel we use: 
We continue to build strong partnerships with industry 
leaders in the sustainable aviation fuels arena. We 
are working with the airports, other industry leaders, 
local and state government representatives, and major 
producers to develop the strategy for a sustainable fuels 
path for SeaTac, San Francisco and other airports on the 
West Coast. We have memorandums of understanding 
with the Port of Seattle, San Francisco airport, and 
Neste—a renewable fuels company that is pioneering 
sustainable aviation fuel – and have supported public 
policy proposals that would support the development 
of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Procuring SAF that is 
priced competitively with traditional fuel has been difficult. 
We are searching for the best ways to obtain the volume 
of fuel that we need at the right price. In the meantime, we 
continue to make progress by partnering with alternative 
fuel companies, stakeholder groups, and industry steering 
committees to accelerate innovation.
Additional efforts:
We look beyond our impact of jet fuel and pursue other 
greenhouse gas emissions reductions in other aspects 
of our aviation operations, as well as in other areas of 
our corporate footprint.  For example, we partner with 
airports on the adoption and growth of the use of electric 
ground-service equipment and other efforts that require 
collaborative effort.  In addition, we pursue green building 
and energy efficiency in our building footprint including 
LEED certification for new buildings and retrofitting 
existing buildings with more energy-efficient lighting 
and technology. Appendix             20
Alaska Air Group Safety Narrative for SASB (Draft):
Safety is the foundation of everything we do and remains 
our top priority.  We have an unwavering commitment 
to run a safe operation, and we will not compromise this 
commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives.  Alaska and 
Horizon were the first U.S. major airlines to receive FAA 
validation and acceptance of their Safety Management 
System (SMS) in 2016, and we are at the continuous 
improvement level.  
In 2018, we used SMS to safely and consistently guide 
our integration with the legacy Virgin America operation.  
Report It!, our mobile safety reporting application, makes it 
easier for employees to file safety reports.  Alaska has been 
on the IOSA registration audit since 2005.  In 2018, 100% 
of our Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians completed 
this requirement for the FAA’s “Diamond Certificate of 
Excellence” award, marking the 17th consecutive year 
Alaska has received the award, and the 17th time in the last 
19 years Horizon has received this award.  In early 2020, 
we were again included as one of only two US airlines on 
the AirlineRatings.com list of the world’s Top 20 safest 
airlines.  
We believe that maintaining safe operations, through 
adherence to well-defined processes and ensuring 
every Air Group employee is aware of their individual 
contribution to our operation, is critical to on-time 
performance.  The rigor we apply to running a safe operation has resulted in Alaska consistently being one of 
the top airlines in North America for on-time performance; 
and Horizon was recognized again as the leader in on-time 
performance among regional airlines.
Management and Governance of Safety:
Our Safety Management System (SMS) utilizes multiple 
levels of performance review in all areas of the company 
to create visibility to hazards, safety risk, and ensure 
management accountability with mitigation controls and 
corrective action plans. The SMS uses multiple safety 
assurance systems to identify hazards and continuously 
evaluate the control environment to ensure the highest 
margins for repeatable safety performance. 
Our Executive Committee of senior management review 
safety quarterly with our VP of Safety and Security.  Our 
Executive Safety Review Board also occurs quarterly, 
attended by all of operational VPs and COO.  These 
meetings are intended to analyze safety performance 
and to discuss continued improve our safety culture and 
process. Safety risks and opportunities factor into key 
business decisions. 
The Safety committee of the Alaska Air Group (AAG) 
Board reviews our safety performance quarterly, including 
our performance on enterprise-wide safety goals.  Alaska’s 
enterprise-wide risk analysis and oversight program 
is designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization, assign responsibility for managing those risks 
to individual executives as well as align these risks with 
Board oversight. 
Goals:
Increase employee safety reporting by 26% over 2017 
baseline (reports per employee) and decrease medium risk 
(3+) safety events by 20%.  We had 7 medium safety risk 
events in 2019: a reduction of 42% compared to 2017, and 
employee safety reporting is well past our goal and is up 
45% over our 2017 baseline.  AAG performed 1761 safety 
risk assessments in 2019 and identified 1730 hazards.  
Out of the 1730 hazards identified, 84% of the hazards 
required mitigation.
1.   Cross-carrier collaboration on flight operations, cabin 
operations, ground operations, and maintenance risk 
mitigation procedures 
2.  Ensuring active flight data monitoring and reporting 
systems of airline operations 
3. Reducing injuries through improved procedures,  
 training, and technology 
4.  Reducing aircraft ground damage through innovative 
ground service equipment technology, procedures, and 
training
5.  Data sharing of safety risks across safety management 
systemsSASB Safety NarrativeAppendix             21
