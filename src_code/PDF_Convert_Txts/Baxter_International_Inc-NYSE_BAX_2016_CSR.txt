Introduction
From the Chairman and CEO
Baxter’s mission, “Save and Sustain Lives,” is a mere 
four words, yet rich with meaning for our 48,000 employees worldwide. 
It channels our passion as we address fundamental 
healthcare needs of patients and their clinicians worldwide; and it guides the choices we make in the service of sound corporate citizenship. Baxter employees are tenacious in pursuing lasting social, environmental and economic value for our stakeholders consistent with our mission.
2016 was a transformational year for our company. 
It was our first full year of operation following the spinoff of our bioscience business, which served as a catalyst to redefine our strategy and elevate our 
performance as a healthcare leader. It also presented an opportunity to assert our commitment to corporate responsibility in some new ways to make an even greater impact for our diverse stakeholder base. In 2016:
•
 T
he Baxter International Foundation, our philanthropic arm, made the largest single grant in its history—$2.25 
million over three years—to fund an innovative mobile care program designed to increase healthcare access 
among underserved populations in Mexico City
•
 W
e completed the first year of our new “manufacture to donate” process, addressing urgent care needs in 67 
countries with approximately $14 million in products distributed through our relief partners
•
 W
e significantly bolstered our global emphasis on workplace flexibility, providing new tools and information to 
support our employees
•
 W
e achieved our best safety performance ever, with recordable cases decreasing 19% from the previous year
Examples like these begin to reflect the wide-ranging scope of our dedication. Even as we transform as a 
business, we are tireless in our efforts to expand access to quality care, reduce our environmental footprint, advance STEM education, promote an inclusive workplace, and ultimately make a difference for the communities and constituencies we serve. You will see many highlights in this report.
Our corporate responsibility priorities are tightly integrated with our strategic imperatives as a healthcare leader, 
adding greater dimension to how we bring our mission to life. And just as there will always be unmet needs to address on behalf of patients, there will always be new avenues to pursue on our journey as a corporate citizen. Many are outlined in our 2020 corporate responsibility goals, while others will be defined only as tomorrow’s challenges come to light. 
Through it all, what remains certain is the remarkable energy and focus our employees bring to all facets of our 
mission. Together we will continue working hard to advance care and touch lives around the world.
José (Joe) E. Almeida   |   Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Product Innovation
Improve sustainability and 
performance of products  
and services 
Baxter creates products that save and sustain lives 
worldwide. This is the company’s mission and its most important contribution to society. The demand for Baxter’s products will only continue to grow as the world pushes toward 9.7 billion people by 2050
1 and standards of living continue to improve 
globally. Quality and patient safety underpin the company’s ongoing success. Baxter has extensive policies and processes to ensure excellence in these areas, and continues to innovate new products and services that enhance patient safety. 
Manufacturing and delivering products can 
have extensive environmental impacts. These impacts are mainly due to the materials Baxter’s products contain and the energy, water and other resources needed to make, transport and use them. To capture the most value from these natural resources, the company is continuing to shift from a linear model of “take, make, dispose” to a circular 
model illustrated in the graphic below. Innovative product, service and systems design, increased reuse and recycling, and collaboration across sectors enable product materials to remain in use longer. This approach can save Baxter money, improve its reputation, and reduce the company’s environmental impact and that of its customers.
Bureau Veritas has provided assurance  on the c ontent 
in this section (except the Quality and Patient Safety 
subsection).SUSTAINABILITY ACROSS THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE

QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY
Baxter’s reputation and ongoing success depend 
on the quality and safety of its products and services. A focus on quality is embedded in Baxter’s culture across the product life cycle, from product development and enhancements to post-market surveillance activities.
In 2016, Baxter established Top 20 Complaint 
Reduction, a comprehensive program to enhance product performance and safety. This program helped the company decrease product complaint incidents by 22%, exceeding the goal of a 15% reduction by 2020. Continuing to improve in these areas will free up resources to focus on innovation and new technologies.
Key examples of innovations in 2016 that enhanced 
product quality and usability include: 
•
 MiniCaps, a disposable pr
oduct that supports 
peritoneal dialysis (PD), enables users to safely connect to and disconnect from the PD system 
aseptically, significantly reducing the risk of peritonitis. Baxter’s Quality and Engineering teams implemented a multitiered approach to reduce process variability and improve inspection capabilities. This enhanced product performance significantly in 2016 and 2017, decreasing both complaints and medical device reports by more than 50%.
•
 A
ccess Disposables products are used to transfer 
therapeutic fluids, medications, and nutrition, blood and blood products from a rigid, semi-rigid or flexible container to the hub of an access device. Changing catheter extension set materials from acrylic to ABS plastic virtually eliminated connection complaints for the product.
Baxter also introduced several new products in the 
hospital products and renal markets to continually improve the customer experience. For example, the Renal franchise launched CLARIA, AMIA, and SHARESOURCE in 2016 to improve PD treatment. CLARIA is the newest version of the popular HOMECHOICE device, with improved technology. The AMIA device provides additional customer interface innovations to ease new patients onto PD therapy and assist with home use. In conjunction with the SHARESOURCE telehealth system, these products provide the first and only two-way, remote patient management system for home dialysis therapy globally (see case study at left).
The company also collaborates with regulatory bodies to advance quality and safety.
2 Baxter is 
working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to develop standards and metrics that will enable the agency to more effectively compare companies and identify leaders in quality and safety. The FDA will then use this information to determine the frequency of inspections. Baxter will be among the first sites to participate in the pilot 22%48%6%46%

SHARESOURCE Remote  
Patient Automated Peritoneal 
Dialysis Management System
In 2016, Baxter launched its SHARESOURCE 
remote patient management system, designed to help more patients gain access to home therapy. This telehealth platform is offered with Baxter’s AMIA and HOMECHOICE CLARIA automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) systems, where they are cleared for use worldwide. The two-way, cloud-based technology platform improves the patient experience by allowing designated healthcare providers to securely view dialysis-related treatment data that are automatically collected after each home-based PD session. Healthcare providers can act on this information by securely and remotely adjusting their patients’ device settings without requiring patients to travel to the clinic. The SHARESOURCE system also provides a patient’s healthcare team better visibility to his or her missed treatments, for follow-up as needed.
These are in addition to the more general 
benefits of home-based PD therapy, including 
receiving treatment in a familiar setting, avoiding 
the need to travel to clinics, and maintaining the ability to work during normal business hours. This treatment also offers environmental advantages, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions related to travel and decreased use of electricity and water for treatment compared to in-clinic hemodialysis. AMIA also reduces materials use, since it is up to 40% smaller and 30% lighter than other systems on the market.Product

studies, which will allow it to further demonstrate 
the capabilities of its quality system. The company is also working with ministries of health in China, 
Thailand and Mexico to help shape standards 
related to parametric release, a method of ensuring that critical parameters are met for sterility at the time of product release.
To achieve its vision to be a top quartile company, 
Baxter is also collaborating with suppliers and contract manufacturers to increase their capabilities and support ongoing improvements and innovation in the company’s product portfolio.
SUSTAINABLE DESIGN
Baxter’s Product Sustainability Program—in partnership with the research and development, marketing and supply chain groups—embeds product stewardship across the company.
Product Sustainability Review (PSR) underpins 
the company’s sustainable design efforts. This required assessment, or a similar analysis, occurs during the product development process for all new products, to assess environmental, health and safety, sustainability, and regulatory considerations and requirements across the value chain. This includes high-level review as well as more detailed life cycle assessment (LCA)-based computer modeling of proposed products and may involve comparison with existing products. Key metrics illustrate progress on avoiding materials of concern, minimizing customer waste and reducing product carbon footprint. The objectives of PSR are to continually improve Baxter’s own operations, help meet customer expectations to make products more sustainable and manage regulatory risk.Since 2005, Baxter has used PSR to evaluate 
more than 20 medical devices, and currently has multiple products under assessment. Several PSR reviews have influenced materials selection to avoid chemicals of concern. This is in addition to more than 80 renal products that have undergone a separate environmental impact analysis. Eighty-four percent of those products demonstrated either improved or comparable performance with the products they replaced.
To supplement PSR, Baxter uses LCA in selected cases to evaluate and improve the sustainability performance of its products. During 2016, the company expanded on an LCA conducted the prior year on Baxter Renal Therapy Services (RTS)
3 in Colombia. Baxter collaborated with the 
University of Wisconsin–Madison to conduct a social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) to develop a broader understanding of the social implications and relative benefits of in-clinic hemodialysis and home-based peritoneal dialysis in that country, from the perspectives of various stakeholder groups. This pioneering study helped to advance emerging S-LCA methodology and illustrated how this approach may be applied to healthcare services. 
During 2016, Baxter piloted a project to assess the 
social, environmental and economic value created for patients and hospitals through the use of several key products in Latin America, due to factors such as reduced length of stay in treatment facilities.  
During 2016, Baxter remained involved with the 
Coalition for Sustainable Pharmaceuticals  
and Medical Devices (CSPM), a working group of leading healthcar
e companies of which it 
was a founding member. Baxter will continue collaborating with the organization to understand customer needs and trends related to sustainable healthcare and to help drive the industry forward.MATERIALS USE
Materials use is a key driver of Baxter ’s environmental  
footprint, so getting the most value possible from 
materials is a priority and central to the company’s drive toward a more circular economy. Reducing plastic waste and increasing recycling is essential, since plastic scrap from manufacturing is the company’s largest waste stream. During 2016, Baxter reduced plastic scrap per unit of production by 5% compared to 2015, at 17 sites representing 73% of the company’s overall plastic volume. This decreased plastic waste by more than 535 metric tons. 
Baxter also innovates to decrease the environmental 
impact of product packaging by reducing the amount used and substituting for environmentally preferable materials. In 2016, the company’s facility in Cali, Colombia, changed the film type of the Mini-Bag Plus, improving performance and saving 31 metric tons of PVC and $62,000 on an annualized basis. By reducing the thickness of IV and renal fluid bags from 0.0145 inches to 0.0125 inches, the company’s São Paulo, Brazil, facility will save 145 metric tons of PVC and $400,000 yearly.

Baxter’s site in Guangzhou, China, reduced the 
size of MiniCap packaging, saving 15 metric tons of cardboard and nearly $110,000 annually.
Keeping materials of concern out of the waste 
stream can increase the value of waste and the potential for waste material to be reused for other high-value purposes. Baxter has global strategies and programs to help ensure that it meets product materials restrictions such as the EU RoHS2 Directive and the EU REACH Regulation, among others. The company also works to minimize or avoid the use of conflict minerals in its products and reports progress. In addition to materials restricted by regulations, Baxter also gathers information about substances such as bisphenol-A (BPA) and latex, which are of interest to some customers.
PRODUCT END-OF-LIFE
Baxter works to keep valuable materials in use at the end of product life. Some of the electronic medical devices Baxter sells, such as renal automated peritoneal dialysis cyclers, are designed to support the circular economy through serviceability, repair and reuse. The company leases certain types of its electronic medical products to customers and patients, which helps ensure that they have the technology that best meets their needs and provides increased flexibility compared to ownership. This model also ensures that those products will be returned to Baxter after a set period of time. As appropriate, the company repairs those products for reuse, which lengthens product life, decreases the environmental impacts of product disposal and new product manufacture, and keeps valuable materials in use. In Europe, Baxter conducted 12,000 service events of HOMECHOICE PD devices during 2016. Regulations in many countries worldwide require responsible recycling of electronic products when reuse is no longer an option. For example, the European Union (EU) Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires manufacturers to arrange for the take-back of electronic products at end-of-life. In 2016, more than 50 metric tons of electronic products and batteries were recovered in the region on Baxter’s behalf. Baxter’s WEEE website provides customers detailed information on how to dispose of Baxter products in accordance with the directive.
Baxter also works with customers, industry peers 
and recycling and disposal vendors to facilitate the recycling and responsible treatment of disposable medical products such as IV bags. During 2016, Baxter participated in a pilot project of the Healthcare Plastics Recycling Council (HPRC) and the Plastics Industry Association to demonstrate the viability of recycling noninfectious, pre-patient healthcare plastics on a regional basis. The study, which focused on the Chicago area, revealed information about the types and volumes of plastics used in participating hospitals, the possible economies of scale of multi-hospital efforts, challenges associated with sorting comingled plastics, and the potential for materials recycling. See the Chicago Regional Demonstration Project  
Report for more detail. 
Baxter co-founded a European chapter of HPRC with several other companies and sponsored a workshop in the UK in 2016 to explore how to apply circular economy principles to healthcare plastics in the European Union. The company has since helped to expand the reach of the chapter and implement some of the ideas discussed including partnering with a hospital in Denmark to understand its waste streams.   In 2013, Baxter established a partnership with the Vinyl Council of Australia (VCA) to launch the VCA’s PVC Recovery in Hospitals initiative in Australia. During 2016, the initiative expanded to reach 62 hospitals in Australia (up from 48 in 2015) as well as 28 in New Zealand (up from 12 in 2015). Together, these locations are estimated to collect about 10 metric tons of PVC for recycling per month. Baxter Australia added the collection of aluminium anesthesia containers to the program at three hospitals, and plans to expand to more in 2017. See historical information.
The company is also helping patients who receive 
regular home deliveries of dialysis solutions to recycle related waste. As of the end of 2016, more than 750 Baxter peritoneal dialysis (PD) home patients participated in the Home PD Recycling Program (643 in Australia and 107 in New Zealand, up from 460 and 0 the prior year). The program collects and recycles 9 metric tons of plastic and 7 metric tons of cardboard each month.+hospitals in

Performance and Career Development
To advance Baxter’s goal of being a Best Place to Work, in 2016 the company simplified its approach to performance management by eliminating ratings and increasing the emphasis on continuous feedback. In 2017, Baxter is moving to monthly check-ins focused on performance feedback, and enhanced career development and planning, for which all employees and managers have responsibility. To support this shift and to further build manager and employee capabilities, Baxter will offer a learning series in 2017 focused on receiving and giving feedback, career development and planning, and engagement. In 2016, the company piloted career development and planning webinars with more than 1,300 employees in its Global Science and Technology organization. 
In 2016, Baxter introduced 10 leadership 
competencies that align to the company’s cultural values. These guide performance, development planning, and employee selection; drive continuous improvement; and enhance monthly check-ins between employees and managers. With the launch of the leadership competencies, Baxter provided tools and resources to managers and employees to prioritize development and growth in these critical areas. These included a self-assessment tool to help employees and managers align on strengths and gaps, a guide to help employees develop in each competency and aligned e-learning modules.
Baxter also conducted a 360 degree assessment 
during the year—aligned with the leadership competencies—with the company’s top leaders. The assessments provided feedback to help the leadership team create development and succession plans. Baxter plans to cascade the 360 degree assessment process to additional levels of employees in 2017 and beyond.Product

Ethics and Compliance
Drive a culture of integrity  
and the highest ethical behavior
As a global healthcare company operating in 
more than 100 countries, Baxter incorporates ethics and compliance into everything that it does. The company’s success is based on personal accountability for results and integrity. Patients, doctors, customers, regulators, investors and employees count on it. Baxter and its employees prioritize being honest and fair, keeping promises, encouraging questions, valuing discussion and following legal requirements. 
LEGAL AND REGULATORY 
COMPLIANCE TRAINING
In November 2016, Baxter refreshed its Code 
of Conduct and all employees were required to complete a related training, either in person or via an online training module. As relevant to their jobs, Baxter employees also complete more than 20 e-learning courses each year covering topics such as adverse event reporting procedures, the company’s ethics and compliance standards, data privacy, Baxter’s Global Interactions Policy, trade compliance, and workplace violence prevention. Business and functional leaders also conducted hundreds of interactive in-person training sessions worldwide during the year about Baxter’s ethics and compliance standards and supporting policies.
THIRD PARTY PROGRAM
Baxter is committed to conducting business with integrity and in compliance with the law in all countries in which it does business. The company’s Third Party Program, policy and training outlines the standards against which, and the processes by which, new and existing third parties are reviewed, retained and monitored for compliance with the company’s anticorruption expectations. The program and policy apply to all Baxter employees, officers and directors involved in review, retention and monitoring of third parties. Through April 2017, nearly 5,000 Baxter employees were trained on the company’s Third Party Program.

Injuries and Major Incidents
Baxter regularly evaluates the company’s main 
sources of work-related injuries to identify trends and opportunities for improvement.
Major incidents are defined as those that result 
in an employee or contractor being hospitalized overnight (for more than observation), sustaining an amputation or dying. When a major incident occurs, facility management conducts an evaluation and follows formal processes and reporting mechanisms to share knowledge companywide and prevent recurrence.      
Major incidents increased at Baxter in 2016 (eight, none involving contractors) compared to 2015 (four, none involving contractors). No fatalities occurred.
Enhancing Safety Culture and 
Performance
In 2016, based on a review of historical 
performance trends, Baxter further enhanced its safety culture and performance. This includes specific safety strategies for targeted facilities, increased oversight of case reporting, and completion of corrective and preventive actions following recordable injuries.  
FOCUSED INJURY AND ILLNESS REDUCTION 
STRATEGIES
Injury and illness metrics and internal EHS&S 
audits provide focus for the company’s safety, occupational health and industrial hygiene efforts. Baxter continues to target ergonomics and slips, trips and falls, the primary sources of injury within the company.EMPHASIS ON HIGH-HAZARD SOURCES
During 2016, Baxter continued to categorize all EHS&S incidents by potential severity, and devoted appropriate resources to discover the root causes of incidents, correct them and prevent recurrence. Baxter launched a new Safety Alert system to enhance learning from major incidents. The system requires applicable sites to verify awareness of occurrences and associated risks, as well as any needed remediation. 
Health and Wellness Program 
Management and Initiatives
Baxter ’s occupational health function, in 
partnership with Human Resources and Global 
Communications, develops the company’s health and wellness strategies. A global team of diverse health professionals and volunteers, known as Local Champions, helps refine and implement these approaches and define specific priorities.
BEWELL@BAXTER
Baxter recognizes that healthy employees are more engaged and productive and less vulnerable to safety incidents 
and injuries. Through BeWell@Baxter, the company’s global employee health and wellness effort, Baxter strives to create a culture that promotes work-related and personal health, raises awareness about these issues, and supports individual accountability and engagement.
The cornerstone of BeWell@Baxter is the Personal 
Wellness Profile, an online health risk assessment that helps employees understand how their lifestyle choices, family history and other factors influence their health and future health risks. The company uses this data to focus its health promotion program on areas of highest future health risk for employees. As of the end of 2016, more than 32% of Baxter’s employees worldwide had completed a Personal Wellness Profile.
1 
In 2016, more than 14,000 employees (28% of the total) logged more than 165,000 hours of exercise as part of the BeWell@Baxter Exercise Challenge. This represents a 29% increase in hours compared to 2015. Fifty-four percent of facilities worldwide took part in “Healthy Eating Month.”
OTHER PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES
Baxter ’s occupational health team also works to 
continually improve the company ’s performance 
with the following programs and initiatives:
• Flu v accinations   In 2016, Baxter offered free 
seasonal flu vaccinations to 97% of its employees; 31% of all employees were vaccinated. 
•
 Smok
e-free workplaces   In 2016, 89% of 
campuses with 25 or more employees were smoke-free, up slightly from 88% in 2015. The company asked facilities that are not smoke-free to set a date for that conversion, if allowed by local regulation.

Operations
Reduce environmental footprint 
through increased efficiency and resource conservation
Baxter is committed to driving sustainability 
throughout its global manufacturing operations.1  
The company strives to use energy, water and raw materials efficiently, while reducing waste and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This improves 
environmental performance while saving money and enhancing Baxter’s reputation.
The company’s environmental, health, safety 
and sustainability (EHS&S) vision is to achieve a sustainable enterprise that creates stakeholder value by advancing superior environmental stewardship, the highest level of employee health and well-being, and an injury-free workplace. Baxter’s EHS&S Policy outlines the company’s commitments within its operations and across the value chain. The company’s EHS&S governance structure helps the organization achieve its goals 
and create long-term business value.
Baxter follows a management-systems approach 
guided by its global EHS&S requirements. The company applies the ISO 14001 standard to manage its environmental aspects and the OHSAS 18001 standard to manage its health and safety hazards and risks. As of year-end 2016, 64 Baxter locations met the requirements of ISO 14001 and 48 sites were certified to OHSAS 18001. 
The company’s EHS&S audit program verifies that Baxter’s facilities have programs that achieve regulatory compliance and meet the company’s EHS&S requirements, objectives and goals. In 2016, Baxter conducted EHS&S audits at 22 facilities. 
With regard to environmental compliance, Baxter received four environmental Notices of Violation (NOVs) in 2016 (all related to wastewater) and paid $0 in environmental fines. The company settled one health and safety NOV during the year, and paid $1,529 in health and safety fines.
Since 1994, Baxter has published an Environmental 
Financial Statement (EFS) to demonstrate the  
value of the company’s proactive global environmental management program. The EFS reports total estimated environmental income, savings and cost avoidance realized in the reporting year. 
Baxter did not produce an EFS for 2016. The company intends to evaluate the EFS methodology for future reports.

ENERGY 
Using energy effectively enhances business 
efficiency, conserves natural resources and improves environmental performance. Reducing fossil fuel combustion decreases GHG emissions, improves air quality and decreases fine particulates that contribute to adverse health effects.
Baxter has a goal to reduce total energy use by 
15% indexed to revenue by 2020, from a 2015 baseline. In 2016, the company used 9,052 trillion joules of energy—1% less than in 2015, indexed to revenue. This includes electricity, fuel and purchased steam used by Baxter-managed and Baxter-operated facilities and excludes energy related to company-operated vehicles. Facility expansions and production increases in 2016 contributed to a 1% absolute increase in energy usage year over year. 
Energy conservation supports Baxter’s business 
because energy is one of the company’s most significant manufacturing costs. The company’s energy costs dropped 7% between 2015 and 2016, saving $11.4 million, due to decreasing energy prices. 
Site-specific energy assessments identify 
opportunities to conserve energy and to apply and share new technologies and best practices across the company. In 2016, Baxter performed energy assessments at 10 facilities worldwide. From those, the company identified 189 potential energy conservation projects, with possible annual savings of $4.8 million. Facility personnel also uncover possible energy conservation projects. 
During 2016, Baxter implemented 212 energy conservation projects that saved more than  
$5.6 million and 298 trillion joules of energy on an 
annual basis, avoiding more than 16,000 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
2e) of GHG emissions. 
Responsible energy procurement is integral to Baxter’s GHG emissions reduction strategy. At manufacturing sites in Europe, the company increased renewable power use to 73% of total 
electricity in 2016 from 51% in 2015, simultaneously saving $3.3 million through its global energy sourcing strategy.
Baxter has operated a Lean Energy Program 
for the company’s main manufacturing facilities since 2007. It includes four sets of Lean Energy standards—Prerequisite, Bronze, Silver and Gold. Each defines 14 to 35 requirements a facility must meet at that level, with a focus on process and system energy efficiency. By year-end 2016, 38 sites achieved Prerequisite status.
The Baxter global energy program began to apply the ISO 50001 standard in 2014 to its facility-level energy management systems. By the end of 2016, five company locations met ISO 50001 requirements, as verified by an accredited third party.
WATER AND WASTEWATER
Water issues continue to grow in importance worldwide. Although these concerns are global, they must be addressed at the local or regional 
level. Baxter works to better understand the projects implemented212

impacts of its water use across the value chain and 
implements conservation and efficiency projects at its manufacturing facilities.
Baxter has a goal to reduce total water use by 15% 
indexed to revenue by 2020, from its 2015 baseline. Baxter reduced water consumption by 1% indexed to revenue from 2015 to 2016. 
During 2016, Baxter used approximately 14 million cubic meters of water,
2 roughly equivalent to filling 
15 Olympic-size swimming pools every day. This equaled 2% more water than in 2015 in absolute terms and 1% less indexed to revenue.
Baxter considers several factors to identify water usage reduction opportunities and possible water conservation projects at sites, including total water used, water usage efficiency, and water cost and availability. Due to the strong link between energy usage and water processing, optimizing water systems remains a key focus of the company’s facility energy assessments. Additionally, Baxter integrates Lean manufacturing principles and tools such as value stream mapping
3 with water 
management to help facilities identify areas for additional conservation. The company has implemented many straightforward means of 
reducing water usage, leaving future reduction more difficult. Moreover, Baxter anticipates that business growth and manufacturing process changes will continue to present challenges in this area.
During 2016, several Baxter sites increased total water usage due to expansion or renovation, start-up and other changes in manufacturing processes. The company implemented water recovery and reuse projects at some facilities. For example, Baxter’s facility in Cali, Colombia, executed projects to recover and reuse process water, including condensate and reverse osmosis reject water. In addition, the facility changed sanitation practices to reduce water use. These efforts contributed to overall site reduction of approximately 10,000 cubic meters of water in 2016, despite a 5% increase in production.
Water issues vary significantly by location. In 2016, Baxter applied the World Business Council for  
Sustainable Development Global Water Tool to e
valuate the availability of renewable water supply 
at the company’s 60 largest water-use locations for which the tool provided data. These locations represented 95% of Baxter’s total water use. In 2016, facility water usage in extreme water-scarcity, water-scarce and water-stressed areas combined decreased by 2% in absolute terms and 4% indexed to revenue compared to 2015.
Wastewater
Wastewater discharged from Baxter ’s production 
operations is one of the company ’s most 
significant environmental compliance risks. In 2016, 60% of Baxter’s self-reported environmental incidents were exceedances of permitted wastewater discharge limits.To address existing wastewater compliance issues globally and to anticipate potential future ones, Baxter pursues an aggressive approach to wastewater compliance, evaluation and risk mitigation. Based on recent experience, the company has implemented a systematic wastewater risk management program that proactively identifies emerging issues. This involves a holistic review of major manufacturing locations that includes the following:
• E valuate effectiveness of facility change 
management processes used to assess possible 
impacts to wastewater generation  
and compliance;
•
 R
eview wastewater compliance history and 
recent data to identify possible trends and areas of concern;
•
 V
erify the effectiveness of procedures used to 
monitor compliance with wastewater permit conditions and methods used to investigate and remedy causes of noncompliant wastewater discharges;
•
 Use fiv
e-year production forecasts to compare 
wastewater treatment capacity and capabilities with anticipated production changes; and
•
 G
auge employee awareness of wastewater 
operations and roles in ensuring compliance.
In addition, the EHS&S Audit group periodically 
performs targeted wastewater assessments. These reinforce the importance of understanding the effects of wastewater discharges on compliance and the need for proper management of wastewater treatment.14

WASTE
Baxter identifies leading waste reduction 
opportunities based on the highest-volume waste streams, facilities that produce the most waste, sites with strong potential to improve, and other factors. The company tracks and analyzes waste data from each major facility to assess progress toward waste reduction goals and identify ways to improve processes that generate waste. Facilities measure waste at the point of generation to rapidly identify significant sources. These and other activities reduce expenses related to raw materials use, waste handling and disposal.
During 2016, Baxter ’s operations generated 77,900 
metric tons of total waste, up 4% from 2015 in absolute terms and 2% indexed to revenue.
4 The company’s operations generated 64,300 metric tons of nonhazardous waste during 2016, a 4% increase in absolute terms and a 2% rise indexed to revenue. Baxter attributes this increase to changes in manufacturing and expanded production at some of the company’s larger manufacturing facilities.
Reducing plastic waste and increasing recycling is essential, since plastic scrap from manufacturing is Baxter’s largest waste stream, representing roughly one-third of the company’s nonhazardous waste. Baxter also innovates to mitigate the environmental impact of product packaging. Read more in Product Innovation.
Regulated waste5 represents 17% of Baxter’s total 
waste. During 2016, the company’s operations generated 13,600 metric tons of regulated waste, up 7% in absolute terms and 5% indexed to revenue. This increase was due to higher-volume discards of a certain chemical waste at a facility in North America that expanded during the year, as well as improved reporting at that facility.
In 2016, Baxter recycled 73% of nonhazardous waste and 35% of regulated waste for an overall recycling rate of 67%. Recycling at Baxter generated nearly $5.8 million in net income in 2016.
6
Baxter has a goal to pursue zero waste-to-landfill by achieving a landfill diversion rate of 95% or higher at all manufacturing locations by 2020. In 2016, 18 manufacturing sites and one R&D facility achieved this rate, up 38% from 2015.GHG EMISSIONS ACROSS

Multinational companies can help address climate 
change by understanding their impacts across the value chain and decreasing GHG emissions. These are core elements of Baxter
’s sustainability efforts.
Baxter began reporting its Scope 1, Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 GHG emissions in 1997 and contributed to the development of the initial version of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a collaboration of World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.
Baxter estimates its 2016 GHG emissions footprint 
(Scope 1, 2 and 3)
7 at 5.1 million metric tons CO2e,8 
down 6% from the prior year. The main factor contributing to this decrease was GHG emissions associated with the use of certain products for which production and sales decreased in 2016. In addition, GHG emissions associated with product transport fell in part due to various improvements during the year. 
GHG EMISSIONS FROM OPERATIONS
Energy use accounts for 98% of Baxter ’s GHG 
emissions from operations, so the company 
focuses its reduction efforts in this area. In 2016, Baxter facilities completed 212 energy-conservation projects that reduced annual GHG emissions by more than 16,000 metric tons CO
2e. 
Other tactics include fuel switching, cogeneration, onsite renewable energy systems, renewable power procurement and green buildings.Baxter has a goal to reduce absolute GHG emissions from operations by 10% by 2020. In 2016, the company reduced GHG emissions from operations by 3% compared to 2015. Total net emissions from operations equaled 652,000 metric tons CO
2e in 
2016, including a subtraction of 137,900 metric tons CO
2e of carbon credits.
By the end of 2016, 28% of the company’s energy use for operations was from renewable sources. Biomass fuel for boilers at four company locations
9 represented 11% of total energy use, and 
the renewable energy component of purchased electricity and renewable energy certificates together represented 17%. On-site geothermal, solar photovoltaic and solar hot water systems contributed a small amount to the total.Baxter’s energy procurement team works to 
provide both sustainable and economical energy to all manufacturing sites. During 2016, the company sourced more than 160,000 MWh of 100% renewable electricity for Baxter’s European manufacturing sites. This represented 73% of total electricity for manufacturing in the region, up from 51% in 2015. In 2017, Baxter plans to increase this amount to 230,000 MWh of renewable electricity, equaling 98% of projected electricity use in European manufacturing operations. In most cases, savings realized through the company’s comprehensive global energy sourcing strategy finance the premium for green electricity contracts.
Globally in 2016, Baxter purchased more than 
250,000 MWh of electricity generated from 100% certified renewable power, a 25% increase from 2015, including all electricity purchased by the company in Illinois. Baxter was recognized as 
the 23rd largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the United States during the year.
10
Since 2007, Baxter has maintained carbon neutrality at its headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois, through electricity generated from certified renewable energy sources. The company offsets facility-related emissions from purchased electricity and from fuel combusted on-site.

Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 . 
To integrate these standards and policies into the company’s business, Baxter considers social and environmental criteria in its purchasing decisions in addition to standard dimensions such as price and quality. The company incorporates corporate responsibility criteria into its requests for proposal and supplier contract templates.
Managing Procurement Risks
In 2016, Baxter developed an overarching strategy and a risk-based approach to manage supply chain corporate responsibility risks. The strategy is designed to help the company structure and prioritize its engagement in this area.Supplier Corporate Responsibility 
Survey
At the end of 2016, Baxter invited 211 global 
and regional top direct and indirect suppliers to participate in its Supplier Corporate Responsibility Survey, a key part of the company’s due diligence. The survey covers program governance as well as environmental, social, and health and safety aspects. Eighty percent of the 211 suppliers surveyed responded. Baxter will provide suppliers with a report card based on the data they provided. 
Supplier Audits
Baxter launched its supplier audit pilot program in 2016 and conducted one audit in Asia Pacific, two in North America and two in Europe. The audit format, aligned with the Pharmaceutical Supply  
Chain Initiative (PSCI) protocol, covers ethics, labor, environmental, health and safety, and related management systems.
Supplier Diversity 
Baxter develops mutually beneficial relationships with small and diverse suppliers, and works to continue to increase the diversity of its supplier base.  
The company spent nearly $370 million in 2016 with small suppliers in the Unit
ed States and Puerto 
Rico. The decrease compared to 2015 resulted from reductions in service-related and capital expansion projects associated with the spin-off of Baxalta. During the year, the company also spent $89 million with women-owned businesses and $40 million with minority-owned firms in the United States and Puerto Rico. Veteran-owned, service-disabled 
veteran-owned, disadvantaged and HUBZone-certified businesses represented $6.7 million,  
$0.5 million, $12.4 million and $0.8 million of Baxter’s 
spending, respectively.SUPPLY CHAIN CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Baxter transports more than 4.5 million metric tons of raw materials and finished goods each year throughout its global supply chain. The company mainly partners with third-party vendors and carriers. In some instances, Baxter operates its own product distribution system, such as a private fleet for renal product home delivery in certain countries. 
The company’s total worldwide GHG emissions 
from product transport equaled 336,000 metric tons CO
2e in 2016, equivalent to 75 kilograms 
CO2e per metric ton of products transported, a 
25% decrease from 2015.
Baxter’s approach to improving efficiency and 
decreasing GHG emissions in this area includes:
Optimizing the distribution network   The use 
of innovative technologies, such as state-of-the-art transport management systems and route optimization tools, saves time and money while improving environmental performance. In the United States, Baxter implemented a load optimization tool that increased average trailer utilization by 4%. In addition, Baxter closed and consolidated nine distribution warehouses globally.
Intermodal transport   
Combining multiple 
transportation modes for a single shipment can 
decrease costs and overall GHG emissions; for example, by converting road to rail for parts of a route. In Europe, the company converted 
approximately 30% of its road freight to rail in 2016. Also in Europe, the company has begun to try out the use of rail to Asia rather than air. Overall, Baxter used rail for approximately 8% of its freight globally in 2016.  
Environmentally responsible partnerships     
Baxter is one of a select number of companies that participate in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay
® program as both 
a Carrier and Shipper Partner. As a member of Green Freight Asia, Baxter works to enhance the company’s Asia Pacific green optimization transport strategies and technologies. BAXTER SUPPLIER DIVERSITY SPENDING

Innovation That 
Expands Access to Care
Improve access to healthcare  
for the underserved
Baxter’s products often make the difference between 
life and death. According to the World Health Organization, at least 400 million people globally lack access to one or more essential health services. For this reason, the company is dedicated to sustaining and increasing access to healthcare in communities through public and private partnerships and capacity-building grants. Along with its partners, Baxter is also committed to being first on scene in times of crisis with product and resource donations. 
ADVANCING PUBLIC HEALTH
Baxter collaborates with other organizations to expand the availability of its treatments and advance public health. This includes educating current and potential patients worldwide, as well as training physicians and other healthcare 
professionals. The company also enters into public-private partnerships to share best practices in manufacturing and treatment. Additionally, Baxter collaborates with governments, companies and other organizations to influence policy and standards that promote patient access to therapy and products.
Sharing Best Practices for End-Stage 
Renal Disease Treatment
The "Flying Angel" program focuses on the 
sustainable care and delivery model for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in rural parts (prefecture-level cities and counties) of China. The program is a partnership between Baxter and the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC). In 2016, the program was profiled by Health News, the official publication of the NHFPC, for its contribution to building ESRD awareness and drive access to PD therapy, calling the program a model for “micro healthcare reform” in prefecture-level cities and countries. Since the program’s launch in 2012, thousands of ESRD patients in the six pilot provinces have benefited from significant improvement in the standard of care, infrastructure and affordability of PD therapy.
As part of the Flying Angel program, a doctor treats a 69-year-old farmer 
receiving peritoneal dialysis at her home in Yichuan County, Luoyang City, Henan Province, China.Product

PRODUCT DONATIONS
Baxter donates products to help improve access to 
healthcare worldwide.
During the year, Baxter continued to work with its 
humanitarian aid partners—Americares and Direct Relief—to pre-position products for emergencies and to address ongoing needs in underserved communities. In 2016, Baxter added a third product donation partner, Partners In Health, to help strengthen health systems in poor communities around the world. To maximize impact, Baxter donates items that recipient organizations have requested through a critical needs list, such as IV solutions and hemostatic sealants. 
Medical Missions
When healthcare professionals travel overseas to provide charitable medical care to underserved populations, they often work in hospitals and clinics that lack modern  
surgical materials.Baxter’s hemostatic and tissue sealant products, anesthesia products, and IV solutions are among the most requested items in these situations.
During 2016, Baxter products were used in 43 
countries as part of 161 medical outreach trips supported by Americares.

PUBLIC POLICY
Many legislative issues affect Baxter’s business 
globally, including reimbursement, tax, trade and a variety of regulatory concerns. The company’s Government Affairs and Public Policy (GAPP) team works with lawmakers, governments and policymakers worldwide to support patient access to the company’s lifesaving therapies, increase understanding of the benefits of those therapies, address barriers to care and explore possible solutions. This involves engaging with governments to improve the regulatory environment and reimbursement structure for Baxter’s therapies and collaborating with clinicians, nongovernmental organizations and patient groups to increase access to healthcare for millions of people worldwide.
The Quality, Compliance and Technology Committee 
of Baxter’s Board of Directors oversees the company’s government affairs activities. The committee reviews Baxter’s positions on pending legislation and political advocacy efforts. For additional information, see Baxter’s 2016 Political Contributions Report, which details political contributions reviewed by the Baxter Political Action Committee Board of Directors. It also includes information about the company’s membership in certain trade and industry groups.
Baxter was ranked among the first tier of companies in the 2016 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability. Baxter’s key 
public policy focus areas include accelerating the rate at which new treatments can reach patients, home dialysis, kidney disease education, and support of diverse populations.21st Century Cures Act
Baxter, along with medical technology association 
AdvaMed, supported U.S. Congressional passage of the 21st Century Cures Act in 2016. This legislation is intended to improve the process for regulatory advancement and approval of new treatments, and will help improve the innovation ecosystem for devices, diagnostics and drugs.
Engagement on Home Dialysis
Baxter belongs to the Alliance for Home Dialysis, an organization focused on advocacy, policy and thought leadership. The company participated in the 2016 Alliance for Home Dialysis Capitol Hill Briefing in Washington, DC, to further the dialogue about the benefits of home dialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease. The workshop provided a forum for the home dialysis community and U.S. Congressional staff to discuss emerging policy opportunities to ensure patient choice in treatment.
Home dialysis is an alternative to in-center treatment, which generally requires patients to visit a clinic three times a week. Despite the widely accepted and well-documented benefits of home dialysis compared with in-center treatment—including improved outcomes associated with more consistent treatments, enhanced patient satisfaction, improved quality of life and lower costs—only about 11% of U.S. dialysis patients receive treatment at home.
Home Delivery of Renal Products
In the United States, the dispensing of pharmaceuticals is governed by laws and regulations at the state level. Baxter works to 
help shape state policies to better align with the company’s Renal Home Patient service.
This project has had several milestones. In 2015, the National Association of State Boards of Pharmacy adopted language in the State Pharmacy Model Act that exempts manufacturers of dialysis supplies and drugs from registration as a pharmacy to deliver products to patients’ homes. In 2015, Georgia and North Carolina enacted similar laws. Florida enacted the changes in 2016, and Michigan exempted the practice by rule. Baxter teams are working to expand law adoption in several additional states during 2017.
Supporting Diverse Populations
In April 2016, Baxter’s GAPP team held its fourth annual Minority Health Month Fly-In in Washington, DC. Representatives of Baxter’s business resource groups came from across the country to underscore the importance of developing strong public policies in the healthcare and medical device sectors to help address healthcare disparities that continue to affect racial and ethnic minorities. The team met with members of the Tri-Caucus, including the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.
During 2016, Baxter representatives also attended 
The National Minority Quality Forum Summit, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Legislative Conference, National Black Caucus of State Legislators Annual Meeting and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Public Policy Conference.Product

For example, in 2016, Baxter’s 52 renal therapy sites in Colombia reported as a single entity. The reporting scope excludes certain leased facilities for which environmental performance data are not available or are not material to Baxter’s overall environmental performance. The health and safety data included in this report are based on 168 reporting locations. The EHS information reported covers 100% of Baxter’s operations unless noted otherwise. EHS data are revised to reflect acquisitions, divestitures and plant closings as well as to incorporate any corrections necessary due to additional data verification activities (such as EHS&S audits). See the Baxter Data Summary for additional detail.

3 W ater value stream mapping is an interactive, Lean manufacturing tool that helps facilities better understand the quantity 
and quality of water used in their processes and identify opportunities for reduction or reuse.
4 Baxt er reports “regulated waste” rather than “hazardous waste.” This term includes some materials that would otherwise 
be classified as nonhazardous in some countries, which helps Baxter harmonize its waste reporting across locations. In addition to wastes typically considered hazardous (such as toxics and corrosives), the company also includes oils, biohazardous or infectious materials, batteries, fluorescent lamps, asbestos and other materials that may not be defined as hazardous waste by national legislation at the point of origin.
5 T o more closely reflect production efficiency and support consistent evaluation of facility performance and trends, 
Baxter excludes certain non-routine, non production-related waste streams from its total waste performance data and progress against its 2020 waste goal. These waste streams are construction and demolition debris, remediation waste and wastewater treatment sludge.
6 Inciner ation with energy recovery is considered recycling.
7 T he company’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have a high level of certainty and have been verified for the past seven 
years to a reasonable assurance level by Bureau Veritas North America. Scope 3 categories are based on various assumptions and estimates. For the past five years, Bureau Veritas North America verified to a limited assurance level Baxter’s methodology and emissions factors for calculating Scope 3 GHG emissions.
8 T he market-based method is used for Scope 2 unless otherwise stated. Data in this report are presented in accordance with 
the GHG Protocol (Scope 1 and Scope 2) and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.
9 In 20 16, Baxter used biomass fuels to generate energy in boilers at three Baxter locations in the United States, India and 
Italy. Additionally, another of the company’s facilities in India purchases steam from a biomass-fueled boiler owned and operated by a third party. During the year, emissions from the Baxter-operated biomass boilers equaled 148,000 metric tons CO
2. In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, these are not included in reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions. However, also in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the company includes CO2e emissions from the 
CH4 and N2O components of biomass combustion in its reported Scope 1 emissions.

BAXTER DATA SUMMARY
1 W ork-related injuries or illnesses requiring medical attention beyond first-aid, including cases with days lost. Data for 2014 
include sites that became Baxalta on July 1, 2015. All rates based on 100 full-time employees working one year, which equals 200,000 work hours. For tracking purposes, Baxter follows U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordkeeping requirements worldwide. Thus, in cases where an injury occurs and conflicting medical opinions arise as to the number of days away and/or restricted days that should be recorded, Baxter records on the basis of the most authoritative physician’s opinion. Rates exclude acquisitions until January 1 of the first year following at least 18 months with Baxter. Baxter includes occupational diseases and illnesses, such as hearing loss and ergonomic disorders, within its broader categories of cases, but does not track or report those items separately. Due to privacy regulations in the company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa region, Baxter does not classify or report injuries by gender. Supervised contracted employees are included in the injury statistics reported below and are not tracked separately. Independent contractors are not included in Baxter’s injury data, because they are supervised by other organizations. 
2 W ork-related injuries or illnesses that cause an employee to lose at least one full day after the date of the incident. Data for 
2014 include sites that became Baxalta on July 1, 2015. 
3 T he number of days lost (including weekends and holidays) recommended by the most authoritative physician’s opinion due 
to work-related injuries or illnesses. Baxter does not count the date of injury and date of return to full duty as lost days. Data for 2014 include sites that became Baxalta on July 1, 2015. 
4 The number of days recommended by the most authoritative physician ’s opinion that an employee or supervised 
contractor is unable to work full duty (including weekends and holidays) due to a work-related injury or illness. Baxter does not count the date of injury and date of return to full duty as restricted days. Data for 2014 include sites that became Baxalta on July 1, 2015. 
5 Da ta for 2014 include sites that became Baxalta on July 1, 2015. 
6 Ibid. 
7 Ibid. 
8 Da ta do not include Gambro. Data for 2014 include sites that became Baxalta on July 1, 2015. 
9 Some t otals vary from sum of items in category, due to rounding. 
10 T otals reflect the removal of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) as an air toxic by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
EtO = ethylene oxide; DEHP = Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate. 
11 Includes air emissions associated with on-site energy generation. Emission factors from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency publication Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, AP-42, Fifth Edition, Volume 1: Stationary Point and Area Sources. 
12 Includes s tationary sources (Stationary Sources (facilities) Subtotal line item from Baxter Value Chain Energy Usage and GHG 
Emissions table) and excludes energy consumption associated with Baxter-operated mobile sources.  
13 Baxt er’s Lean Energy Program began in 2007. Early in 2016, Baxter introduced new Lean Energy Program requirements and 
updated some existing ones to better align the program with ISO 50001 requirements for energy management.
14 Excludes waste associated with U.S. Renal Home Care operations, since patients dispose of unused product rather than returning it to Baxter for disposal. Also excludes construction and demolition debris, remediation waste and wastewater treatment sludge. Removing these waste categories from the company total allows for more consistent evaluation of facility performance and trends over time. 
15 Excludes production by-products reused on-site, construction and demolition debris and wastewater treatment sludge. Includes discarded/returned products (such as intravenous solution, dextrose solution, etc.) that are nonhazardous in nature but may be classified as regulated in some countries. Excludes waste associated with U.S. Renal Home Care operations, since patients dispose of unused product rather than returning it to Baxter for disposal. 
16 Excludes waste recycled on-site, remediation waste, construction and demolition debris and wastewater treatment sludge. Includes certain waste streams (such as waste oils, batteries, fluorescent lamps, light ballasts and asbestos) not classified as regulated in some locations.
17 Water usage from Baxter’s 60 sites with the greatest use, representing 95% of the company’s total annual water 
consumption. Availability of renewable water supplies evaluated using the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Global Water Tool. Extreme-scarcity areas have less than 500 cubic meters of renewable water resources per person per year. Water-scarce areas have at least 500 cubic meters but less than 1,000 cubic meters. Water-stressed areas have at least 1,000 cubic meters but less than 1,700 cubic meters. Water-sufficient areas have at least 1,700 cubic meters but less than 4,000 cubic meters.

This number may be different than the value of Baxter products distributed during the year by the company’s relief partners. See Innovation That Expands Access to Care. 
BAXTER VALUE CHAIN ENERGY USAGE AND GHG EMISSIONS 
1 Baxt er used the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol to calculate emissions data from fossil fuel use. The company used country electricity emission factors published by the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) E-Grid U.S. regional electricity emission factors to calculate GHG emissions related to electricity consumption. 
2 Bur eau Veritas North America, Inc. verified to a reasonable level Baxter’s 2015 and 2016 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG 
emissions. Bureau Veritas North America, Inc. also verified Baxter’s methodology for determining 2015 and 2016 Scope 3 GHG emissions to a limited level. 
3 Es timated based on an environmentally extended input-output model from an independent third party and Baxter’s 
revenue and sector of operation. 
4 Es timated based on capital expenditures and an estimated emission factor per million dollars of capital expenditure from 
benchmarking with industry. 
5 Es timated based on Baxter’s actual yearly energy usage by energy type and GHG emission factors for each energy type 
per GaBi life cycle assessment software. 
6 Estimated by the company’s independent transportation service provider based on shipment of products to Baxter customers. 
7 Es timated emissions for wastewater treatment by municipalities and off-site waste recycling and disposal based on 
Baxter’s waste generation by type, guidance provided by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (United States), and the U.S. EPA WARM model. 
8 Estimated based on domestic and international air mileage, rental vehicle mileage, and hotel room stays provided by Baxter’s global travel providers, and using emission factors from UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, Greenhouse Gas Protocol Mobile Combustion GHG Emissions Calculation Tool, and Carbonfund.org Business Travel Calculator. 
9 Es timated based on the number of Baxter employees by country and statistics on commuting time and transport mode 
split into public transport, passenger cars, taxi and motorcycle, and walking or bicycling. Emission factors for each mode were obtained from Defra. 
10 Emis sions associated with upstream leased assets are included in Baxter’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
11 Baxt er used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition to determine 
GHG emissions associated with using biomass fuel, principally wood/wood waste, as a boiler fuel at four Baxter locations. These emissions were calculated as 129,000 and 148,000 metric tons CO
2 in 2015 and 2016, respectively. CO2e emissions 
from CH4 and N2O components of biomass combustion included in reported Scope 1 emissions. 12 Includes the pur chase of electricity generated from 100% certified renewable electricity (Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, 
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States), and the purchase of carbon credits from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. 
13 Baxt er used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to estimate GHG emissions associated with reported fuel usage by company-
managed sales and distribution fleet vehicles and other vehicles. The company estimated fuel usage for international sales and distribution vehicles based on regional sales information. 
14 R efrigerant emissions represent reported CFC, HCFC and HFC refrigerant losses by each Baxter location. Baxter calculated 
associated GHG emissions using actual emission factors for each reported refrigerant. 
15 Es timated based on previous Baxter product LCAs as well as the company’s revenue by product type. Category 1 emissions 
were extrapolated to other categories depending on the product type. 
16 Es timated based on an environmentally extended input-output model from an independent third party and revenue from 
Baxter’s contract services business. 
17 Es timated based on production quantities and global warming potential information for certain types of products. Emissions 
for certain other products estimated based on previous Baxter product LCAs as well as the company’s revenue by product type. Category 1 emissions were extrapolated to other categories depending on the product type. 
18 Baxt er engaged an independent third party to estimate 2015 GHG emissions associated with investments using an 
environmentally extended input-output model, Baxter’s retained shares in the spin-off of Baxalta, and Baxalta’s 2015 revenue and sector of operation. 
19 T otals do not include CO2 emissions from Baxter-owned wood-fired boilers. See footnote 11 above for detail.

42             BAXTER 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
APPENDIX:   Independent Assurance Statement
Introduction and objectives of work
Baxter engaged Bureau Veritas North America, 
Inc. (BVNA) of the Bureau Veritas Group to conduct an independent assurance of selected sections in Baxter’s 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report (the Report). Baxter has commissioned assurance for the EHS section of its annual corporate responsibility/sustainability report for the past 18 years.
This Assurance Statement applies to the related information included within the scope of work described below. That information and its presentation in the Report is the sole responsibility of Baxter management. BVNA was not involved in the drafting of the Report. Our sole responsibility was to provide independent assurance on the accuracy and reliability of information included, and on the underlying systems and processes used by Baxter to develop content for selected sections of the Report.
Scope of work
Baxter requested BVNA to conduct reasonable level assurance of the following:
Data and information included in the following sections of the Report:
• Pr oduct Innovation except the Quality and Patient Safety 
subsection
•
 Emplo
yee Health and Safety
•
 Oper
ations
Baxter requested BVNA to conduct limited level assurance of the following:
Data and information included in the following section of the Report:
• R esponsible Procurement and Logistics
Excluded from the scope of our work is any assurance of 
information relating to:
• A ctivities outside the defined assurance period, the calendar year 
of 2016;
•
 P
ositional statements (expressions of opinion, belief, aim or future 
intention) by Baxter and statements of future commitment;
•
 An
y financial data previously audited by an external third party; 
and
•
 Da
ta and information included in sections of the Report that are 
not listed in the scope of work above.
Methodology
Our work was conducted against BVNA’s standard procedures and guidelines for external Assurance of Sustainability Reports, based on the requirements of the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) as the reference assurance standard and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Guidelines as the reference reporting protocol.
The work was planned and carried out to provide reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance except for the Responsible Procurement and Logistics section, which was carried out to provide limited assurance. We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for our conclusions.
As part of BVNA’s assurance process, BVNA undertook the following activities:
1.  Interviews with relevant Baxter personnel responsible for collecting and reporting performance data and other information for Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability (EHS&S);  Product Innovation; and Responsible Procurement and Logistics sections of the Report. These interviews included discussion with management personnel and staff members responsible for preparing text and contributing data for sections of the Report within the scope of this assurance.
2.  Review of documentary evidence produced by Baxter to support information presented in Report sections within the scope of this assurance.
3.  Evaluation of the information presented in the selected Report sections based on consideration of the GRI G4 Guidelines with emphasis on principles of accuracy, accessibility, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness.
4.  Audit of performance data including review of a sample of data to source documentation during visits to operating sites located in: Deerfield, Illinois, United States; Haina, Dominican Republic; Liverpool, United Kingdom; Lund, Sweden; Meyzieu, France; Opelika, Alabama, United States; and Shanghai, China.
5.  Audit of performance data including review of a sample of data to source documentation.
6.  R eview of Baxter data and information systems used for 
collection, aggregation, analysis and review of information subject to assurance during visits to Baxter’s corporate EHS offices in Round Lake, Illinois, and Baxter’s headquarters office in Deerfield, Illinois.
Our findings
On the basis of our methodology and the activities described above, it is our opinion that the data and information within the Product Innovation (except the Quality and Patient Safety subsection), Employee Health and Safety, and Operations sections of the Report:
•
 ar
e accurate, reliable and free from material mistake or 
misstatement;
• ar e presented in a clear, understandable and accessible manner;
• pr ovide a fair and balanced representation of activities; and•
 allo
w readers to form a balanced opinion of Baxter’s activities 
and performance during the calendar year of 2016.
In addition, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the 
data and information in the Responsible Procurement and Logistics section are inaccurate or that the information is not fairly stated.
It is also our opinion that Baxter has established appropriate 
systems for the collection, aggregation, analysis and review of relevant information and data in the sections of the Report within the scope of this assurance.Additional commentary
During the assurance process, BVNA was pleased to observe that Baxter has:
•
 Es
tablished new priorities and goals to allow for balanced 
reporting through 2020;
•
 Suc
cessfully incorporated EHS data from Gambro acquisition 
sites into the reported data for global operations;
•
 R
evised and strengthened requirements and guidance on  
EHS data reporting at the facility level to improve the 
c
onsistency of data reporting from global operations; and
•
 Impr
oved the process for tracking supplier diversity data.
Based on the work conducted, we recommend Baxter consider the following:
• C ontinue to streamline processes for reporting GHG emissions 
based on scope for global operations; and
•
 C
ollect information related to green logistics throughout the year 
to allow for efficient reporting of significant accomplishments in the Corporate Responsibility Report.
