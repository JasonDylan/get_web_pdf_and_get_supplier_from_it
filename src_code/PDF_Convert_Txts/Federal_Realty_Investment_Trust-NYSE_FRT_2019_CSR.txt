A Sustainable Mindset .
2019 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTLetter from our CEO.
When we think about ESG at Federal, we see it as an integral 
part of our DNA, one that has helped us build a truly sustainable 
business— with no better indicator than our 52-year record of 
increased annual dividends to our shareholders, an unmatched 
record in the REIT industry that puts us in the company of less than 
30 other publicly traded U.S. companies.
With our inaugural sustainability report, we hope to provide more 
context around our ESG efforts, including the sustainable principles 
we apply to our developments and capital investments, the efficient 
way we operate our properties, and our social programs aimed at 
supporting our employees and the communities we serve.
It starts with our portfolio of assets, where our focus during our 
more than 50-year history has been on owning high-quality 
properties in population dense locations; it is the focus of our 
development efforts on reinventing and reinvesting in our 
properties; it includes our long-standing belief that investing in 
placemaking is the foundation for creating an enduring bond 
with our communities; and it is prioritizing our people to provide 
them with the best opportunities to learn and grow in a healthy 
environment. Federal can weather accelerating changes in the 
retail landscape and consumer expectations.As the world has evolved, so have we. Thinking about how to 
better develop and operate our properties is a natural way of 
doing business for us and has always been embedded in our 
decision-making. It’s what led us to introduce solar power into 
our properties more than a decade ago. Combined with the LED 
lighting upgrades at 60% of our properties, energy efficiency has 
been a long-standing priority. We’ve invested $1.4 billion in efficient 
buildings that have either earned LEED certification or are on 
track to do so. We concentrate on water conservation and waste 
diversion, not because it is the popular thing to do, but because it is 
the right thing to do. The list goes on, but the results are clear—at 
Federal, environmental, social and financial sustainability go hand 
in hand. 
We see the accomplishments outlined in this report not as the end 
goal but as the groundwork for continuous improvement—in 2020 
and for years to come.

average ownershipAbout Federal.
Federal Realty Investment Trust (Federal) is a recognized leader in the 
ownership, operation, and redevelopment of high-quality retail-based 
properties located primarily in major coastal markets from Washington, 
D.C., to Boston, as well as San Francisco and Los Angeles. Founded in 
1962, Federal’s mission is to deliver long-term, sustainable growth through 
investing in densely populated communities where retail demand exceeds 
supply. Our expertise ranges from small neighborhood shopping centers 
to urban, mixed-use neighborhoods and everything in between. We 
invest in retail-based locations that have the best prospects of delivering 
sustainable growth and increasing in value over the long term.
We understand that past success does not guarantee success in the future. 
That is why we continually reinvest in our properties as the environment 
and business climate change. We adapt to changes in the communities in 
which we operate. We partner with forward-thinking tenants. We prioritize 
doing what we can today to position our properties and our business to 
be relevant and successful five, 10, and 15 years from now. Sometimes that 
involves converting a car-centric shopping center with a sea of parking into 
a mixed-use, transit-friendly destination that combines retail, residential, 
and office uses with inviting public parks and gathering spaces as we did 
with Pike & Rose, Assembly Row, and Santana Row. Sometimes it is as 
simple as creating an engaging public space at a shopping center with an 
exciting tenant lineup that makes the property the destination of choice 
for the surrounding community, as we did with Plaza Del Mercado in Silver 
Spring, MD, and Willow Lawn in Richmond, VA. Other times it is simply 
improving the operations of properties that remain a mainstay in the 
community. As a fully integrated U.S. retail real estate company, we are 
confident in our ability to provide a sustainable real estate portfolio, no 
matter the circumstance.SILIC ON VALLEYCHICA GOBOS TON

LETTER FROM OUR CEO ABOUT FEDERAL /  2 SUSTAINABILITY AT FEDERAL OUR STRATEGY CONCLUSIONSustainability at Federal.
At Federal, sustainability is not a separate function carried out by a 
handful of professionals. Rather, it is a mindset that permeates our 
company from top to bottom. We define sustainability broadly to 
include environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters that can 
materially impact the long-term success and value of the company. 
Sustainability in its broadest sense is simply our way of doing business.
Why it Matters
Sustainability Improves Asset Longevity
Thoughtfully designed and constructed buildings combined with smart 
management of day-to-day operations increases the lifespan of our 
properties, ensuring they are built to last and stand the test of time. This 
is truly important for us as a long-term owner of real estate, as nearly a 
quarter of our properties have been in our portfolio for more than 30 years. 
Sustainability Increases Value
Introducing technologies and practices that better manage energy, 
water, and waste reduces our operating costs, which in turn creates more 
value for our tenants and shareholders while lessening the impact of our 
business on the environment.
Sustainability Creates Connection
Tailoring the property experience to the unique needs and desires of the 
local community positions our properties to be part of the fabric of that 
community, not just a place to transact business.

SUSTAINABILITY AT FEDERAL /  3 OUR STRATEGY CONCLUSION ABOUT FEDERAL LETTER FROM OUR CEOOur Strategy .
Financial, environmental, and social sustainability are intrinsically linked. This 
belief guides the way we invest, build, and operate, beginning with our initial 
investment decision to acquire a property and continuing through the entire 
lifecycle of the property. Our approach to sustainability has four pillars:

LETTER FROM OUR CEO ABOUT FEDERAL SUSTAINABILITY AT FEDERAL OUR STRATEGY CONCLUSION /  4EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY INVESTING WITH AN EYE TO THE FUTURE OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
Federal approaches all investment decisions 
through a long-term lens. Our longstanding 
governance structure requires that all but de 
minimis investments undergo a rigorous approval 
process through our Investment Committee 
and/or Board of Trustees. All of the financial 
and physical aspects of the property or other 
investment are debated at length before we 
allocate our shareholders’ capital to the proposed 
investment. We evaluate the prospects for the 
investment to deliver sustainable long-term 
increases in cash flow and value. For newly 
acquired properties or partnerships, that requires 
an understanding of the environmental and 
physical condition of the property, the property’s 
exposure to climate-related risks, whether the 
property and the tenancy serve the needs of the 
community, and whether any potential partner 
shares our view of real estate being owned 
and operated to be sustainable for the long 
term. When the investment requires significant 
construction, we carefully consider the materials 
incorporated into the property and methods used 
to complete the construction. This approach is well 
vetted and thorough to ensure we are investing in 
properties that will be successful in the long term.PROPERTY HIGHLIGHT

Development
We make significant investments in our own assets, 
re-imagining them in ways both big and small and 
making them sustainable for the long term. We 
focus our development on adding to or adaptively 
reusing our existing properties, not on greenfield 
development. In some cases, this has required 
significant environmental remediation, resulting 
in the re-imagination of entire communities, as 
evidenced at Assembly Row (see case study on 
page 7). We approach each new development 
thoughtfully and purposefully, with a focus on 
building the right product for the unique local 
market. We engage with the local community to 
understand who they are and what matters to them 
so that we design and build a product that not only 
serves the neighborhood but also enriches it over 
decades and generations. We focus on creating 
places that are both enduring and endearing—
providing memorable, resilient, and immersive 
gathering places that support efficient operations 
and resonate with the community.Using innovative and sustainable practices in the 
design and building process is a central part of this 
development strategy. We believe that building 
for the long term means adopting green building 
best practices, supporting sustainable design and 
construction, and making our properties resilient to 
natural disasters and the impacts of climate change. 
Key components of our development process include:
 Resilience: Decision-making that takes into 
account climate and weather risks
 Materials:  Environmentally responsible use of 
materials and practices
 Water: Site and building design to reduce 
stormwater runoff through green roofs, rain 
gardens, and Silva Cell systems
 Energy: Energy modeling and commissioning to 
manage energy impacts of design
 Education:  Briefings for development and 
construction teams on current best practices in 
sustainable design and green building First

OUR STRATEGY /  6 ABOUT FEDERAL LETTER FROM OUR CEO SUSTAINABILITY AT FEDERAL CONCLUSIONFrom decaying industrial buildings and brownfields to a vibrant, transit-oriented neighborhood, Assembly Row in Somerville, 
MA, exemplifies our sustainability ethos and our approach to thoughtful investment decisions. It is home to over 70 retailers and 
restaurants, 1,700 residents, and 6,000 office workers. Most importantly, it sustains and supports its community holistically.
Reimagining the Neighborhood
Prior to becoming Assembly Row, this site served as a Ford 
Motor Company assembly plant and steel factory, and the 
nearby Mystic River had become an outlet for waste. Federal 
made significant investments in environmental remediation 
and infrastructure to transform the project into the healthy 
urban community that it is today.
Sustainable Development
Green spaces and community and wellness focused tenants 
host more than 100 events a year to promote health, 
productivity, and quality of life. Assembly Row is also home 
to the first Somerville office building to achieve LEED Gold 
status and has one of the USGBC’s top 10 green roofs in 
Massachusetts.Solar Energy
The on-site rooftop solar array produces over 875,000 kWh of 
electricity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 1.3 million 
pounds of CO2.

Assembly Row hosts bee colonies and one of our restaurant 
tenants incorporates the hyper-local honey into menus and

Operational excellence is at the heart of 
Federal’s business model. We maintain a 
culture of continuous improvement focused 
on finding opportunities to reduce costs, 
improve performance, and enhance the tenant 
and consumer experience. This results in our 
properties—some of which we have held for more 
than 50 years—maintaining relevance throughout 
their lifecycles.  
 
This philosophy led Federal to become a leader in 
sustainable practices before ESG criteria reached 
the mainstream. Sustainability is embedded 
in the way we manage the resources used at 
our properties, monitor ongoing operational 
performance, and ensure tenants and vendors 
operating on site are meeting our standards. From 
big investments in innovative energy technologies 
to small changes in property management 
practices, we work to improve every day. We invest

Since 2010, we have invested nearly $38 million in solar 
photovoltaic systems at 24 properties located in six different 
states, with more in the pipeline. On-site solar reduces the 
environmental impact of our properties and improves their 
long-term resilience. We now have 13.3 MW of installed capacity 
generating over 13 million kWh of electricity on an annualized 
basis—enough to power nearly 1,200 homes for a year.
The solar electricity generated at our properties is used to power 
our common areas and is sold to such tenants as Whole Foods, 
TJ Maxx, Nordstrom Rack, and Target to power their stores 
and help them achieve their own sustainability goals. Using 
renewable energy to partner with our tenants is a win-win for 
both us and our tenants while also lessening the environmental 
impact of our properties.OUR STRATEGY

Nordstrom has significantly reduced its 
electric costs by purchasing the solar 
power produced on the roofs of our Federal

added benefit, the amount of greenhouse 
gas emissions the projects have prevented 
is the equivalent of removing over 100 
vehicles from the road for one year. ” 
—JOHN PEDRINI  
 VP of Facilities & Energy  
Nordstrom (2018) Focus on Water
Reducing our water consumption cuts water-related energy use and carbon 
emissions while reducing operating costs and improving the resilience of 
our properties. Between 2018 and 2019 we reduced our common area water 
consumption by 3%, equating to over 6.5 million gallons. This has been achieved 
through a variety of actions including real-time data monitoring, proactive 
maintenance, and integrating water-efficient fixtures, controls, and landscaping in 
construction and design requirements. 
Focus on Waste
We actively manage our waste streams by using right-sized equipment, deploying 
technology for data intelligence gathering, and coordinating with our tenants. Our

mixed-use, walkable properties. This will provide our employees with 
access to public transit commuting options, food, activities, and 
services without getting into a car, as well as inviting public spaces where they can relax and recharge at any time during the day. 
Approximately 70% of our office employees will work out of LEED-
certified buildings, where they will have the benefit of the improved 
lighting and air quality that come with those designations. As we’ve 
designed these offices, we’ve also invested in improvements such as 
ergonomically designed desk chairs, adjustable height desks, and 
standing height conference room tables. We want our employees to 
thrive; investing in their work environment is one way to help them 
on that path.

Our Communities
Federal invests in the neighborhoods where we do business. On any 
given day, you can find families gathering, grandparents chatting, 
and business meetings taking place at our properties. We are 
honored to have an opportunity to be a connector and facilitator in 
our communities. Through events, partnerships, philanthropy, and 
thoughtfully designed spaces, we provide the place to bring people 
together and enhance the long-term vitality of our communities. 
By being good neighbors, we help build 
quality neighborhoods and healthy 
communities. This is not only the right 
thing to do—it is the bedrock of our 
sustainable business model and an 
expression of our commitment to 
investing for the long term. Many of our 
properties include spaces for people 
to connect such as open green areas 
where concerts are held and communal tables and outdoor living 
rooms where friends and families gather. Each year, we host or 
support nearly 700 events at our properties ranging from volunteer 
days to social events to community art. Examples of community 
events we supported in 2019 include: Wynnewood Shopping Center  in Wynnewood, PA, hosted the 
36th Annual National Night Out in partnership with the National 
Association of Town Watch and Lower Merion Community Watch. 
Thousands of residents, nonprofits, and businesses gathered 
with first responders to strengthen the neighborhood spirit, 
promote police-community partnerships, and support local 
anti-crime programs. The event featured music, food, a carnival, 
and crime prevention awareness activities presented by the local 
police department.
 Bethesda Row, located in Bethesda, MD, hosted the Great  
Strides walk, an annual run/walk event to raise money for the 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The Foundation raises money for 
research to combat cystic fibrosis, which is a genetic disease  
that impacts the lungs.
 Assembly Row in Somerville, MA, celebrated Pride Month in 
June 2019. In partnership with Boston Pride, The Row hosted 
events including a banner unveiling ceremony with City Council 
representatives and the LGBTQ+ liaison for the City of Somerville, 
a silent disco to benefit New England’s first domestic violence 
prevention agency, and a movie screening of Love, Simon for all 
of Assembly Row and the Somerville community to enjoy.

Philanthropy
Through the years, we have partnered with many local and national charities in our 
communities to provide our time, funding, and donations to support our neighbors 
and contribute to causes important to our employees. Examples include:
 Charity Match:  Every year, the Federal charity raffle solicits employee donations 
to a chosen charity, which are then matched 1-to-1 by Federal. The charities we 
select are recommended by employees and therefore have a deep personal 
connection for our team. Some of the most recent groups we have supported are 
Children’s National Hospital, Autism Speaks, and Boulder Crest Retreat—a rural 
sanctuary in nearby Virginia where combat veterans, first responders, and their 
families can enjoy recreational and therapeutic activities aimed at assisting with 
their physical, mental, financial, and spiritual wellness. 
 Donations for Kids: We hold an annual holiday toy drive for Toys for Tots, and 
team members support the Neediest Kids organization, which provides school 
supplies, backpacks, and other basic essentials to low-income students.
 Hunger Relief:  Our Philadelphia office has volunteered over 450 hours of time at 
Philabundance’s Hunger Relief Center, where they help pack and sort donated 
food and prepare it for distribution to our neighbors in need every year. 
 Coat Drive: Through One Warm Coat, our Santana Row property in San Jose, CA, 
hosts an annual holiday coat drive which has collected over 75,000 coats during 
the 16-year partnership.
 Manna Food Center: In 2019, Federal partnered with the Manna Food Center on 
their Community Food Rescue program. At Bethesda Row as well as Pike & Rose, 
Federal facilitated the coordination between restaurant tenants and Manna 
Food Center to donate unsold food to those in need.

Effective Governance.
The long-term success Federal has 
enjoyed has only been possible as 
a result of the strong governance 
practices put in place by our Board 
of Trustees, and the expectation 
set by our Board for the company 
and our employees to conduct 
business in accordance with the 
highest ethical standards consistent 
with our values. Some of the key 
underpinnings of our governance 
structure and policies are:
 Independent Chairman of the 
Board since 2003
 Diverse board with 2 of 7 
Trustees being women
 Annual election of Trustees with 
no ability to classify the Board 
unless approved by shareholders
 Majority vote for Trustees in 
uncontested elections
 No poison pill in effect
 Requirements for Trustees and 
senior management to own a 
significant amount of our shares
 Absolute prohibition on Trustees 
and employees hedging or 
pledging our sharesOur Board of Trustees also adopted 
a Code of Conduct that applies 
to every employee and addresses 
things such as conflicts of interest, 
prohibition on bribery, fair dealing 
with third parties, and protection 
of Federal’s assets. An additional 
Code of Conduct was put in place 
by our Board to specifically address 
our most senior officers as it relates 
to professional integrity and 
appropriate controls with respect to 
all our financial reporting. Each year 
our senior officers acknowledge 
their agreement to be bound by 
that Code of Conduct. Violations 
of the Code of Conduct can be 
reported anonymously through a 
telephone hotline that is displayed 
in our offices and on our internal 
communications platform. There 
have been no calls to our hotline for 
more than a decade.
