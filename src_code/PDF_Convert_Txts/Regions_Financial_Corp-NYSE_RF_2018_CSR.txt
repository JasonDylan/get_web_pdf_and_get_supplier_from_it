About This Report
The 2018 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report (this Report) covers the period of January 1 through
December 31, 2018, unless otherwise noted. Regions uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework to provide
transparent and comparable disclosure of our economic, environmental, and social impacts. This Report references
the GRI Standards (2016), as specified in the GRI Content Index at the end of the Report. This Report should be read
in conjunction with our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, 2018 Annual Review, 2019 Proxy Statement, and 2018
Community Engagement Highlights, all of which contain additional information about Regions and can be found on

The terms “Regions, ” the “Company, ” “we, ” “us, ” and “our” as used herein mean collectively Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, together
with its subsidiaries, including Regions Bank (the Bank), when or where appropriate.
This Report uses certain terms, including those that the GRI guidelines refer to as “Material Topics, ” to reflect the issues of greatest importance to Regions and
our stakeholders. Used in this context, these terms should not be confused with terms, such as “material” or “materiality, ” as defined by or construed in

management’s current expectations as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available to, management at the time the

"Our culture, built on integrity, trust, and respect,
our values, and our mission form the foundation
for how we work together to create shared value
for all of our stakeholders. "
– John M. T urner, Jr. , President and CEO
In July 2018, I had the distinct honor of assuming the role
of Chief Executive Officer following the retirement of
Grayson Hall. Under Grayson's leadership, Regions
embraced shared value as a foundational approach to
operating our Company. This means that what we do as a
business should benefit our customers, associates,
shareholders, and the communities in which we live and
work. During Grayson's tenure, Regions also introduced
Regions360® with the goal of putting customers' needs at
the center of every interaction, helping them meet their
unique financial goals and aspirations. And most
importantly, we've built a culture where associates
support and embrace the belief that Regions prospers
when all our stakeholders benefit. 
As we begin a new chapter, we are committed to
remaining focused on our mission to make life better and
create shared value. More than ever, we must
consider how environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) matters affect our Company, and be transparent
about our ESG practices and performance. In this Report,
you will learn how Regions is working to advance our ESG
efforts to make life better for our customers, associates,
and communities, while creating long-term value for our
shareholders. Associates
Our associates are our greatest asset. We are committed
to investing in their continued professional development
and providing the skills and tools to more effectively and
efficiently serve our customers. These efforts include
reskilling and upskilling associates to help them meet the
needs of tomorrow's workplace. We are also dedicated to
associates' well-being and financial wellness. For
instance, we raised the entry-level wage to $15 per hour,
continued our commitment to retirement readiness by
increasing our 401(k) Plan matching contribution to 5
percent, and enhanced our parental leave benefits to
provide birth mothers with 12 weeks of paid leave and
birth and adoptive parents with six weeks of paid leave. 
We understand that a diverse and inclusive workforce is
not only a business imperative—it's a competitive
advantage. This past year, we created the Diversity and
Inclusion Center of Expertise within Human Resources to
foster a culture of inclusion and assist us with recruiting
and retaining diverse talent. We recognize communities
have varying needs, and having a diverse team of
associates that reflects our customers and our
communities is critically important to our long-term
success. 
Customers
Our customers' expectations are changing, and we
recognize the need to serve them efficiently, effectively,
and at a lower cost. By streamlining our processes and
investing in technology, our associates can dedicate their
time to productive conversations with customers, using
data and analytics to provide customers with
comprehensive financial advice. While we are focusing on
continuously improving, we will not lose sight of our
approach of putting customer needs at the center of the
relationship and providing trusted financial advice and
relevant products and services tailored to meet the
unique needs of each customer. 
Driven by our associates' focus on meeting customers'
needs, Regions continues to earn numerous industry
accolades, as well as top-ranked customer satisfaction
scores from third-party organizations. 
Communities
Last year, we continued building on our legacy of
community engagement by focusing our investments on
areas where we can have the most meaningful and
measurable impact. We formed the Corporate
Responsibility and Community Engagement team that
 2018 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report                                                                                                                       2brings together expertise to address issues that matter
most to our customers, associates, and community
partners. 
Guided by a purpose-led and performance-driven
approach, we identified three community investment
priorities that align with our core values and the skills and
talents of our associates: Economic and Community
Development, Education and Workforce Readiness, and
Financial Wellness. Further, to assure our sustainable
commitment to the community, we endowed the Regions
Foundation with $60 million in 2018 in addition to the $40
million in 2017. 
Environment
To build on our established sustainability initiatives,
Regions adopted an Environmental Sustainability Policy
Statement and environmental goals to accelerate our
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and energy use.
I am proud to report that since 2008, we reduced our
operational greenhouse gas emissions by 47 percent. We
understand Regions has a role in supporting the adoption
and development of sustainable infrastructure and renewable energy. In 2018, we provided capital for the
development of utility-scale solar projects with 147
megawatts of generating capacity and advised corporate
customers on green bond issuances. As our sustainable
finance platform continues to grow, we will expand our
investments and advisory opportunities in this area.
* * *
Regions understands that strong ESG practices are
essential for creating shared value and for generating
long-term value for all of our stakeholders. We are
committed to transparency and continuously evaluate
opportunities for adopting leading practices and
enhancing our ESG reporting. We hope that you find this
Report informative and appreciate your interest in
Regions.
Sincerely,
John M. Turner, Jr.
President and Chief Executive Officer
 2018 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report                                                                                                                       3A MESSAGE FROM YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS
As Directors, we are responsible for providing effective
governance and oversight of Regions' business for the
long-term benefit of all stakeholders, including Regions'
customers, shareholders, associates, and communities.
Regions and the Board recognize the intersection between
strong environmental, social, and governance (ESG)
practices and the long-term success of the Company,
which is why we are focused on ensuring the Board has
the proper skills and knowledge to effectively oversee ESG
matters and to constructively challenge management on
topics relevant to the Company. 
Director Skills and Education . The Board is committed to
ensuring we have the right skills and expertise within our
membership to appropriately oversee the management of
current and emerging ESG and sustainability topics. We
fulfill this commitment by continuously evaluating which
skills are currently represented on the Board and make
sure there are no gaps.
As part of this effort, we onboarded new Directors with
extensive experience in sustainability, cybersecurity, and
human capital management. These Directors have a
broad understanding of ESG and have been valuable
resources for both the Board and management in the
execution and oversight of the Company's ESG program.
Additional information about Directors' skills and
qualifications is available in the 2019 Proxy Statement.
Director education programs are also critical for fostering
Board effectiveness. Directors are regularly provided with
materials on emerging ESG topics. We also participate in
educational sessions in connection with on-site Board
meetings and attend conferences and seminars. As an
example, Ceres, a nonprofit organization that seeks to
build sustainability leadership and solutions, presented to
the Board on effective oversight of ESG and the skills and
board structure needed to oversee these topics. 
We also are interested in understanding our shareholders'
expectations of the Board. We have met with governance
representatives from our largest shareholders on matters
related to governance, board composition, and other ESG
matters. Management also provides the Board with a
quarterly corporate governance engagement update. 
Formal Oversight of ESG . While all Board committees
oversee certain aspects of ESG, we formally assigned
oversight responsibility of environmental matters and
corporate responsibility to the Nominating and Corporate
Governance (NCG) Committee. This past year, for example,
the NCG Committee oversaw the development of Regions'
Environmental Sustainability Policy Statement andenvironmental goals, Human Rights Statement, and
Vendor Code of Conduct. 
In 2018, the Board also centralized the oversight of human
capital management and culture under the Compensation
Committee, which was renamed the Compensation and
Human Resources (CHR) Committee. Under its revised
charter, the CHR Committee is responsible for the
oversight of associate conduct, engagement, and career
progression; diversity and inclusion initiatives and results;
talent acquisition, development, and retention;
performance management; and employment practices. 
Diversity . We believe a strong and effective Board is
diverse. In February of 2019, we approved changes to our
Corporate Governance Principles that reaffirm our
commitment to Board diversity. When searching for
candidates, the NCG Committee will include diverse
candidates in the pool for any open Board seat. We
believe this intentional step ensures that our Board
reflects Regions' customers, associates, and communities.
We also provide a Board Skills and Composition Matrix in
our 2019 Proxy Statement that highlights the Board's
diversity, including racial/ethnic, gender, LGBTQ+, non-US
born, multilingual, and veteran status.
This Report will help you better understand how Regions
and the Board are continuously considering and
managing ESG matters. As always, we welcome your
feedback.

Three foundational elements serve as the basis of our culture: our values, our mission, and our vision. We list them in this
order for a reason: our values guide our day-to-day life, how we treat customers and each other, and the expectations for how
we behave. Our mission defines our corporate purpose and answers the question, “What do we want to accomplish when we
work together?” And our vision is what we aspire to, what we want the company to look like when we follow the values in
service of our mission.
Our Values 
  
Put people first
Have respect for every person. Listen. Care. Serve others before yourself. Build the best team. Be
inclusive. Work as one team. Balance work in a full life. Lead humanely. Set the good example. And
remember to say thank you.
Do what is right
Always. Be honest. Do what you say. Use common sense. Stand for quality and integrity. Take the long
view. Earn trust. Be responsible and accountable.
Focus on your customer
Serving the customer as one team, in an exceptional way, is our business, our only business. Know your
customer. Serve your customer. Be committed. Understand needs. Meet needs. Make your customer's life
better by what you do. Create shared value.
Reach higher
Grow. Our Company must grow, and we must grow prudently. Raise the bar. Be energetic. Be innovative.
Achieve excellence. Improve continuously. Inspire and enable others. Succeed the right way. Improve
efficiency and effectiveness.
Enjoy life
Have fun. We are in the business of banking. But more importantly, we are in the business of life. Enjoy it.
Laugh. Be creative. Celebrate. Recognize success.
Our Mission 
Our mission is to achieve superior economic value for our
shareholders over time by making life better for our
customers, our associates, and our communities and
creating shared value as we help them meet their financial
goals and aspirations. We do this by providing competitive
financial products, excellent service, and trusted financial
advice.
Shared value is at the core of our mission and business
strategy. It is a simple idea: what we do as a business
should benefit our customers, Company, and
shareholders, as well as the communities where we live
and work. This is the path to sustainable business; it is
how to make a decent profit in a decent way. The products
and services we sell must be priced fairly, so that they
provide value to our customers and to the Bank, while
benefiting shareholders appropriately. And ultimately, the
products and services we sell must benefit our
communities because the Company will only be as strong
as the communities we serve. Our Vision 
Regions aims to be the premier regional financial institution
in America through being deeply embedded in our
communities, operating as one team with the highest
integrity, providing unique and extraordinary service to all
of our customers, and offering an unparalleled opportunity
for professional growth for our associates. 
Our vision statement is an aspiration. It clarifies what we
do, where we do it, and how we will execute. This
statement defines our future, and we can achieve it by
working as one team to focus on our communities and our
customers, helping them succeed financially. 
We do this by providing expert financial advice, guidance,
and education to customers; building well-developed
business plans that we execute with discipline; building
on a foundation of integrity and trust; delivering excellent
customer service and convenience; and offering
associates the opportunity to grow professionally and be
part of an outstanding team.

Regions' strong corporate culture is founded on the idea
that creating shared value for all stakeholders—
customers, shareholders, associates, and communities—is
the right way to operate our business. This culture is a
strength that we believe uniquely positions us to execute
against our strategic plan to generate consistent,
sustainable long-term performance. As we strengthen our
culture, we build an organization that is more balanced,
diverse, inclusive, and thoughtful. We enhance our
customer service quality, increase associate engagement,
and create a strong risk management culture. Leaning into our corporate culture and teams, along with
our excellence in customer service, is fundamental for us
to achieve our strategic plan. Our strategy is anchored in
our unique strengths, which include our bankers and
associates, culture, markets, risk management processes,
and how we deliver superior customer service.

how it is aligned with our strategy in the
2019 Proxy Statement
Stakeholder Engagement  
Our business requires that we consider the needs and viewpoints of a broad range of stakeholders. We believe that
engagement is an ongoing, two-way communication, and we seek to share information about our viewpoints, strategies, and
practices while simultaneously learning from our stakeholders.

Shareholders
Engaging with our shareholders and soliciting their points
of view is critical to providing long-term value to all of the
Company's stakeholders. We are committed to holding
constructive and meaningful communications with our
shareholders and building ongoing relationships
throughout the year. 
We have a formal year-round corporate governance
engagement program, and we encourage shareholders to
candidly provide their views on corporate governance
issues, including executive compensation and
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. In
2018, we reached out to institutional shareholders
representing approximately 63 percent of Regions'
outstanding stock held by institutional investors.
Information obtained during these engagements is
summarized and presented to management and the
Board of Directors (the Board). In addition, our Board
engages directly with institutional shareholders through
corporate governance events, presentations to the Board,
and other engagement opportunities.Engaging Through Governance Organizations
Regions engages with shareholders through our

In addition, in early 2019, Regions became a Ceres
Company Network Member. Ceres is a sustainability
nonprofit organization that works with investors and
companies to build leadership and drive sustainability
solutions. Through this partnership, Regions will be able
to leverage Ceres' in-house expertise and relationship
with shareholders and other stakeholders in order to
gain insights into ESG best practices, shareholder
expectations, and other ESG-related guidance. 
Throughout the year, Regions also engages with third-
party ESG rating organizations; standard-setting
organizations, such as the Sustainability Accounting
Standards Board; and proxy advisory firms.

shareholders across various forums, including sell-side
conferences, roadshows, and investor visits. In 2018,
Regions held in-person meetings with 369 investors and
potential investors. These meetings included 69 percent
of Regions' top 25 largest active investors.
In the Corporate Governance Shareholder Engagement
section of our 2019 Proxy Statement  on pages 52 and 53,
we provide a thorough discussion of the actions that we
have taken in response to shareholder feedback. 
Customers
Regions' core value to  focus on your customer  drives our
actions to constantly improve the customer experience.
We do this primarily by listening to our customers in every
contact channel and business to make sure we are both
providing exceptional customer experiences and following
up on any issues customers bring to our attention. We
actively solicit feedback from customers via surveys,
social media, and in-person comments, and through these
engagements and feedback we continuously try to
improve the customer experience.
See the Customers  section of this Report for more
information on how we engage with our customers. 
Associates
We solicit feedback from and communicate with
associates through various channels, including a formal
associates engagement survey; a monthly Company-wide
meeting that is led by our CEO; our intranet site,
life@regions; and monthly "Now Share This" discussion
guides for managers. 
Regions also offers several channels, including an
anonymous 24-hour Report It! Hotline, through which
associates may raise ethical concerns and report
violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations,
the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code of
Conduct), or other Company policies and procedures.
See the Associates  section of this Report for additional
information about how we engage our associates. 
Regulators and
Policymakers
We have transparent and open relationships with our
supervisory regulators to ensure that Regions meetssupervisory expectations and that the regulatory
authorities are aware of all key business activities. Senior
management and the Board dedicate significant time and
resources throughout the year to meeting with regulators
to engage in productive dialogue and to promote full
compliance with supervisory expectations in a timely
manner. Further, across the Company, our businesses and
support functions engage with regulators through exams,
continuous monitoring, and meetings. On a regular basis,
Regions provides a wide range of management and
committee reports to regulators. Additionally, Regions
engages with state and federal lawmakers and agencies to
understand their priorities and to express our views on
issues that may affect our business.
See the Corporate Governance  section of this Report for
more information about the processes and governance
around our engagement with policymakers.
Communities and Nonprofit
Organizations
Regions engages with individuals in our communities and
nonprofit organizations on matters that are important to
our stakeholders. Through the Corporate Responsibility
and Community Engagement team, we build partnerships
with organizations to bring meaningful change in the
communities where we live and work by addressing local
community development needs and promoting inclusive
economic growth. Our Market Executives located
throughout the footprint, with support of Community
Relations Officers and Community Development
Managers, are also charged with engaging their local
communities and responding to those communities'
needs. 
Furthermore, the Regions Community Development
Corporation and its board of directors provide Regions
with valuable insights into community needs that can be
met through the Regions Community Reinvestment Act
(CRA) program. And our external Diversity Advisory
Council, comprised of academic, community, and
business leaders, provides Regions with an objective
outside perspective and guidance on diversity-related
matters that are important to our customers, associates,
and communities. 
In addition, through memberships and advisory roles held
by associates, we engage with organizations that focus on
ESG, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards
Board, Ceres, and the Council of Institutional Investors. 
See the Communities  section of this Report for more
information about our community investment and
engagement activities.

At Regions, our decisions are filtered through the lenses of
the Company's values, mission, and vision. This holds true
for the decisions we make with respect to corporate
governance. Regions' Board oversees executive
management, who work to ensure we are in compliance
with laws and regulations, and provides guidance for
sound decision-making and accountability. Maintaining
legal and regulatory compliance is, however, a minimum
standard, and we endeavor to exceed this by adopting
leading governance practices.
Further, we strive to conduct business according to the
highest ethical standards, as evidenced by our Code of
Conduct. Our associates and Directors take the Code of
Conduct seriously and are mindful of our values, in
particular,  do what is right . We maintain an environment
of openness and transparency and take every opportunity
to promote Regions' values. We do this because it is the
right thing to do, and our customers, shareholders,
communities, and associates expect it if they are to
continue giving us their trust and confidence. 
The Board and management understand that good
governance is the foundation of sustainable business and
good decision-making and is necessary for creating
shareholder value over the long-term.
Board of Directors
The Board assumes an active role in providing oversight
of, and guidance to, our executive management team and
in maintaining a strong system of checks and balances.
The Board believes that an appropriate Board leadership
structure includes a substantial majority of independent
Directors with diverse backgrounds and experiences;
extremely capable Committee Chairs; and strong
independent leadership. 
Our 2019 Proxy Statement includes information about the
Board and its committees and their respective
responsibilities, as well as a Board Skills and Composition
Matrix that sets forth, on a Director-by-Director basis,
various elements of diversity and skills that each
contributes to the Board's oversight of the Company.
Though Director evaluations are year-round, Directors
undergo a robust annual evaluation process to help
ensure each is actively contributing to the Board's
operations and that all necessary skills are present. In
addition to individual Director evaluations, the full Board
and the committees also conduct separate evaluations.Board Profile

The Nominating and Corporate Governance (NCG)
Committee, which oversees the Board evaluation process,
is also responsible for identifying and assessing potential
candidates for directorship using the criteria established
by the Board and set forth in the Corporate Governance
Principles. Since 2016, the Board has appointed six new
Directors (one of whom was appointed on January 1,
2019). Each of these new Directors has provided unique
skills and backgrounds that complement the other
Directors, thus providing the Board with additional
diverse points of view when making decisions and
providing oversight.

Our Board and its committees oversee matters related to Regions' ESG practices, performance, and disclosure. Through this
process, Directors provide management with feedback and guidance on the Company's ESG efforts. 
The NCG Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's practices and reporting with respect to environmental
stewardship and corporate social responsibilities that are of significance to the Company and its stakeholders—our
customers, shareholders, associates, and communities. The NCG Committee also assists the Board in establishing and
maintaining effective corporate governance policies and practices. Further, the Compensation and Human Resources (CHR)
Committee oversees Regions' strategies and policies regarding corporate culture and other human capital management
functions, including: (i) associate conduct, engagement, and career progression; (ii) diversity and inclusion initiatives and
results; (iii) talent acquisition, development, and retention; (iv) performance management; and (v) employment practices. 
Additionally, the Risk Committee is responsible for the oversight of the Company's risk management practices, including the
review and approval of the Risk Management Framework, the Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement, and significant risk
management policies and limits that guide the prudent pursuit of risk and reward across the Company. The Audit
Committee is responsible for ensuring that the Company's policies, procedures, and controls that protect our customers
and associates are functioning at an optimal level. 
Examples of ESG topics discussed with and reported to the Board and its committees in 2018 include: 
  The development of Regions' Human Rights Statement and Vendor Code of Conduct
  The Environmental Sustainability Policy Statement and related environmental goals
  Talent management matters, including associate conduct, associate retention, and sexual harassment policy review
  Report on the implementation and effectiveness of Regions' Code of Conduct and related ethics programs 
  Reports on information technology, cyber and information security, business resilience, and privacy
  Political contributions report 
To further broaden the Board's understanding of ESG topics, all Directors participated in an educational seminar led by
Ceres on the role of boards in overseeing ESG matters.
Management
In July 2018, after 38 years of service to Regions, Grayson
Hall retired from the position of CEO, and John Turner
assumed this role. Mr. Turner joined Regions in 2011 as the
Regional President of the South Region. He was named
head of Regions' Corporate Bank in 2014 and became
President in 2017. 
In addition to the CEO transition, Regions took significant
steps to streamline our organizational structure to
increase innovation, accountability, and performance. We
restructured our bankers into one team focused on local
markets and customers, and we integrated leaders into
three lines of business: the Consumer Banking Group, the
Corporate Banking Group, and the Wealth Management
Group. These changes simplified our structure and
created more alignment with our business strategies.Mr. Turner and his direct reports compose our Executive
Officers, the Company's most senior management body.
The Executive Officers are responsible for approving and
implementing policies and procedures that drive Regions'
operations and for overseeing execution of strategic
initiatives of the Company. Further, our Executive
Leadership Team, which consists of the Executive Officers
and additional members of senior management, is
responsible for reviewing the businesses' , markets' , and
support groups' performance against the Company's
strategic and financial plans.

94.5%  shareholder approval of our
executive compensation program in 2018
Our ability to successfully compete and grow our business
greatly depends on the skill, acumen, and motivation of
our executives and their ability to develop and execute a
dynamic strategic plan. With this in mind, the CHR
Committee established the following guiding principles of
compensation to serve as the foundation of our
compensation philosophy:
ü Compensation targets should be competitive
ü Actual compensation levels should be related to
performance, with incentive compensation, which
is considered "at-risk," playing a greater role in the
total compensation for more senior officers
ü Compensation should be aligned with the long-
term interests of our shareholders and consistent
with the safety and soundness of the Company
ü Compensation programs and levels should incent
sustainable, profitable growth without encouraging
associates to take unreasonable risks that may
damage the long-term value of the Company
ü Compensation programs should align with our
corporate values
The CHR Committee provides oversight for executive
compensation and has designed a balanced program that
provides competitive fixed-base compensation, as well as
incentive compensation opportunities for performance
over the short- and long-term. To establish target pay
levels, the CHR Committee considers market-competitive
pay and practices, then uses formulaic determinations
and discretionary factors to determine actual
compensation for the year. The CHR Committee considers
an objective evaluation of performance based on business
results to be critical; however, it also believes in the
importance of applying discretion, flexibility, and
judgment in the decision-making process to ensure
executive compensation places equal weight upon both
near-term performance and progress toward longer-term
objectives. 
In providing oversight, the CHR Committee considers
feedback from independent compensation consultants,
proxy advisory firms, shareholders, and regulators.

compensation program in the 2019 Proxy
StatementEthical Business Conduct
We value our relationships with associates, customers,
vendors, and the communities where we work and live. In
every interaction, Regions must be regarded as
trustworthy, honest, and fair. By having a strong Code of
Conduct, we demonstrate that doing what is right is not
just a slogan—it is the way we do business.
The Code of Conduct is designed to provide resources
and guidance to help ensure, among other matters, that:
 Regions and its associates remain in compliance 
       with all applicable laws and regulations 
 Regions is a safe and nondiscriminatory place to  
       work and conduct business 
 Confidential and proprietary information is 
       protected 
 Inappropriate gifts or favors are not accepted or             
       given
 Conflicts of interest are avoided 
The Code of Conduct is about more than compliance; it is
about what is expected of each associate and how we
maintain trust with those we serve. Associates are
required to complete annual Business Conduct and Ethics
training and attest they have read and understand the
Code of Conduct. The CHR Committee reviews all
revisions to the Code of Conduct annually and receives an
annual report on the status of Regions' ethics objectives. 
Our executive-level Ethics Council is responsible for
enforcing our standards of conduct and considering all
potential violations of the Code of Conduct that could
have a material effect on Regions, including matters
involving executive-level associates. The Council meets on
a quarterly basis, or more frequently if necessary, and
provides a quarterly report to the CHR Committee on all
matters presented, as well as an annual report regarding
the overall status of Regions' ethics objectives.
Refer to the  Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics  for more information about our
programs and policies 
Anticompetitive Activities
Antitrust laws prohibit agreements among competitors to
restrict competition. Regions strictly prohibits associates
from conspiring with any of Regions' competitors to fix
prices, allocate markets and customers, or refuse to deal
with particular suppliers or customers. When in contact
with Regions' competitors, associates must avoid
discussing how Regions conducts its business.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX

All associates must abide by the laws, regulations, and
policies impacting the financial services industry, as well
as other more broadly applicable federal and state laws
and regulations, including employment laws, antitrust
laws, insider trading laws, and criminal laws governing
fraud, embezzlement, anti-corruption, and bribery.
Regions provides multiple channels for associates to file
complaints and report suspected violations of the Code of
Conduct and/or potentially suspicious behavior or
unlawful or illegal conduct by customers, associates, or
vendors. Two of these channels, the Report It! Hotline and
the Report It! website, are administered by a third party
and are available seven days a week, 24 hours a day to
enable associates to make reports anonymously.
Regions considers retaliation to be a serious violation of
Company values and the Code of Conduct. Regions
prohibits retaliation of any kind for good faith reports of
alleged ethical violations or unlawful or illegal
conduct. Regions' No-Retaliation Policy is set forth in the
Code of Conduct and in other Company policies.
No-Harassment Policy
Our policies and values are strongly aligned to maintain a
workplace culture of respect, which we reinforce through
annual required training on how to identify harassment in
the workplace and report it. Our No-Harassment Policy,
which applies to associates, customers, and vendors,
clearly defines sexual harassment and other prohibited
conduct. Our No-Retaliation Policy complements the No-
Harassment Policy by prohibiting retaliation against
associates who make good faith reports of unethical,
unlawful, or illegal conduct. 
We want associates to clearly understand what our
policies prohibit and, therefore, require Respect in the
Workplace training on a regular basis. The course focuses
on respect and inclusion at work, as well as the policies
and laws in place that offer associates protection. It
includes tools to help associates recognize behaviors that
do not support our culture and values and how an issue
can be reported.
Associates have a duty to immediately report harassment,
discrimination, and other prohibited conduct. Complaints
may be reported directly to Human Resources or the
Office of Associate Conduct (OAC) or anonymously
through Report It!. The OAC investigates all allegations of
associate misconduct and ensures that complaints are
investigated promptly and fairly. Oversight by the OAC
helps ensure our preventative measures, how we handle
complaints, and our resolution efforts are effective. Toensure associates are comfortable reporting violations,
we protect the confidentiality of complaints to the extent
possible.
Office of Associate Conduct
Acting as an independent and centralized office, the OAC
oversees the handling, investigation, and resolution of
complaints involving associate conduct and regularly
reports these findings to the Board and its committees.
Corporate Political Activity
Like most public companies, Regions recognizes that
decisions made by governmental agencies and lawmakers
can have a significant impact on our operations,
shareholders, customers, and associates. Accordingly, we
monitor and track issues that affect our business and
express our views to lawmakers and regulators. Part of
that advocacy includes engagement in the electoral
process through the use of legally permissible corporate
political contributions. 
Regions' Policy on Political Contributions and Code of
Conduct govern and promote the highest standards of
behavior by the Company and our associates with regard
to political activities. In addition, these contributions are
overseen by a committee comprised of members of the
Executive Leadership Team, the Head of Government
Affairs, and the Manager of State Government Affairs. The
Boards' Risk Committee, as well as the full Board, receive
a report on the Company's annual corporate
contributions and non-deductible portions of trade
associations' dues. Reports are reviewed and certified to
be in compliance with the Policy on Political
Contributions by Regions' General Counsel. In addition,
Regions discloses semi-annually our independent
expenditures and corporate political giving.

Compliance
Regions has built a strong risk culture. In fact, one of
Regions' strategic priorities is to Enhance Risk
Management. Our risk culture is supported by a risk
governance process, clear “tone at the top, ” associate
ownership, escalation expectations and open
communication, and in-depth training. Risk Ownership
and Awareness is one of our core foundational disciplines
that helps make risk management a part of who we are
and makes every associate responsible for risk
management. Our risk management framework outlines
our approach for managing risk that includes the four
components discussed below.
Culture: A strong, collaborative risk culture ensures a
focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary
mindset and behavior to enable effective risk
management and promote sound risk-taking within the
bounds of our risk appetite. Our risk culture requires that
risks be promptly identified, escalated, and challenged,
thereby benefiting our overall performance. 
Risk Appetite:  Our risk appetite statements define the
types and levels of risk we are willing to take to achieve
our objectives. 
Process:  Effective risk management requires sustainable
processes and tools to effectively identify, measure,
mitigate, monitor, and report risk.
Governance:  Governance serves as the foundation for
comprehensive management of the risks that we face. It
outlines clear responsibility and accountability for
managing, monitoring, escalating, and reporting both
existing and emerging risks.Risk Ownership and Awareness
As part of Risk Ownership and Awareness, every
associate is responsible for risk management. This
approach is put into practice through the concept of the
"three lines of defense." Associates in the Business
Groups, who deal with our customers daily, form the first
line of defense. They identify and address risks ranging
from fraud to credit decisions. Risk Management forms
the second line of defense, acting as coaches and guides
to, and monitors and challengers of, the first line.
Internal Audit and Credit Review form the third line,
providing an independent review of the work of the first
two lines.
Financial Crimes Risk Management 
Regions is committed to complying with both the letter
and the spirit of the laws and regulations that govern
sanctions and prohibit money laundering and terrorist
financing. Our comprehensive, Company-wide, Corporate
Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) and
Office of Foreign Assets Control Compliance (OFAC)
Programs consist of corporate policies and standards
applicable to all Regions associates, management,
affiliates, subsidiaries, and business units. We
continuously review our policies and procedures and
update them as needed. Regions remains committed to
ensuring not only that all our policies and procedures fully
comply with rules and regulations, but also that these
policies and procedures are clearly communicated and
accessible to our associates. The Corporate BSA/AML and
OFAC Policies and Standards, as well as Business Unit
BSA/AML and OFAC Procedures are posted on our intranet,
life@regions. Additionally, as part of our effort to ensure
that the BSA/AML and OFAC Policies are widely
understood and observed, we track participation in
Regions’ mandatory BSA/AML and OFAC training
programs. We also provide targeted, supplemental
training for certain associates. 
BSA/AML and OFAC risk governance is accomplished
through formal oversight by the Board and its Risk
Committee, which approve the BSA/AML and OFAC
Programs. The Risk Committee receives reports related to
BSA/AML and OFAC from management on at least a
quarterly basis. We also have a Financial Crimes Risk
Management department responsible for BSA/AML and
OFAC Compliance oversight, a BSA/AML/OFAC Operations
department, a Corporate BSA/AML Officer and OFAC
Officer, and a BSA/AML Oversight Committee (BAOC),
which is a management-level special purpose committee.
All of these governing bodies and their roles are intended
to oversee and monitor the effectiveness of the controlsCORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX
 2018 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report                                                                                                                       15and processes in place to identify, measure, mitigate,
monitor, and report on BSA/AML and OFAC risks. 
The effectiveness of the BSA/AML and OFAC Programs, as
well as associates' adherence to the requirements of the
Programs, is subject to ongoing testing by our Audit
department. Regions is also subject to periodic BSA/AML
and OFAC-focused regulatory examinations. Our Board,
along with senior management, receive regular reports on
regulatory submissions filed by Regions as required by
various BSA/AML and OFAC laws and regulations and our
BSA/AML and OFAC Programs. 
Individual recognition and accountability are paramount
to the success of our BSA/AML and OFAC Programs.
Accordingly, Regions has a program that is administered
by Corporate Security, with oversight by BAOC, to reward
associates for exceptional efforts in monitoring and
referring potentially suspicious activity. Additionally,
adherence to the requirements of the BSA/AML and OFAC
Programs is built into associates' performance
evaluations. 
Human Trafficking 
Human trafficking is one of the largest criminal
industries in the world, and as a financial institution, we
play a role in helping recognize and report suspicious
activity. In 2018, Regions partnered with Hope for
Justice, a Nashville-based nonprofit that works to end
human trafficking, to train hundreds of our associates on
how to spot victims of, and participants in, human
trafficking. By knowing some of the financial methods
used by traffickers and how to identify red flags, Regions
and our associates can alert law enforcement and help
reduce the prevalence of human trafficking. 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption
Our Code of Conduct prohibits employees from engaging
in bribery or corruption of any type. The Code of Conduct
expressly prohibits associates from giving gifts to or
accepting gifts from government officials. Associates who
are offered a gift or other item of value that would result
in a violation of Regions' policies are required to
immediately report the incident to the Ethics Program
Manager.
Additionally, to enhance bribery and corruption risk
management, Regions hired an Anti-Bribery and Anti-
Corruption Officer who reports through Financial Crimes
Risk Management. We also instituted an Anti-Bribery and
Anti-Corruption Policy, which requires associates to
comply fully with all applicable anti-bribery laws,
including the Bank Bribery Act and the Foreign CorruptPractices Act. This Policy establishes Regions’
requirements to conduct business activity in an honest
and ethical manner, with a zero-tolerance approach to
bribery and corruption.
Environmental and Social Risks
A discussion of how Regions evaluates environmental
and social risks through our risk management process is
provided in the Advancing Sustainability  section of this
Report. 
Information Security and
Privacy
At Regions, we secure and protect the privacy of personal
and financial information we collect, store, process, and/
or share in a manner that is transparent and consistent
with laws and regulations. We have developed
comprehensive Information Security and Privacy
Programs, which include robust technical, administrative,
and physical controls coupled with policies, processes,
and procedures to help us safeguard information against
unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction and
to protect our information systems against unauthorized
access, use, modification, destruction, loss, misuse, theft,
or denial of service. These programs are regularly
reviewed by senior management and the Board, in
addition to examinations by internal and external
auditors and regulatory agencies who have oversight
authority. 
Our Code of Conduct, Privacy Policy, and Information
Security Policy collectively require confidential treatment
of customer information and reinforce our commitment to
protecting personal and financial data. All associates
(including contracted associates) are required to complete
both the Information Security and Privacy training
courses within 30 calendar days of their start date and
again annually. Associates who have direct contact with
certain data types (e.g., Protected Health Information) are
also required to complete a more detailed training course
on an annual basis. Third-party vendors are routinely
assessed to ensure they have appropriate security and
privacy training, controls, and monitoring in place.
Privacy

associates and is a statement of our commitment to
controlling and mitigating privacy risks. This commitmentCORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX

the highest standards of behavior in all aspects of our
practices. The Privacy Policy is reviewed annually and all
associates (including contracted associates) and third-
party vendors must adhere to this policy. 
In addition, the Regions Privacy Pledge, also referred to as
the privacy notice, is provided to all customers upon
establishing a new consumer relationship or account with
Regions. It explains how we collect, use, and share
information and provides customers with instructions on
how they can limit information sharing with our affiliates
and marketing by Regions through email, phone, and/or
direct mail. We post the Privacy Pledge, along with other
helpful privacy, security, and fraud prevention resources,
on our website.
These privacy programs and policies are overseen by the
Enterprise Privacy Office, which is led by our Privacy
Officer. The Privacy Officer is responsible for ensuring
that:
•Associate training is effective and administered
annually to all associates
•Policies and standards reflect legal and regulatory
requirements
•Effective controls and monitoring exist within the
businesses to mitigate risk
•Procedural and transactional reviews and testing of
businesses are performed routinely to ensure the

Cyber and Information Security
Regions has aligned its information security program with
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity and NIST Special Publication 800-53.
Additionally, we regularly assess threats and
vulnerabilities to our systems, so we can maintain an
appropriate control environment to effectively mitigate
these risks. The Information Security Program includes
layered controls of network intrusion detection and
prevention, enterprise malware protection, advanced
persistent threat monitoring, and data protection
capabilities, and it adopts the philosophy of least
privileged for granting access to our systems. Regions
regularly tests our detection and response capabilitiesthrough annual penetration tests, ongoing vulnerability
scans, and engagement of third-party vendors to perform
red-team testing. The Information Security Program is
subject to multiple internal and external audits, reviews,
and exams annually.
The increasing adoption of technological innovation,
transformation, and interconnectedness has resulted in a
continuing evolution in the cyber threat landscape.
Attacks are becoming more frequent, widespread,
sophisticated, and harder to defend. Ransomware,
internet-wide vulnerabilities, supply chain compromises,
cloud security, mobile malware, politically motivated
attacks, and high-profile data breaches have become
prevalent. Company perimeter defenses and traditional
security controls no longer provide the same level of
protection as they did just a few years ago. A new
approach and vision, ongoing awareness, continuous
adaptation, and effective tools, processes, and
governance are all necessary to ensure that our data and
information systems are protected. Therefore, we
maintain a formal Cyber Incident Response Plan and
Team to evaluate and respond to significant events and
incidents that may impact Regions or our customers.
Additionally, we have placed a computer forensics firm
and an industry-leading consulting firm on retainer in
case of a breach event.
Our Information Security organization is led by our Chief
Information Security Officer (CISO). The CISO develops
and executes an enterprise-wide information security
strategy that helps protect our customers' information,
while also complying with applicable legal and regulatory
standards. As part of this role, the CISO manages the
development, implementation, and maintenance of the
information security infrastructure; oversees the
protection of Regions' electronic assets by providing
monitoring, detection, analysis, event handling, and
containment of security incidents; monitors information
security trends internally and externally; and reports to
senior leadership and the Board about information
security issues and activities affecting the organization.
The Risk Committee of the Board oversees information
technology activities and risks including information
security risk assessment, strategy, policy, and framework,
and disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis
management. In addition, on a regular basis, the Audit
Committee reviews our cyber security risk management
practices, primarily by receiving reports on our cyber
security management program.

Regions strives to remain a leader in the banking industry
and for us, leadership and learning go hand-in-hand.
Continuing education is a critical component of our
culture and we help associates reach higher by providing
opportunities to learn about banking, stay aware of the
risks Regions faces, and understand our responsibilities to
protect our customers and comply with laws and
regulations. 
In addition to job-specific training, we require that all
associates complete mandatory annual courses, called
MAC training. These online training courses are revised in
response to regulatory changes, industry events, and
evolving risks. Completion of MAC training is a condition
of continued employment at Regions; new hires must
complete training within 30 calendar days from their start
date, and then again annually. In addition to the trainings
listed below that are required for all associates, additional
business unit-specific training is required for certain
functions and roles.
248,932 hours  of MAC training
completed by associates in 2018
 
Regions associates completed the following courses in
2018: 
Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes
every associate's responsibility and
accountability in the areas of conflicts of
interest, insider trading/insider information,
incentive program ethics, fair and consistent
treatment, and discrimination and
harassment prevention.
Fair and Responsible Banking  explains the
importance of providing Regions' customers
with a fair and responsible banking
experience. Associates are provided with the
tools to be able to identify key aspects of fair
and responsible banking regulations and
policies and understand their effects on
Regions and our customers, as well as
determine and apply fair and responsible
banking practices. The course also provides
guidelines for avoiding discrimination and
unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices
and properly reporting customer complaints
through the Centralized Customer Complaint
Database.
Fundamentals of Risk Management  reminds
associates how sound risk management
affects our ability to serve our customers and
protect Regions. The course explains the
three lines of defense concept, the
importance of a strong risk culture, and how
shared value helps build that culture.
Financial Crimes: BSA/AML and OFAC  covers
the purpose of the BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act,
and Customer Due Diligence requirements as
they relate to recognizing, reporting,
recordkeeping, and reducing the effects of
financial crimes. In addition, the course
covers OFAC's requirements, how to comply
with OFAC, and Regions' OFAC compliance
strategy.
Information Security  provides associates
with training and information on Regions'
information security and protection strategy.
The course explains user identification and
passwords, personal computers, mainframe,
e-mail, internet and intranet, remote access,
and business recovery.
Privacy explains Regions' Privacy Pledge and
when to provide it to our customers, as well
as the associate's responsibilities related to
customer privacy preferences, which
includes how and when we communicate
with consumers. In addition, this course
discusses the red flags for potential identity
theft and appropriate associate responses.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX

Regions is committed to operating our business
responsibly. We understand that this will help us create
long-term and sustainable value by reducing costs and
risks, increasing revenue, enhancing our reputation,
strengthening our communities, and helping us meet the
expectations of our customers, shareholders, associates,
communities, and future generations. To this end, we
understand we have an opportunity to promote
sustainability and ESG through our interactions with
suppliers and customers and in the types of products and
services we provide. We work collaboratively with our
clients, communities, and other stakeholders to promote
environmentally sustainable and socially responsible
business practices. We also understand that taking into
consideration sustainability factors can reduce our risk
exposure and, simultaneously, allow us to take advantage
of new markets and opportunities.  
Environmental and Social
Risk Management
As a company in the financial services industry, we
acknowledge the unique risks and concerns surrounding
the environmental and community impact of our lending
practices, including climate change. As part of our risk
management process, we have a dedicated industry team,
the Energy and Natural Resources Group (ENRG), that
underwrites exposure to energy and natural resources
clients. The team has a broad and deep understanding of
these industries and their environmental and social
impacts. Our credit policies and procedures require the
involvement of ENRG based on a client’s primary NAICS
code. Certain sectors, such as coal, utilities, and oil and
gas have been identified as requiring heightened due
diligence surrounding environmental and social impact,
compliance with regulations, and other subsector-specific
factors, such as diversification of fuel mix. In addition to
expanded underwriting requirements, elevated approvals
are required from senior credit executives, and these
customers are monitored no less than annually per
Regions' loan policies. 
Regions has also established industry concentration limits
that are approved by the Bank's management-level Credit
Risk Committee. These limits are monitored by the Risk
Analytics team, who report to the Chief Risk Officer.
Industry exposures are measured each quarter and
reported to the Credit Risk Committee to ensure that
industry exposure remains within risk tolerances.Finally, ongoing training of Regions associates ensures
compliance with our stated risk appetite and related rules
and regulations. Various lines of business within the
Corporate Banking Group hold semi-annual calls that
discuss updated industry information, new lending
regulations, or other topical issues related to Regions' risk
appetite. Additional informal training for emerging topics
(such as natural disasters) is handled either by internal
committees or as agenda items for regularly scheduled
line of business meetings.
Coal Mining and Mountaintop Removal
Regions' Energy and Natural Resources White Paper, an
internal document that defines our risk appetite,
identifies many of the heightened environmental risks in
lending to coal mining companies. This document is
updated periodically and reflects Regions' decision to not
lend to companies that use mountaintop removal mining
practices to extract more than 5 percent of their total
annual tonnage. In addition, extensions of credit to coal
companies require enhanced due diligence with respect to
legal and environmental compliance, as well as approval
from Credit Officers within the ENRG approval chain.
Regions manages its coal exposure as part of the Energy
and Natural Resources portfolio, and commitments to
coal companies are reported on a quarterly basis to senior
management. 
Risk Ownership and Awareness 
Environmental and social risk management is also
integrated into our Risk Ownership and Awareness
process—the three lines of defense. 
The first line of defense  (e.g., client managers or debt
product officers) owns and manages the risks that Regions
faces in its day-to-day operations. Environmental and
social risks, such as environmental impact, legal
compliance, and safety issues present in a client's
operations or credit transaction, would be identified by
Regions associates in first line of defense roles. 
The second line of defense  (e.g., credit officers) assesses
risk and oversees the risk-taking activities of the first line
of defense. Second line of defense associates need to
agree with the first line's assessment of risk, including
environmental or impact to the community, before a
transaction can move forward to approval. 
The third line of defense (e.g., audit and credit review)
performs independent reviews and assessments of risk
management practices of the first and second lines of
defense. Regions' specialized and geographic portfoliosCORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX
 2018 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report                                                                                                                       19are examined on a regular basis to ensure compliance
with existing loan and monitoring policies. If
environmental or social issues surface with a client after
the underwriting of a transaction has closed, review by
the third line of defense ensures that such issues receive
an appropriate post-closing evaluation. 
In the event the third line of defense determines that an
action plan must be established to mitigate an identified
risk or operational issue, the first and second lines of
defense are tasked with developing and executing the
plan within a given timeframe. The third line of defense
monitors and audits the actions taken to ensure the
heightened risk has been appropriately mitigated. 
Environmental Policy 
Regions also has a stand-alone environmental policy with
which all commercial loans, including those underwritten
in the specialized portfolio, must comply. This policy sets
requirements for enhanced due diligence, which can
include the completion of an environmental
questionnaire, a government record search, or an
environmental site assessment. The extent of due
diligence required is based on the risks identified during
the underwriting process and the loan value. Regions'
Environmental Risk Manager (or designee) and/or the
Chief Risk Officer or Financial Risk Executive must sign any
transaction that contains an exception to this policy.
Sustainable Financing
The Solar Power Finance team at Regions supports the
development and implementation of clean energy
solutions for our Corporate Banking clients. Since 2016,
Regions has provided capital in the form of sale-
leasebacks to leading developers of utility scale and
commercial photovoltaic (PV) solar projects across the
U.S. By helping bring these projects to market, a portion
of the traditional power supply is offset by carbon-free
generation.
370 MW  in generating capacity
from funded solar projects since 2016
In 2018, we provided $300 million in funding for eight
individual PV solar projects located in Alabama,
California, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington. These
projects consist of ground-mounted PV solar farms, as
well as rooftop- and carport-mounted facilities located at
universities. Overall generating capacity from these solar
projects is 147 megawatts. In addition, the ENRG specializes in tailored financing
products and services for renewable energy projects. Our
offerings include advisory and financing services to
energy companies in conjunction with mergers and
acquisitions, as well as issuances of bonds. The ENRG
works closely with the Solar Power Finance team and
commodities team to raise capital for renewable energy
clients with solutions ranging from highly structured
project finance to standard financing offerings.  
We also provided construction funding to support the
construction of projects and advised clients on green
bond issuances and potential acquisition opportunities.
As our platform continues to grow, we expect to execute
on those bond and advisory opportunities in 2019.  
Responsible Asset
Management
Regions' Wealth Management Group provides individuals
and institutions with products and services to help them
manage and grow their assets. Our Asset Management
team includes the Portfolio Management Group, which
structures and reviews client portfolios; the Investment
Research Group, which selects third-party investment
managers for Regions portfolios; and the Investment
Management Group, which is a registered investment
adviser that manages proprietary fixed income and equity
strategies. These groups oversee $30 billion in combined
assets. In 2018, the Investment Research Group expanded
the products offered by Regions to include two equity and
two fixed income ESG-focused products to our
recommended list.
Added 4 ESG-focused investment products
Sustainable Forestry
In addition, the Natural Resources and Real Estate Group
within Wealth Management manages natural resources
properties held in trusts, estates, and agency accounts. As
one of only a few banks that directly manages land and
timber for clients, Regions demonstrates a commitment
to sustainability and forestry best practices. Relying on a
staff of more than 40 natural resource professionals and
registered foresters, Regions is responsible for the
sustainable management of approximate 1 million acres
of timberland across 15 states. Regions adheres to all
applicable state Best Management Practices (BMPs) for
Forestry. Our forestry management efforts and state BMPsCORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX

sequestration, and wildlife habitat.
In addition to following BMPs, a portion of the timberland
acres managed by Regions' foresters is certified under the
2015-2019 Sustainable Forestry Initiative Standard or the
2015-2020 American Tree Farm Certification Standard.
Both third-party certification systems promote
sustainable forestry practices aimed at protecting water
quality, biodiversity, wildlife habitat, species at risk, and
forests with exceptional conservation value.
Supply Chain
We view our vendors and suppliers of goods and services
as extensions of Regions. We expect that they maintain
our same high standards of integrity, operate responsibly,
and support our mission to create shared value. 
Supplier Diversity 
Regions is committed to increasing supply chain
opportunities for certified diverse suppliers by providing
access to contracting opportunities and supporting
supplier development. The supplier diversity initiative at
Regions focuses on building supply partner relationships
with U.S.-based small and disadvantaged businesses and
those that are owned and controlled by minorities,
women, veterans, disabled individuals, and LGBT
individuals. 
Creating More Opportunities  
In carrying out our day-to-day business, Regions contracts
with thousands of suppliers, many of whom subcontract
goods and services related to the work they perform for
us. Several measures have been incorporated into our
processes to encourage our prime suppliers to create
more subcontracting opportunities for high-performing
diverse business enterprises. We also continually strive to
increase minority supplier spend. In 2018, we expanded
our efforts by launching the Building Your Future Program,
providing business development opportunities to
enhance diverse supplier partnerships.
To learn more about our supplier diversity
program, go to our Supply Partners
webpageVendor Code of Conduct
In early 2019, we adopted a Vendor Code of Conduct,
which reiterates the expectation that vendors adhere to
all applicable provisions of our Code of Conduct. The
Vendor Code of Conduct also sets forth expectations for
working conditions, human rights, ethical business
practices, and environmental conservation. At a
minimum, Regions requires its vendors and their
subcontractors to fully comply with all laws and
regulatory requirements applicable to their business
activities. We emphasize, however, that we seek to do
business with vendors that go beyond legal compliance
and help us achieve our commitments to environmental
and social objectives.
The Vendor Code of Conduct  is available on
our Supply Partners webpage
Human Rights Statement
Honoring and affirming protections for human rights is
embodied in our values and mission. Regions' support of
fundamental rights is also reflected in our policies and in
our everyday interactions with associates, vendors,
customers, and the communities where we do business.
We strive to conduct business in a manner that is
consistent with fundamental human rights principles,
such as those stated in the United Nations Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the International
Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental
Principles and Rights at Work. We are committed to
maintaining a work environment where every associate
at every level is treated with dignity and respect, free
from discrimination and harassment, and can devote
their full attention and best efforts to their job. These
same standards apply to our interactions with
customers and others with whom we do business,
including vendors, contractors, and subcontractors.
Regions expects that the entities we do business with
also respect individual human rights and conduct their
business operations free from human rights abuses,
such as forced or child labor, human trafficking, and
slavery.

We believe that we are only as strong as our associates.
This is why Build the Best Team is part of our strategic
priorities and put people first and enjoy life  are two of
our core values. In order to build that team, it is necessary
for us to identify talent during the recruitment process
and invest in our associates' professional development
once they join Regions. Throughout an associate's career,
we emphasize professional development through
opportunities such as technical, individual, management,
and leadership training programs; formal talent and
performance management processes; and sustainable
career paths. Regions does not want to simply provide
jobs. We are one team, focused on investing in the careers,
lives, and well-being of our teammates.

Associate Engagement
Regions seeks to maintain a culture that best positions us
to attract, engage, develop, and retain top talent that
positively contributes to our culture and our business. A
fundamental component of building the best team is
understanding what parts of our culture drive motivation
and engagement. Engaged associates are our greatest
resource, and the enthusiasm and dedication they bring
to work makes life better for their fellow associates, our
customers, and the communities we serve. Measuring
engagement helps us understand how we can improve
and strengthen our culture and fulfill our mission.
Associate Engagement Survey  
Every year, Regions distributes an anonymous online
Team-Associate Engagement Survey to measure
engagement. Through this survey, associates answer
questions to capture how they feel about their workplace experience at Regions. Anonymous survey results and
resources are provided to managers, who then share the
results with their teams. Teams take time to celebrate the
great things they are already doing and evaluate
opportunities to adopt new practices that will positively
impact their goals and performance. Managers and their
teams collaboratively identify performance goals and the
survey items that can contribute to the attainment of
those goals. By determining a plan of action, as well as
individual ownership of actions, each team is unified in
achieving shared goals. Once the plan is put into action,
teams regularly discuss progress and recalibrate as
needed.
Beginning in 2018, instead of one annual survey,
associates are surveyed twice at different points
throughout the annual review period. This shift in survey
distribution is a new, proactive way to pulse the
engagement of our associates; however, the goal of these
surveys remains the same as in years prior: to create a
strong, more productive workplace that helps teams
create shared value.

The engagement survey itself provides important
benchmarks about associate engagement, but it is
through our leaders and their teams where the real work
of engagement is managed. Regions' leaders receive a
variety of tools and resources to engage their teams. What
we learn from these efforts helps us understand how
engagement impacts associates in different departments
and roles, teamwork, and our overall performance.
Regions has been recognized for our efforts in engaging
associates and building a strong culture through industry
awards. In 2018, Regions received the Gallup Great
Workplace Award for the fourth year in a row. This award
recognizes organizations that embrace engagement and
make it a fundamental foundation of their business.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX

Although associate appreciation takes place throughout the year, Regions specifically honors associates every September
during Evergreen Week. Evergreen Week is a time when managers thank associates for their hard work and dedication,
celebrate how associates work together to deliver the best results in the right way, and show appreciation for associates'
unique talents and contributions to our Company. Each year we develop a new Evergreen theme that guides the activities
for the week. In 2018, the theme was Celebrating Team Regions, and we celebrated what makes Regions strong: a culture
that values integrity, respect, diversity and inclusion; our commitment to teamwork; and our focus on continuous
improvement. All associates also receive an extra day of paid vacation as part of Evergreen Week. 
Better Life Award 
The Better Life Award is the top award given by Regions to associates for outstanding dedication to customers and the
community, as well as job performance. Presented monthly to one associate who lives the Company's values, the award
recognizes an associate who has gone beyond what is required to make life better for others. All associates are eligible to
nominate a coworker—or be nominated—for the award. Our CEO honors recipients at the Company’s headquarters during a
meeting broadcast to all offices. Recipients receive an additional week of paid vacation and a $1,000 donation in their name
made to the nonprofit organization of their choice.

The success of our business depends on people, which is 
why Build the Best Team is one of our most enduring 
strategic priorities. We believe the best teams are diverse 
teams, and we are committed to creating an environment 
where all associates are included and have a sense of 
belonging.
In 2018, to further solidify this commitment, Regions  
created a Diversity and Inclusion Center of Expertise, led 
by our Head of Diversity and Inclusion. The addition of 
this Center is a continued step in building a stronger 
diverse culture that also fosters a sense of inclusion and 
belonging across all levels of our organization. The Center 
is charged with developing and implementing actionable 
programs and initiatives focused on attracting and 
retaining qualified diverse talent, as well as identifying 
and developing our internal diverse talent pipeline. 
Additionally, the Center develops training and  
incorporates best practices to build a culture of inclusion.
In addition to the Center, we continued the efforts of our 
Regions Diversity Network, a cross-section of associates 
from all levels who work together to advance our 
comprehensive diversity strategy and create greater multicultural awareness within Regions. In 2017, we
established Diversity Network chapters in the Midwest,
Texas, and South Florida, and we are preparing to form
new chapters across our footprint in 2019. We are also
focused on education and training around equal
opportunity and diversity and inclusion. These topics are
covered in our required training courses, namely the
Business Conduct and Ethics course and the Respect in
the Workplace course. In addition, managers receive
additional training as part of their Effective and Compliant
Interviewing course and Leading the Regions Way: High
Performance Teams workshop, an instructor-led course
that has a focus on inclusion. We also plan to launch four
e-learning courses in 2019. The first is an all-associate
session that provides a definition of diversity and
unconscious bias, along with examples of best practices
for promoting inclusion. The other e-learning courses are
geared towards managers and focus on unconscious
biases and strategies for recognizing and overcoming
those biases.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is supported
by executive management and associates, and our efforts
are overseen by the CHR Committee. We understand that
our strategic approach to diversity and inclusion is not
only a business imperative; it is the right thing to do.

To further dialogue on diversity and inclusion, Regions
started a new series of candid, topical forums hosted by
our Head of Diversity and Inclusion, Clara Green. One of
the first conversations was with Regions' President and
CEO, John Turner. This conversation was open to all
Regions associates and was broadcast live to Company
offices across our footprint. It reflected how diversity
and inclusion, together, is a key priority for Regions—and
one that is championed by the Company's top leaders.
Throughout 2019, we will use an inclusion observance
calendar as a means to structure many of our inclusion
activities, including future Conversations with Clara. This
is a great way to more deeply understand the things we
have in common as well as those things that make us
different, as we continue to strengthen our culture of
inclusion. 
Recruiting Talent
Our associates are the enablers of our success, and we
seek to recruit a diverse group of talent that shares our
values and mission of making life better. We believe our
associates deserve more than just a job. We offer
performance-driven individuals a place where they can
build a career—a place to expect more opportunities.
One way that we recruit top talent is through the
Emerging Talent Program, an important talent
management tool that sources talent from various
colleges and universities. The program focuses on
localized, experiential development that includes
progress points and ongoing enrichment activities
designed to prepare individuals for future roles in the
organization. Many associates begin their journey by
evaluating their interest in the Company through one- or
two-year internships. When the Company and personal
interests align, associates are offered full-time positions.
In 2019, we plan to expand our efforts to include internal
junior talent for some of our business unit programs. Recruiting for a Diverse Workforce
Regions is committed to hiring candidates with diverse
backgrounds and experience. We make a concentrated
effort to attract diverse talent through various recruiting
initiatives and collaborative efforts. Our Human Resources
team also works closely with organizations to conduct job
readiness presentations, mock interview sessions, and
resume building workshops. 
In 2018, Regions accepted the Bipartisan Congressional
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)
Caucus' Partnership Challenge, which aims to encourage
corporations to make greater investments in HBCUs. Since
making this commitment, Regions has made additional
financial contributions in support of HBCUs and will be
introducing an HBCU recruitment strategy in 2019.
We are also committed to employing veterans and military
members who are seeking opportunities in the financial
services industry. In 2017, Regions made a public
statement of support through the Employer Support of
the Guard and Reserve and issued a separate statement of
support through Military.com in 2018. We also emphasize
recruitment through military-focused career programs,
fellowships, and on-base recruiting, and in 2019, we will
implement a new military transition program.
Looking ahead
In 2019, we plan to launch a new Corporate Alumni
Program, which will increase our ability to stay in touch
with associates who choose to leave or retire. Alumni
will have access to a portal where they can remain
connected to Company news and information. Similarly,
we will attempt to leverage those associates'
experiences with Regions through networking events
and mentoring opportunities. The program will also
serve as a recruitment tool.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX
 2018 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report            25Benefits and Wellness
We believe that supporting our communities begins with
our associates. We strive to make life better for associates
by offering a benefits package that:
Prepares associates for retirement.  Over 90 percent of
Regions associates participate in our 401(k) Plan. For
eligible associates who are not accruing a benefit in the
Regions Financial Corporation Retirement Plan (a defined
benefit plan closed to new participants), we make an
annual 2 percent contribution to their 401(k) Plan,
regardless of whether or not they contribute themselves.
We also match associate contributions and announced an
increase in the match from 4 percent to 5 percent
beginning in 2019.
Supports them in balancing their personal responsibilities
and work life. We provide a range of programs to help
associates and their families get more out of life, including
an employee assistance program, an associate financial
fitness program, tuition reimbursement, dependent
scholarships, adoption assistance, a Company match for
eligible charitable contributions, and TeamGreen Banking,
which provides associates with discounts on home equity
loans, mortgage loans, and other banking services.
Promotes health and wellness.  We provide coverage to
associates working at least 30 hours per week that is both
comprehensive and affordable to them and their families.
Associate health insurance costs are progressively aligned
with compensation so that entry-level associates pay the
lowest available out-of-pocket monthly premium. We also
offer wellness programs and incentives that encourage
healthy choices to all associates.
Provides financial security in the event of disability or
death.  Regions provides both life and disability insurance
to all benefits-eligible associates.Regions invests in associates' well-being by:
Making them retirement ready 
increased Company 401(k) Plan matching
contribution
Supporting parents  
enhanced our family leave benefits
Providing growth opportunities  
focused on career paths and raised the entry-
level wages
Supporting Parents 
We recognize that the birth or adoption of a child can be a
stressful time of transition financially and from a work-life
balance perspective. As a result, we expanded our
parental leave benefits to reflect our commitment to
support our associates and their families. Beginning in
2019, we will provide 12 weeks of fully paid leave for birth
mothers and six weeks of fully paid leave for birth parents,
including domestic partners, and adoptive parents. 
Regions also provides associates with a prenatal wellness
program, Baby Yourself. The service provides expectant
parents with support and educational materials, including
access to a personal nurse that they can call with
questions or concerns throughout their pregnancy. 
Entry-level Wage 
We raised the entry-level wage to $15 an hour over the
course of the year. Benefits of tax reform allowed us to
accelerate our plans to increase wages and make this
investment in our associates sooner than initially
planned. This change benefited approximately 25 percent
of our workforce and represents an investment of more
than $20 million a year in our community economies.

Regions' Talent Management Program assesses the
strengths of our associates and builds talent pipelines for
the future. Through this program, Regions employs a
consistent, continuous approach to talent assessment,
identification, and development. Because we believe
talent management is something that happens every day,
we identify events and actions throughout the year to
prompt assessments, conversations, and feedback. The
most expansive event in our talent management process
is the career check-in. At all levels of the organization,
managers and associates are encouraged, at least
annually, to pause and discuss each associate's career
progression. Associates, who are expected to drive their
career planning, take the first step by completing a guide
and setting time with their manager to have a discussion.
These discussions are unique to each associate and
manager pair, but they provide for an opportunity to drive
collaborative planning and create commitments to
associate development.  
Spreading the talent discussion out over the course of a
year provides the best opportunity for managers to dive
more deeply into the most critical pools of talent within
their organizations. Whether the focus is on emerging
talent, diversity, high/low performers, or high/low
potential associates, each business unit matches their
talent discussions to the needs of the business. Similarly,
succession planning focuses first on the most critical
positions with the greatest possibility for turnover.
Incorporating plans that attempt to match our best suited
talent for our most critical positions allows us to prioritize
our resources and effort into those situations that will
generate the greatest return for our associates, the
organization, and our shareholders.  
In order to best support talent decisions and internal
mobility of talent, managers routinely assess associate
potential, performance, behaviors, competencies, and
skills. Associates play their part in the process by regularly
updating career interests, mobility preferences, training,
education, and certifications. High Performance Teams
Regions' leaders are expected to deliver performance
outcomes through a strengths-based, engagement-
focused, performance-oriented, and inclusive approach to
managing talent. We believe that these four management
principles can inspire true performance growth for
associates, teams, and the Company. 
During 2018 and 2019, people managers will participate in
a one-day Leading the Regions Way: High Performance
Teams workshop that focuses on the management
principles. The course provides a framework for leading
associates in the rapidly changing landscapes of the
workforce and banking. The workshop offers leaders the
opportunity to practice with tools and resources that help
them set expectations, coach effectively, and create
accountability.

Regions is dedicated to skill building and development for
every associate. We understand that to Build the Best
Team, we must not only recruit and retain talent, but also
assist associates with their development and professional
growth.
Associates have the option to develop skills that will help
them grow in their current role or prepare for other roles
that may interest them. Our training programs are
designed to enhance the talent levels of associates by
delivering impactful and timely learning solutions that
contribute to building teams and the Company's growth.

Environment 
Automation, cognitive technologies, and the open talent
economy are reshaping the future of work. While we
recognize the importance of technology to enrich the
customer experience, we believe that our associates
remain our greatest competitive advantage. For this
reason, we continue to invest in our associates so that
they are empowered with the best skills and tools—
including digital technologies—to more efficiently and
effectively meet the needs of our customers. 
We are committed to preparing our workforce for a rapidly
changing environment and understand that reskilling and
upskilling our workforce is crucial to staying competitive
and to retaining valued associates. We implemented
learning solutions intended to help our associates
become future work-ready and to gain the skills they will
need in tomorrow's workplace. The Build the Best Banker
program is a series of learning solutions that prepares
bankers to handle a range of customer transactions, while
helping customers make better financial decisions. Even
as digital capabilities transform our industry and
consumers increasingly conduct transactions through
technology, we believe technology enhances the value of
a personal, trusted relationship between the customer
and a banker. The Build the Best Banker learning journeys
equip bankers to meet the needs of our customers today
and into the future.   Regions' technology associates have access to over 5,000
on-demand courses that offer intensive learning in
application development, IT operations, information
security, and technology architecture. This learning
solution also offers professional development for data
and business professionals. Regions also provides access
to a full suite of courses to almost all associates,
regardless of whether the application is needed in their
current role. In addition to helping our associates become
future work-ready, Regions believes that associates
benefit from being "change-ready" and has developed a
series of courses that address change readiness and
barriers to willingness to change. The series also guides
associates through problem solving and provides a
roadmap and tools for moving through change.  
While Regions has made considerable investments in the
development of our associates, our focus on continuous
improvement has led us to onboard a learning experience
platform that connects learners with opportunities to
acquire more skills for tomorrow's marketplace. This
platform creates an ecosystem of learning resources using
data science and algorithms to provide curated learning
paths that connect associates to Regions' proprietary
content, vendor-provided content, and open source
content. Learning is also based on the associate's critical
skills and role requirements, personal interests, and
career aspirations. This ecosystem allows associates to
build, measure, and communicate their skills. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX

Our core value of focus on your customer  and doing
what is best for them is the foundation for our services.
This approach drives the way we think, how we treat each
other, and the type of service we provide. By consistently
providing superior customer service, we strengthen
loyalty and deliver a better customer experience. 
We have several programs in place to gather feedback
from customers and measure how we serve them. Our

Regions is a relationship bank, and while we are investing
in technology to make banking easier for our customers
and associates, we are also maintaining our customer-
centric approach to banking and ensuring that we
continue to execute on our Regions360 customer needs-
based approach to banking.
Regions360®
Regions360 puts customers' needs at the center of every
interaction and shapes the way we cultivate relationships.
By taking a deliberate, prescriptive approach to
identifying customer needs, our bankers work as a team
to bring customers our best: our best thinking, our best
products, our best services, and our best solutions.
Customers benefit from practical solutions they need and
will use, and Regions benefits from broadening customer
relationships that deliver long-term quality growth.
Regions360 delivers shared value for customers and our
Company because we are doing what is right for
customers and helping them succeed financially by
providing competitive products in a transparent and
trustworthy manner. 
Our bankers bring Regions360 to life every day by: 
•Identifying customers' financial goals and needs
through quality conversations 
•Providing practical and balanced solutions to help
meet those goals 
•Offering financial advice and guidance to help
customers make better financial decisions  
•Introducing expertise by bringing in the right Bank
partners to help meet complex needs with a "one
bank, one team" approach 
•Offering customers the best experience possible
through relationship teams who are committed and
engaged
A New Way to Bank
Technology is having a profound impact on all the
channels that traditional banks provide, including
branches, ATMs, call centers, and web applications. While
more and more customers prefer to do their banking
remotely through digital banking, many still want the
option of talking to a banker at a branch, especially for
more complex needs, such as financial advice and loans.
To adapt to this change, all of our branch associates are
trained through our Build the Best Banker program to
handle the full spectrum of customers' needs and helpthem with a range of transactions, from opening an
account and cashing a check, to applying for a mortgage
and retirement planning. 
Our newly designed branches do away with the teller lines
and instead use private workstations to allow bankers to
engage in more personal conversations with customers,
including discussions about their life and financial goals
and how Regions can help them meet those goals. 
We are also investing in video banking ATMs. Through
these ATMs, customers throughout our footprint can
interact with a live banker. Not only can customers
complete more complex transactions through this service,
but it also extends our banking hours, with video bankers
available until 9 p.m. ET during the week and 6 p.m. ET on
weekends. 
Looking ahead
In 2019, we will launch Bank Your Way, a new approach
aimed at making banking easier for our customers and
ensuring that they know about the services and options
available to them. Bank Your Way focuses on bankers
educating customers—new and existing—about what
we offer and showing them how to use our services on
their mobile device, online, or at our ATMs. It is
designed to capitalize on opportunities that come up
every day in our branches and to use those
opportunities to add value to customers' relationships
by showing them faster and more convenient ways to
meet their needs. For example, instead of simply
offering to process a transaction request for a
customer, our bankers will show the customer options
on how to handle those types of transactions faster and
easier, such as taking the customer through the steps of
depositing a check with Regions' Mobile application.
Fair and Responsible
Banking
Regions customers and communities are at the heart of
our businesses, and we are strongly committed to treating
prospective and existing customers in a manner that is
equitable, transparent, fair, and consistent with consumer
protection laws and regulations. Regions is committed to
offering products and services based on an assessment of
customer needs, and we have prohibitions against
engaging in any acts or practices that are unfair,
deceptive, abusive (UDAAP), or predatory. All Regions
associates are expected to adhere to both the letter and
spirit of fair and equal treatment laws and principles, notCORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX
 2018 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report                                                                                                                       31simply because they are the law, but because fair and
responsible banking principles are built into Regions'
corporate values and it is the right thing to do. Ultimately,
our commitment to fair and responsible banking is a
responsibility of every associate. 
Regions established a Fair and Responsible Lending (FRL)
Policy to which all lines of business are expected to
adhere. Additionally, Regions is strongly committed to
making the financial products and services we offer
available to prospective and existing customers on a fair
and responsible basis. Accordingly, Fair Banking
Compliance, a component of Risk Management, is an
essential part of Regions' business and growth strategies.
Fair Banking Compliance identifies, measures, mitigates,
monitors, and reports compliance with all fair lending
laws and UDAAP . Regions, as part of its overall Compliance
Management Program, works to foster and promote a
culture of compliance with regulatory requirements,
internal policies, and industry guidance impacting
consumer and business products and services.  
All Regions associates are required to complete
mandatory annual training courses related to Fair and
Responsible Banking, Risk Management, Business
Conduct and Ethics, and other topics. All associates have
a responsibility to adhere to Regions' FRL Policy, as well
as to ensure all aspects of the lending process, including
application, underwriting, closing, servicing, and beyond
are executed consistently, fairly, and accurately without
regard to any specific characteristics or basis as
prohibited by law.
Regions' commitment to lend fairly and responsibly is
incorporated throughout the product lifecycle, as well as
in product development, advertising, marketing, training,
and customer assistance programs. Regions also
established credit policies, procedures, and product
guidelines that direct all phases of the lending process,
including mortgage lending, and govern activities such as
pricing, product eligibility, servicing, and other functions
of offering and extending credit.  
Our Mortgage team specifically designed a program to
meet Regions' fair and responsible banking commitment.
This program includes, among other items, a needs-
based, customer-focused strategy designed to ensure
transparency and clarity throughout the loan process. A
new online mortgage application was introduced in 2018,
which, along with the consumer portal, creates increased
efficiencies, allows borrowers to track loan progress, and
assures that borrowers receive the information necessary
to make informed decisions during the origination
process. A communication and training plan was also
developed to ensure all mortgage associates understand
our fair and responsible banking/lending commitment.Fair and Responsible Banking Objectives

Customer Complaint Program
Regions' Centralized Customer Complaint Program is one
of our many Voice of the Customer feedback sources used
to identify opportunities to enhance our products,
services, and the customer experience. This enterprise-
wide program helps us ensure that each individual
customer complaint is addressed, and it also allows us to
identify complaint trends and areas for improvement. Key
components of the program include: 
•A centralized application that is used to record
customer complaints and any actions taken to resolve
the customer's concerns. All associates, regardless of
their role, are trained on the program and have access
and a responsibility to ensure customer complaints
are recorded in the application. 
•A process to ensure every customer complaint is
reviewed for timely and thorough resolution. 
•A centralized team that performs quality assurance
reviews on complaints and serves as an ombudsman
on our customer's behalf. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX

Sales Practices 
A company can be successful in a variety of ways, but how
it achieves that success is just as important as the success
itself. At Regions, our values and our culture serve as the
foundation for how we want to be successful—by listening
to our customers, understanding their needs, and meeting
those needs.
Placing the customer first—before our products or
services—ensures that we are working in their interests
and helping them reach their unique financial goals. This
service-centric culture is reinforced through a series of
checks and balances that makes sure we work in our
customers' best interests.  
Our Consumer Services team ensures that our incentives
and management metrics do not measure outputs that
could have unintended outcomes. Where appropriate, our
bankers only receive incentives for opening accounts that
result in the customer using the account or keeping
required balances. And, for most products, if a customer
closes an account in a predetermined timeframe,
incentive credit is charged back to the associate.
As part of our commitment and corporate value to do
what is right for our customers, our Retail Integrity Team
uses a systematic model and analytics-based review
process to uncover potential deviation from the spirit and
intent of the incentive plan or our approach to meeting
customer needs. We created this Retail Integrity Team
within Consumer Services to continue evolving our banker
oversight program with the changing environment. The
Team is tasked with identifying potential risks and
elevating them for appropriate action. We also use
information from our Centralized Customer Complaint
Program and internal Report It! associate hotline to help
identify potential instances of sales practices not aligned
with our needs-based approach. In addition, all retail
associates—from the branch all the way to Consumer
Banking executives—must complete semi-annual training
on retail integrity. Completion and attestation of this
training is required for associates to participate in the
incentive plan.  
In 2017, we created the Office of Associate Conduct, which
partners with businesses and support groups to ensure
the Bank's business practices and behavioral actions are
aligned with our cultural values and beliefs. This team
develops tools and processes to prevent, detect, report,and remediate inappropriate associate behavior while
also serving as a central point of control to ensure
coordination and effective investigative procedures occur
within groups across the Bank.
Expanding Access Through
Financial Inclusion
The financial needs of the communities that Regions
serves are as diverse as the tools required to meet those
needs. Regions has displayed a commitment to providing
all customers—from the unbanked and underbanked to
the very wealthy, and from small businesses to corporate
clients—access to the preferred financial tools, industry-
leading products, and expert advice and guidance. 
Reaching the Unbanked and
Underbanked 
According to the 2017 Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation's Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked
Households , there are 8.4 million unbanked households
(where no member of the household has a bank account)
and 24.2 million underbanked households (where the
household uses a combination of bank products and
alternative financial services) in the United States. To
serve this population within our footprint, Regions has
created an innovative way to provide unbanked and
underbanked customers access to alternative financial
services from a trusted financial institution, at a lower
cost, while offering a pathway to becoming fully banked.
This unique commitment to financial inclusion has made
Regions a leader among financial institutions.  
For millions of households, managing their money means
using cash-based alternative financial services. With
Regions Now Banking®, we offer these services without
requiring an account relationship. Once enrolled, Regions
Now Banking customers have access to services such as
prepaid cards, check cashing, money remittances, in-
person bill payments, and money orders. In addition,
Regions Now Banking customers can take advantage of
Regions financial education and other tools.
Regions Now Banking helps customers take control of
their finances and reach their goals using products and
services of their choice—with the service, security,
strength, and stability of a reputable and trusted financial
partner like Regions.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX

than simply having services available. It is critical for
Regions to build trust with customers who may feel
intimidated by, or suspicious of, banks. Regions associates
are trained to understand and empathize with the
unbanked customer. As part of our needs-based
conversation process, associates explain how the Regions
Now Banking products can meet various customer needs,
as well as other services that can help the formerly
unbanked customer. At the same time, Regions Now
Banking products are subject to rigorous internal
compliance and risk oversight. 
The Regions Now Banking customer segment is one of the
fastest-growing within the Company, and it includes both
previously unbanked consumers and existing Bank
customers using Regions Now Banking services. There are
approximately 600,000 active Regions Now Banking
households. Roughly 20 percent of customers whose first
relationship with Regions is cultivated through Regions
Now Banking go on to open a traditional deposit account
within 12 months of enrollment.

A Day in the Life of an Unbanked Customer
In 2018, Regions associates participated in a workshop
on "A Day in the Life of the Unbanked Customer." This
workshop challenged participants to complete a variety
of financial transactions without using a bank or bank
account. Teams were given a check to cash, a list of
financial tasks, and two hours to complete them.
By conducting real world transactions just as an
unbanked customer would, these associates gained
insights and empathy for consumers and the challenges
they face managing money. Afterwards, associates
shared their experiences and observations. They
discussed how Regions Now Banking compared to using
a non-bank provider. And lastly, they brainstormed ways
they could use this experience in their day-to-day jobs. 
Regions Now Banking has opened new
opportunities for customers and

Homeownership 
For many, homeownership is an important financial
milestone—one that Regions is committed to helping our
customers achieve. As part of Regions360, our mortgage
originators partner with other Bank associates to provide
advice, guidance, and education so our customers can
make the best financial decisions. In 2018, as part of our
recent organizational changes, the Mortgage originating
team joined the Bank's retail branch network in the
Consumer Bank. This strategic move increased marketing,
educational, and management resources to our
originating team to optimize our execution of Regions360
within the communities we serve.
Our Mortgage team supports homeownership in our
emerging markets by offering a variety of products,
including affordable mortgage products, which seek to
meet the specific needs of low- and moderate-income
borrowers. Through our own Affordable Mortgage suite of
products, Regions provides these borrowers the
opportunity to become homeowners with as little as $500
down, based on borrower eligibility, without the added
cost of mortgage insurance. 
In 2018, a year in which the mortgage industry
experienced lower purchase-money origination volume
than in 2017, Regions increased origination of itsCORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX

Affordable Mortgage suite of products, Regions offers
other low down payment programs that are available
through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing
Administration (FHA), the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA), US Department of Agriculture (USDA/Rural Housing),
and numerous state bond programs. In all, Regions’ total
affordable loan production in 2018 was $808.8 million,
which represented 17 percent of our total mortgage
production. 
Regions' Mortgage CRA Playbook  formalizes processes
and clarifies expectations to drive and monitor superior
performance. Our Emerging Markets and Affordable
Lending Strategy Workgroup reviews our market-specific
CRA plans, assesses results and initiatives, discusses
affordable lending production results and fair lending
regulatory updates, and reviews our product guidelines to
ensure we are maximizing lending opportunities in
emerging markets. 
Further, understanding that unexpected life events can
happen, such as the devastation caused by Hurricanes
Florence and Michael, our Mortgage servicing team
prioritizes the retention of homeownership by keeping our
customers in their homes and offering repayment
assistance to customers experiencing temporary or
unexpected financial hardships.

Regions recognizes the role that small businesses play in
supporting economic development and job creation, and
we are committed to providing the tools and support,
including financial education, that will allow their
business to grow and move forward. As part of our
Regions360 approach to banking, our bankers provide
small business customers with advice, guidance, and
education and work to understand and uncover their
needs in order to provide them with the best products and
services to meet their financial goals. Regions provides a
variety of small business financing options, starting with
loans as low as $5,000. 
Inner City Capital Connections
Regions supports small businesses through our
partnership with Inner City Capital Connections (ICCC). In
2018, Regions and community partners brought three no-
cost business training programs to approximately 250
business owners in Memphis, Atlanta, and Tampa.
Through these programs, entrepreneurs in or near urban
or economically underserved communities received
business training, insights on management and
marketing, and one-on-one coaching to strengthen their
businesses. ICCC training is provided by noted business
school professors, leaders in the fields of management
and finance, and our bankers. Customized coaching is also
delivered by local professionals whose expertise can help
small-business owners develop strategies to reach more
customers and, over time, create more jobs. We have been
a major sponsor of ICCC programs since 2014.

Financial Wellness Seminars
Through the Regions Next Step Elevate program, our
bankers conduct financial education seminars and
provide other solutions for businesses seeking to foster
the financial wellness of their employees, all at no cost to

Our commitment to the communities where we live and
work reflects our mission to make life better and create
shared value for our customers, associates, shareholders,
and the communities we call home. We bring that mission
to life by investing our time and resources in programs
that bring our customers and communities closer to
achieving their financial goals.
In 2018, building on our legacy of community support, we
laid important groundwork for a purpose-led and
performance-driven approach to community
engagement. We formed the Corporate Responsibility and
Community Engagement team to address local
community development needs and promote inclusive
economic growth. This team brings together Community
Affairs; Government Affairs and Economic Development;
Corporate Communications; Fair and Responsible
Banking; and Service Quality and Regions360. Working
together, these groups build on a legacy of community
support to address issues that matter most to our
customers, associates, community partners, lawmakers,
and regulators. The synergy created by this team allows us
to effectively achieve our mission.
As an organization, we are committed to helping
individuals, families, and businesses overcome barriers to
their financial success. To more effectively address these
barriers, we are focusing our community investments in
three engagement priorities that not only address
community and customer needs, but also align with the
skills and talents of our associates and the core values of
our Company: 
Economic and community development
Education and workforce readiness
Financial wellness
These same priorities are used to guide grantmaking by
the Regions Foundation, which Regions has endowed with
$100 million since 2017.
By leveraging all the tools at our disposal—and
concentrating on the areas where we can have the most
meaningful and measurable impact—we are well-
positioned to continue doing more today and into the
future.

Community Development
GoalRevitalize low- and moderate-income
neighborhoods and assist communities with
affordable housing, job creation, and small
business development.
2018 Highlights
•In 2018, Regions invested approximately $4.9 billion in
community development, including $1.3 billion in CRA-
qualified community development lending, $248 million
in CRA-qualified community development investments
(1), $9.6 million in CRA-qualified community
development contributions, and $3.4 billion in small
business and small farm lending.
•Focused on building a strong and diverse
entrepreneurial ecosystem, Regions provides financing
and resources for small businesses. In 2018, we fostered
entrepreneurial growth through sponsorship of Inner
City Capital Connections seminars and the A.G. Gaston
Economic Empowerment Conference.
•Regions is one of the nation’s leading direct investors in
affordable housing, made possible through the federal
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program. In 2018, we
invested more than $275 million in tax credit
partnerships, supporting 31 developments that provide
2,505 units of affordable housing.
Making Life Better for Seniors
In Houston, Regions partnered with a developer to
provide a multi-layered affordable housing investment
to build a 144-unit mixed income senior residence. The
development will deliver 115 affordable housing units
and 29 market rate units, creating a safe, affordable, and
comfortable place for seniors in the aftermath of
Hurricane Harvey and related flooding that damaged
many homes in the Houston area. 
In New York, Regions supported the development of the
first affordable housing community in the Bronx geared
toward helping the senior LGBT population. In
partnership with non-profit organizations, HELP USA and
SAGE, the 82-unit building will provide affordable
housing in an LGBT-welcoming environment, with 26
units set aside for homeless individuals. SAGE will offer
residents assistance programs and community outreach,
as well as case management services for the residents of
the 26 homeless units. The building will also feature an
integrated solar array and energy efficient construction.
Education and
Workforce Readiness
GoalIncrease access to opportunities through
programs that strengthen education quality,
advance teacher training, increase K-12th grade
student competency, foster college success, and
build workforce skills.
2018 Highlights
•Regions invested in workforce training programs to help
youth and adults enter high-demand sectors. This
includes financial support for partners like Jeremiah's
Hope Academy to train low- and moderate-income
individuals in entry-level healthcare careers and to
assist them in securing employment within three
months of graduation. In addition, Regions partnered
with Birmingham Can Code to offer four free week-long

in Charlotte and JA Finance Park in Nashville.
Combining in-class learning with a day-long visit to one
of these simulated towns, K-12th grade students get the
chance to operate banks, manage restaurants, write
checks, and vote for mayor. Through experiential
learning, students can connect the dots between what
they learn in school and what happens in the real world. 
•Through a partnership with Scholastic Inc., Regions
provides K-8th grade math and money curriculum for
teachers, as well as parent and family resources. In
2018, our microsite, Next Step Adventures in Math, had
over 50,000 visitors and nearly 15,000 curriculum
downloads. 
•Celebrated during Black History Month, the annual
Regions Riding Forward® Scholarship Essay Contest
allows students to submit essays about inspirational
African-Americans. Over the contest's eight years,
Regions has awarded more than $1 million in
scholarships to over 200 high school and college
students. In 2018, 30 winners, selected from over 7,000

Regions Next Step®
At Regions, financial education is a meaningful way we
deliver on our commitment to make life better for our
customers, associates, and communities. By offering
advice, guidance, and tools that meet the needs and
aspirations of our associates, customers, and
communities, we help people see a world where money
is viewed as a vehicle for moving life forward. 
In 2018, we branded our financial education program as
Regions Next Step to position the financial education
work being done Company-wide under one common
name. With such a broad corporate scope, it was
important to connect our many different programs and
audiences under a unifying umbrella.
Through a holistic approach, Regions provides advice
and guidance to students from kindergarten through
college, as well as adults in a variety of life stages and
income levels. In addition, we have resources specific to
large and small businesses. Through Regions Next Step
Elevate, a workplace financial wellness program,
Regions provides no-cost, on-site seminars to help the
participating companies' employees chart an action-
oriented path toward their financial goals. 
Strategically, financial education is managed as a shared
service, which provides the right message to the right
audience at the right time through the right channel. In
addition, our strategy addresses the different modalities
of learning by providing digital audio and visual tools, in-
person workshops, self-guided learning, and
opportunities to talk one-on-one with a banker in all our
branches. 
We are also continuing to build on our program and are
planning to provide more online resources on our
website, including podcasts; expand the workplace
financial education workshops; and launch a financial
education webinar strategy.

Community Outreach 
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is reinforced
through our ongoing efforts to reflect, anticipate, and
adapt to the changing demographics of the communities
where we live and work.
We partner with national organizations to provide
financial education programs to diverse communities.
These organizations include Historically Black Colleges
and Universities, the United Negro College Fund, Kappa
Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.,
and the Louisiana NAACP . By combining our partners'
community networks with Regions' financial expertise, we
are able to help hundreds of youth and adults plan their
next step toward financial wellness.
Additionally, we advocate for the needs of people with
disabilities through accessible bank solutions and
investments that help our communities overcome
financial barriers. Regions' Disability Services and
Outreach Manager maintains relationships with advocates
for accessibility, staying abreast of their concerns, and
working alongside internal Regions partners. Our
commitment includes raising awareness of autism
spectrum disorder and creating an autism-friendly
environment in our branches. Furthermore, we focus on
investing in programs that promote independent living
and that increase access to job readiness and
employment through partners like the Disability Rights
and Resource Center in Birmingham, Indiana School for
the Blind, and Paraquad in Missouri. 
Regions also seeks to serve members of the U.S. military
and their families through targeted financial guidance and
education. Regions' Service Members and Veterans Affairs
Manager understands their unique needs and seeks ways
to help them stay in financial control. This includes
providing financial support, job readiness training, and
opportunities to cultivate entrepreneurial activities for
partners like H.E.R.O.E.S. Care in Missouri, Heroes First
Foundation in Georgia, and the Veterans Business
Initiative of the Central Florida Disabilities Chamber of
Commerce.Diversity Advisory Council
Regions' external Diversity Advisory Council is comprised
of various academic, community, and business leaders
and provides objective outside perspective and
guidance on diversity-related matters. Specifically, the
Council supports the Company by: 
  Offering advice, counsel, and feedback regarding
the strategic direction of the Bank's external
diversity and inclusion initiatives and programs  
  Enhancing Regions' brand by participating in
external community engagement efforts and
diversity-focused business development 
  Providing strategic counsel regarding the Bank's
engagement with non-profit and community
organizations as needed
Associate Volunteerism 
Regions associates come to work every day motivated to
meet the needs of our customers, help our neighbors, and
live by our core value to enjoy life . Associates have an
opportunity to participate in our Share the Good®
program, where local markets identify creative and
meaningful volunteer service opportunities. Regions also
honors our associates' commitment to service by offering
paid volunteer time through our What A Difference A Day
MakesSM program and matching their financial gifts to
community organizations focused on education, arts, and
culture.
10,000  financial education volunteer
hours donated by our associates
In 2018, our associates contributed approximately 56,000
hours of community service, including teaching financial
education seminars, tutoring and mentoring students,
building and beautifying affordable homes, and serving
on nonprofit boards. This includes over 10,000 financial
education volunteer hours, part of which are 5,000 hours
in Junior Achievement classroom activities. Our work with
Junior Achievement has resulted in Regions again
receiving a Bronze-level U.S. President's Volunteer Service
Award.
In addition to their time and talent, our associates also
support their local United Way agencies. In 2018, our
associates pledged over $4 million to United Way to help
solve critical social, health, and economic issues in our
communities.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX

Regions recognizes the environmental challenges that
face our planet and is committed to reducing our
environmental footprint and reporting on our progress. To
support this commitment, we adopted an Environmental
Sustainability Policy Statement and environmental goals.
We also enhanced the disclosure of our environmental
performance metrics and provide this information, going
back to 2008, at the end of this section.

Real estate portfolio optimization
To help us implement the policy statement, we assembled
a cross-departmental Environmental Working Group that
reports to executive leadership. The working group's
objectives are to: (1) identify and develop priorities for the
Company's environmental initiatives; (2) promote
awareness and engage with associates on sustainability,
resource conservation, and recycling; and (3) identify
internal and external partnerships and collaborations to
help advance our environmental efforts. The Environmental Sustainability Policy Statement
highlights our commitments to: 
ü Reducing emissions and energy use
ü Assisting in the transition to a low-carbon
economy
ü Conserving resources and reducing waste
ü Promoting awareness and engagement
ü Reporting and transparency
The  Environmental Sustainability Policy
Statement  is available on our Corporate
Governance webpage
Energy and Emissions
Since 2008, Regions has focused on reducing the
Company's energy consumption and greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions through operational efficiencies, real
estate portfolio optimization, and deployment of high-
impact energy reduction projects. We are continuing to
focus on these efforts and are evaluating additional
efficiency and renewable energy opportunities to help us
meet our 2023 goals. 
We also introduced a new approach to branch
renovations, in which we take a holistic approach to
evaluating energy and water efficiency needs in branches
that have been identified as poor-performing sites or are
scheduled for renovations. In addition to standalone
energy reduction initiatives, projects that are generally a
part of these renovations include the installation of
rooftop solar, web-based HVAC controls, LED lighting and
controls, and irrigation monitoring and controls.
Better Buildings Challenge
In 2018, we joined the Atlanta Better Buildings Challenge,
an effort by the U.S. Department of Energy to promote
energy efficiency in commercial buildings with a 10-year
goal of reaching 20 percent energy use reduction by 2020.
Members of the Challenge commit to setting energy goals,
developing innovative energy efficiency resources, and
adopting advanced cost-effective technologies and
practices. As part of this partnership, we entered 21
branches in the Atlanta area. Eleven of these branches
were recognized for already exceeding the 20 percent
energy savings targets. In 2019, we plan to expand this
initiative by joining the national Better Buildings
Challenge and focusing on branches across our footprint.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX

Reducing Transportation Emissions 
While transportation is not a significant contributor to our 
overall greenhouse gas emissions, we recognize that we 
need to do our part in reducing these emissions. Regions 
uses approximately 200 vehicles for corporate and branch 
security, to service Bank facilities, and to operate the  
employee shuttle service at our Birmingham office 
complexes. We continue to identify opportunities to 
reduce fuel use through more efficient routes and service 
frequencies. Further, the use of web-based controls for 
HVAC systems is expected to help us reduce branch visits 
and travel by allowing for remote management.  
In addition, in 2018, we launched an initiative to reduce  
associate non-client business travel by 40 percent.  
Because collaboration and meeting as a team are 
important, we invested in video-teleconferencing 
technology that allows associates to easily hold virtual 
meetings. This initiative is expected to reduce our  
business travel Scope 3 emissions.
We also installed electric vehicle charging stations at our  
large Birmingham and Nashville campuses to help provide 
the infrastructure for electric vehicles. We currently have 
14 charging ports that are available to approximately 
4,500  associates, and we are evaluating expanding this 
program to other areas within our footprint. 
Furthermore, associates in the Birmingham area have the  
opportunity to participate in CommuteSmart, a Regional
 
Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham initiative 
aimed at helping alleviate traffic congestion and reduce 
air pollution. Associates' participation in this program 
during 2018 reduced miles traveled by almost 400,000, 
saving 14,000 gallons of fuel and 221 metric tons of CO2e.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX
 2018 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report   41OperationsResource Use and Waste
We are committed to reducing the environmental
footprint associated with the use and disposal of office
materials. We are continuing to focus on our recycling
efforts, but we are also investing in technology to help us
reduce our overall reliance on paper and other resources.
Paper
We are continuously reviewing opportunities to reduce
the usage of paper in our offices and in our interactions
with customers. Our main focus areas are: (1) reducing
associate printing and (2) transitioning customers to
online banking and digital delivery of documents and
statements. 
Paper Consumption Metrics
39%  reduction in internal copy paper use since 2014
66%  of accounts use electronic statements
81 million  sheets saved annually from electronic
statements
1.18 million  eSignature transactions completed
All data as of December 31, 2018.
To reduce associate printing, we launched a print
optimization program that reviewed overall printing
needs and identified opportunities to reduce printing. In
addition, we use a managed print program, which
defaults computers to non-color, double-sided printing
and requires that associates release the print job at a
network printer. If a print job is not released within 24
hours, it is automatically deleted by the print
management solution. 
In 2018, we launched a Branch Operations Simplification
project that looked at 111 operational tasks completed in
branches to identify opportunities to centralize, eliminate,
or simplify the process. The purpose of this project was to
make banking easier for our associates and increase
efficiency; however, it also resulted in significant
reductions in printing, as it eliminated various paper logs
and reports through automation and centralization.
Overall, this process resulted in annual savings of 5 million
sheets of paper.To reduce the amount of paper used in interactions with
our customers, we updated our account process and
implemented eSignature capabilities. This allows
customers to electronically review and sign most deposit,
lending, and treasury management documents and elect
to receive their copies electronically—saving the customer
time, reducing the amount of paper printed, and securely
delivering and storing sensitive documents. 
We will continue to integrate this new technology
throughout our businesses, having already launched it in
all branch locations, Mortgage, Treasury Management,
Private Wealth, and in our Contact Center. In the coming
year, we expect to expand the use of eSignature into other
customer-facing areas and products, improving efficiency
and speed of service, while reducing material waste. 
We are also reducing paper used for marketing materials,
focusing on consolidating or eliminating brochures and,
where appropriate, transitioning to digital materials. 
Recycling 
When reducing use is not an option, we strive to divert
waste from landfills through recycling. Our confidential
waste program is our most widespread recycling program,
resulting in more than 10 million pounds of paper and
other confidential materials being recycled in 2018.

(1) 2017 is the first year that we included confidential waste that is associated
with clean out projects (e.g., stored records that were destroyed due to office
closures). The 2017 figure includes an additional 874,000 pounds of waste
related to these projects and 2018 includes an additional 711,000 pounds.
Beyond paper and confidential materials, recycling for
bottles and aluminum, as well as other recyclable waste,
is provided in our large operations centers, corporate
headquarters, and in some branches. Approximately 30
percent of associates have access to these recycling
services. We are working to expand our recycling
capabilities and are also engaging our associates on
proper methods of recycling to reduce contamination
rates. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX
 2018 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report            42Electronic Waste
Regions understands the impact that electronic waste has
on the environment and communities; therefore, we strive
to reuse electronic equipment whenever possible. In 2018,
we redeployed 757 computers internally and resold 1,075
pieces of IT hardware. When reuse or resale is not feasible,
we recycle using approved hardware recycling vendors
that are Sustainable Electronics Recycling International
R2:2013 Standard certified. By using certified vendors, we
ensure that our electronic waste is properly managed and
that valuable raw materials are recovered and reused.
Through this program, Regions recycled approximately
17,661 pieces of IT hardware. 
In addition, we held three associate electronic waste
recycling events in our Birmingham campuses, resulting
in 2,977 pounds of associates' personal electronic waste
being recycled. Not only does this permit associates to
properly dispose of unwanted electronics, but it also
provides an opportunity for us to engage our associates
on the topic sustainability.
Looking ahead
At our Birmingham campuses, we have three cafeterias
that serve roughly 4,000 associates daily. We are
engaging with the service provider to identify
opportunities to (1) reduce food waste and the waste
associated with single-serving food and beverage
containers and (2) provide more sustainable, healthy,
and local food options.
We are also engaging our associates on sustainability
and encouraging them to be mindful of their
environmental footprint. In 2019, we will be supporting
the development of local, associate-led Green Teams
throughout our footprint. While some of these groups
have already formed organically, the Environmental
Working Group will provide the Green Teams with tools
and resources to allow for successful implementation of
their sustainability efforts.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX

(1) The associates, real estate, and annual revenue metrics may not match those reported in Regions' financial statements, as prior years' associate count and
annual revenue have not been adjusted in financial statements to reflect divestment of businesses. For the purpose of measuring our environmental footprint, we
did not use the adjusted metrics. Real estate square footage is only for areas where Regions is responsible for paying utilities and has operational control over the
space. In 2018, this segment of real estate accounted for about 85% of Regions' real estate portfolio.
(2) Regions did not start using full-time equivalent until 2015. The 2008 metric is based on total headcount, which reflects active full-time and part-time associates.
(3) Based on real estate square footage where we are responsible for paying utilities and have operational control over the space.
(4) 2017 is the first year that we included confidential waste that is associated with clean out projects (e.g., stored records that were destroyed due to office
closures). The 2017 figure includes an additional 874,000 pounds of waste related to these projects and 2018 includes an additional 711,000 pounds.
(5) Increase in Scope 1 emissions and energy consumption is due to colder temperatures experienced in 2018 that resulted in an increased use of natural gas,
which is primarily used for heating.
(6) 2018 is the first year that we calculated business travel emissions. Information prior to 2018 is incomplete as it was not collected by our vendor. For part of the
rental vehicle emissions, we were only able to collect emissions for 2018 4th quarter. To estimate full-year emissions, we multiplied that quarter's emissions by 4.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT GRI CONTENT INDEX
