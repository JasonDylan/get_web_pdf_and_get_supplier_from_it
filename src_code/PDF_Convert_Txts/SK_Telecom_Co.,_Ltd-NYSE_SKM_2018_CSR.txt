In 2018, SK Telecom posted KRW 16,874 billion in revenue and KRW 
1,201.8 billion in operating proﬁt according to its consolidated ﬁ-
nancial statements based on International Financial Reporting Stan-
dards15 (IFRS15). The revenue volume inevitably declined due to an increase in discount rates of selective contracts implemented 
in September 2017, the impacts of the customer value innovation 
program, and the application of the IFRS15 standards, but the com-
pany partially offset the decline thanks to the positive results of the 
new ICT business portfolio such as media, security. Operating proﬁt 
also fell 21.8% YoY due to a decline in mobile service revenues. 
However, the company achieved meaningful results such as the 
least marketing spending over the last 10 years and an improve-ment in the proﬁtability of 11st. Net income stood at KRW 3,132 
billion, up 17.9% from the previous year, thanks to an increase in 
equity-method gains from SK Hynix. In 2018, capital expenditure 
was efﬁciently spent within the KRW 2.13 trillion guidance through reducing investments in existing infrastructure, in spite of network 
investments in preparation for 5G commercialization.

SK Telecom is seeking to build an effective business portfolio that can maximize corporate value by maintaining the stability of the 
wireless telecommunications business and further take into account 
the growth potential of the new ICT business, as well as increasing 
corporate value through an increase of non-telecommunications 
business value. SK Telecom has raised its dividends since 2015, 
paying a dividend of KRW 10,000 per share including an interim 
dividend of KRW 1,000. SK Telecom is pursuing a stable dividend 
policy that takes into consideration not only the current year but 
also mid- to long-term cash ﬂows.

In 2018, SK Telecom laid the foundation for taking the lead in 5G 
commercialization and raised customer trust as the No. 1 telecom 
operator in the MNO divison through customer value innovation. 
In the non-telecommunications sector we laid the foundations for 
a self-sufﬁcient ICT Synergy Company by completing our business 
portfolio of three core business divisions: media, security, and 
commerce.
The MNO Division  focused on customer value innovation programs 
to recover customer trust and lay the foundation for long-
term growth instead of short-term and exhaustive marketing 
competition. Amid pressure for tariff discounts, we restructured 
the membership, roaming, and price plans with a focus on boosting 
customer convenience. As a result, the division achieved tangible 
results such as achieving the highest customer satisfaction rate 
for 22 consecutive years, the lowest-ever churn rate, as well as 
improvements in customer awareness, uptake in service use, and 
reduction in number of complaints to the VOC department. It also 
made thorough preparations in infrastructure and technology in 
order to commercialize 5G services. In June 2018, at the 5G spectrum 
auction, SK Telecom secured Block C, which will allow SK Telecom 
to respond quickly to expanding demand of 5G services, due to 
attributes of less interference from neighboring bands and high 
expansion potential. On December 1st, SK Telecom, in cooperation 
with Samsung Electronics, succeeded in making the ﬁrst 5G call, 
which showcased SK Telecom’s contribution to the establishment 
of 5G technology standards and the promotion of commercialization 
by continuing its technical cooperation and strategic alliance with 
global ICT companies. The Media Division  achieved the highest performance ever by 
accelerating its growth via both quantitative and qualitative means. 
The IPTV service continued to grow steadily, with revenue growth 
of more than 20% YoY thanks to a continuing uptake in subscribers 
and content revenue growth. The number of subscribers climbed 
8% to 4.73 million and the proportion of premium service UHD 
subscribers exceeded 50%. The mobile video platform ‘oksusu’ 
continued to grow with the number of its subscribers rising to 9.73 
million thanks to growing demand for mobile media content. 
The Security Division  built a convergence security portfolio with 
capabilities in analysis and AI-based security technology by taking 
over ADT Caps, the No. 2 physical security company in Korea and 
merging it with NSOK and acquiring SK Infosec, the No. 1 information 
security company in Korea, after the acquisition of IDQ, the world’s 
No. 1 quantum cryptographic telecommunications company based 
in Switzerland at the beginning of 2018. The integrated corporation 
of ADT Caps that positioned itself as a security service provider with 
a market share of over 30% contributed to SK Telecom’s ﬁnancial 
results as a new growth engine beginning in the 4th quarter of 
2018.
In the Commerce Division , 11st made improvements in proﬁtability 
as its annual revenue maintained at a similar level to 2017 while 
operating loss decreased by more than a half compared to the 
previous year. 11st succeeded in attracting KRW 500 billion from 
external investment and, in September, was spun off from SK Planet. 
On November 11, 2018, ‘11 Day,’ the online retailer achieved a new 
record of KRW 102 billion, the industry’s highest daily transaction 
amount, showing the possibility of becoming the No.1 e-commerce 
company.287/22.

In 2019, SK Telecom will pursue full-ﬂedged growth as an ‘ICT Synergy Company’ by strengthening synergies among the four major 
business divisions of MNO, media, security and commerce based on 5G and AI. SK Telecom plans to realize operating revenue, up 6 % YoY, 
with the revenue guidance set at KRW 18,000 billion on a consolidated basis in 2019. The revenue of non-telecommunications divi sions, 
which accounted for 25% in 2018, are expected to grow to 30-40% in 2019 thanks to the accelerated growth of the media business to be

In 2019, the MNO Division will continue to change and innovate 
while ensuring that its efforts will pay off. Although it is expected 
that negative revenue growth will be inevitable due to continued 
effects from tariff discounts in 2019, the revenue decline has slowed 
down since the second half of 2018. In 2019, the division expects to make a turnaround in revenue in the second half based on growth 
momentum such as increase in handset subscribers, improvements 
in ARPU followed by an increase in customers’ demand for data, 
creation of new 5G business models, and successful expansion into 
the B2B business area. 
In addition, we will not be complacent with the achievements of a 
customer value innovation program last year and will emphasize 
customer-oriented changes and innovation by developing the program into ‘Customer Value Innovation’ in 2019. Furthermore, we 
will lay the groundwork for sustainable growth by focusing on three 
areas - new services, customized beneﬁts for customers, and the 
creation of social value. 
Service innovation based on artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and digital 
transformation (DT) is also one of our key strategic directions for 
2019. We will create an opportunity for customers and companies 
to enjoy win-win growth by discovering individual needs through 
three-dimensional analysis of customer data and real-time 
prediction-based marketing.
In this way, the MNO business will prepare to successfully  maintain 
its current leadership in the 5G era as both SK Telecom’s anchor 
business and the leader of New ICT business – the MNO business 
will evolve full-scale into a service provider while achieving hyper-
gap in the core area of networks.

In the 5G era, competition in the media industry will heat up in the 
mobile sector. Evolving networks will drive up the consumption 
of high-quality media content and create new forms of content 
consumption including live channels, personal broadcasting, VOD 
services and OTT (Over-the-Top) originals. Already, global OTT 
services are entering the Korean market in earnest. SK Telecom 
decided that it was time to decisively invest in K-content in order 
to improve the quality of its media business. In January 2019, SK ACCOUNTABILITY FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OUR BUSINESS OF VALUE CREATION MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW
Telecom decided to launch an integrated corporation between POOQ, an OTT alliance of Korea’s three terrestrial broadcasters, and 
oksusu. The company is planning to transfer the oksusu business 
unit from SK Broadband to the three broadcasting companies and 
secure a stake in the integrated corporation through a capital 
increase by issuing new stocks. The integrated corporation to be 
launched in the future will zero in on expanding investment in high-
quality original content that can be provided in a 5G environment 
based on oksusu subscribers, the unique content of terrestrial TV 
broadcasters, and SK Telecom’s technology.
In order to overcome the limitations of IPTV platforms in 2019, 
competition will intensify with the forging of partnerships 
and alliances between operators and services. In this market 
environment, we will focus on securing competitiveness to grow 
home-based media services into core services in the 5G era. The 
Korean pay-TV market is being recreated with a focus on the 
IPTV services of three telecommunications companies thanks to 
the expansion of subscribers and the growth of paid content. SK 
Telecom is taking steps to acquire the second-largest cable TV 
provider, t-broad, through SK Broadband, and integrate t-broad’s 
business with SK Telecom’s business. Through such strategic 
business integration, SK Telecom, which secured subscribers that 
can consume original content by expanding a pay TV subscriber 
pool with OTT service operators, will accelerate the growth of the 
domestic media market, contributing to the vitalization of media 
ecosystems in Korea.

Revenue in the security business included in the ﬁnancial state-
ments on a consolidated basis beginning in the fourth quarter of 
2018 will contribute to ramping up earnings in earnest beginning in 
2019, turning the security business into a new growth driver for SK 
Telecom following the media businesses. The security business is 
a high-involvement service with a high ﬁxed cost ratio and a high 
conversion cost for consumers. Preempting the security market and 
securing economies of scale in it can have far-reaching effects, and 
technological innovation is vital to the success of the security busi-
ness. In 2018, SK Telecom secured a market share of over 30%

dition, the size of the security market is expected to grow steadily 
at 7% to 8% annually due to a continuous increase in demand for 
physical security, stronger compliance with personal information 
protection, the digitalization of industry, and growing demand due 
to the importance of information security. In addition to enhancing 
the competitiveness of the current business in the expanding secu-
rity market, we will create synergies by integrating the distribution 
network and infrastructure of ADT Caps and strengthening product 
packages  with  SK  T elecom.  SK  T elecom  will  grow  into  a  leading  
company in the security market by offering differentiated products 
such as customized home security services and security services 
for cars at parking lots connected with T map. The company will 
develop a new security service area to ensure the overall safety of 
society, beyond the convergence security of information security 
and physical security, and present it to the market.

11st, established as an independent corporation in 2018, will pursue 
proﬁtability-based growth and becoming a customer-oriented com-
merce portal in 2019 with the goal of reaching a break-even point. 
It will pursue becoming a differentiated commerce portal based on 
several innovations - approaching customers not as a simple place 
to buy goods, but as a platform that enables to acquire and search 
for information on tangible and intangible goods, strengthening 
direct visits to the online shopping mall by improving content and 
usage experiences rather than being involved in time-consuming 
price competitions, and offering new AI/Mobility-based shopping 
experiences. We will also nurture proﬁtable new categories and 
reinforce product inﬂows through external partnerships. Moreover, 
SK Telecom will concentrate on creating synergies among members 
of the SK ICT Family through the integration of simple payment and 
mileage systems and achieve differentiation by securing 11st’s ex-
clusive product categories including the online distribution of mo-
bile phones and the sale of digital content. In 2019, we will pursue 
efﬁcient marketing spending and healthy growth driven by a direct 
inﬂux of customers in the same context as in 2018 and expect to 
boost 11st’s proﬁtability through double-digit revenue growth in the 
open market with low ﬁxed costs.29(5:+(/0,1*9,&725<7+528*+&216758&7,21

SK Telecom enhanced its implementation power and made 5G 
services the center of all business activities by internally setting up 
dedicated 5G departments within its main business divisions while 
securing the ability to take the lead in the upcoming 5G market by 
continuing its technological cooperation and strategic alliance with global players. In 2019, the company will provide 5G services in the 
Seoul metropolitan area and major cities across the nation and will focus on preempting new business models based on 5G services 
rather than costly competition.
SK Telecom is concentrating on building a business portfolio that 
will maximize proﬁts in the 5G era. Media and commerce are already 
moving from TVs and PCs to smartphones. We expect them to enable 
full-ﬂedged high-deﬁnition content-based OTT services and start 
the era of mobile commerce based on next-generation technology 
by mixing with 5G technology. We are zeroing in on strengthening 
competitiveness and enhancing value in areas such as high-
deﬁnition media content, AR/VR, and cloud games. In the security 
sector, technologies such as real-time incident detection and image 
analysis will create great value and be able to develop new B2B 
models by meeting the characteristics of 5G services including 
hyper-low latency. In addition, with our New ICT capabilities and 5G 
technology, we are in the process of establishing a business model 
that combines the capability of AI and data with mobility platforms 
that has differentiated competitive edge such as T map and T map 
Taxi, while pursuing a business model innovation in the IoT ﬁeld 
with services such as smart broadcasting and smart ofﬁces. 
5G-related investment will be made based on customer demand 
and additional revenue generation levels so that there will be no 
shortage of investment in commercialization and market leadership. 
At the same, we will make investment in 5G services at an optimal 
level by considering efﬁcient measures such as a ﬂexible adjustment 
of investment in current network facilities such as LTE networks.
For SK Telecom, 2019 is the ﬁrst year of 5G services. SK Telecom will 
become the overwhelming No. 1 mobile carrier by creating a hyper-
wide gap in the network area that is the basis of mobile carriers 
such as AI-based network operation technology and the exclusive 
adoption of quantum cryptography security technology.38 39 6.7(/(&20$118$/5(3257

In 2018, the consolidated revenues stood at KRW 40,445.1 billion, an Since its establishment in 1997, SK Broadband has been leading the 
paradigm of the Korean ICT industry while expanding its business scope from being the world’s ﬁrst ADSL services provider as well as 
the ﬁrst wireless broadband internet services provider in Korea to 
become a multimedia services provider including IPTV and mobile 
OTT services (Over The Top, video media platform).In 2018, SK Broadband achieved the highest revenue and proﬁt 
growth by sustaining the growth of subscribers, focusing on 
premium services such as Giga/UHD and enhancing its value as 
a media platform. Revenue grew evenly across all business areas 
excluding home phone service, resulting in KRW 3,253.7 billion in 
revenue even with the revenue decline effects due to the application 
of IFRS15 standards. Of these, IPTV revenue totalled KRW 1,278.4 
billion, taking the lead in driving up overall revenue. Higher revenue 
and proﬁtability pulled up operating proﬁt 38.5% YoY to KRW 175.6 
billion. The company secured 3.93 million wired phone subscribers 
- 2.25 million regular phone subscribers, 1.68 million internet phone 
subscribers - and 4.73 million IPTV subscribers in addition to 5.41 
million broadband internet service subscribers.

Operating Proﬁt Revenue Revenue Operating Proﬁt DRAMincrease of 34% from the previous year due to a rise in the average 
ASP of DRAMs because of the robust IT demand and an uptake in the revenue volume of memory products. In terms of operating 
proﬁt, combined revenue of DRAMs and NAND ﬂashes reached KRW 
20,843.8 billion or 52% of total revenue through an increase in 
sales of DRAMs for high-value-added servers and a spike in sales of 3D NAND ﬂashes and NAND ﬂashes for high-value-added solution.
After the unprecedented boom in semiconductor history over 
the past two years, the chipmaker is facing a tough business 
environment such as growing global economic uncertainties and a 
slowdown in demand for memories. However, SK Hynix will tackle 
them by stepping up its efforts such as securing technology and 
cost competitiveness, improving customer responsiveness, and 
reforming its corporate culture. Moreover, SK Hynix aims to take 
the lead in transforming our society and humanity while pursuing 
double bottom line (DBL) management that simultaneously 
generates ﬁnancial and social value.SK Broadband will leap forward as the No. 1 media platform company 
in the world by pursuing next-generation media business, AI-based 
Btv services, and the growth of home IoT services with putting 
customer happiness on our top priority.
Competition will intensify such as alliances and mergers among 
operators and services in order to break the limitations of IPTV 
platforms and a net increase in subscribers will shrink due to a

security and manpower security company, has been growing to provide the best quality and service to our customers based on 
advanced technology and service know-how. ADT Caps, which 
provides integrated security services such as unmanned security, 
video security, and dispatch security based on integrated control, holds ADT Security, a company specializing in the theft prevention 
system, and CAPSTEC, a specialist in security personnel services as 
its subsidiaries. ADT Caps with a total of 8,000 security professionals 
is a leader in the physical security market and provides optimized 
services for each customer. In 2018, SK Telecom took over Life & 
Security Holdings, the parent company of ADT Caps. Hence, ADT 
Caps became a member of the SK Telecom family and merged with 
NSOK, the fourth-largest player in the physical security market and 
a grandson company of SK Telecom. As an axis of SK Telecom’s 
growth in the convergence security business, ADT Caps is ready to 
begin anew.Since entering the e-commerce market in February 2008, 11st is 
growing rapidly to become an industry-leading open market 
platform. The company has a system that enables customers to 
purchase excellent products at low prices without any worries both 
online and mobile devices and strives to provide the best services 
to both sellers and buyers through a continuous improvement in 
services and technological innovation. Since its establishment, 
11st has grown dramatically only to become Korea’s leading open 
market platform with 27 million members. In 2018, with the launch

by customers and began a new challenge for the future of online 
commerce in Korea.In 2018, combined revenue of ADT Caps, CAPSTEC and ADT Security 
stood at KRW 776.3 billion, up 7.6% from the previous year. 
Operating proﬁt fell 29.4% to KRW 101.3 billion due to one-time 
expenses related to SK Telecom’s absorption of an afﬁliate and the 
acquisition of NSOK.
In the future, ADT Caps will generate synergies in analytical 
capabilities with SK Telecom’s ICT technology, AI-based security 
technology and expand the identity of the security business as a 
safety and care-specialized company beyond security and position 
itself as a leading company in convergence security market.In 2018, 11st posted KRW 674.4 billion in revenue, down KRW 10.4 
billion from the previous year. However, its operating loss dropped to 
KRW 67.8 billion from KRW 86.2 billion in the previous year, thanks to 
proﬁtability improvement activities conducted throughout the year.
11st will continue innovation to grow into an online commerce portal 
that provides all products and information of the world, going 
beyond remaining the most advanced open market through its top-
level customer base and product curation and synergies among SK

5G is the 5th generation mobile communication 
standard that follows CDMA (2nd generation), WCDMA 
(3rd generation), and LTE (4th generation). It also has 
the characteristics of hyper- speed, hyper-massive 
connections and hyper-low latency. It is a foundational 
infrastructure that connects all people and objects 
and makes it possible to collect and analyze data with 
artificial intelligence by converting offline areas into 
wireless, going beyond the norms of smartphones and 
bringing about structural changes in current business. 
As 5G was commercialized in Korea for the first time 
in the world on April 3, 2019, the world’s attention 
has been focused on the excellence and potential of 
new network infrastructure. As a result, it is needed 
to thoroughly prepare to lead an ICT ecosystem to 
which 5G will expand. 
ICT, the center of the 4th industrial revolution, brings innovation to our lives as intelligent information 
technology that has a great impact on society and 
industry as a whole. 5G’s hyper-connection and 
hyper-intelligence are expected to considerably 
boost the potential and efficiency of the entire areas 
across industries, lifestyles and business. Thus, 5G 
is expected to create a KRW 1,161 trillion market 
by 2026. In order to lead the era of innovation 
that transcends borders and realms, we ought to 
secure differentiated global competitiveness beyond 
paradigms of current industries.
There is a growing awareness that corporates should 
take responsibility for the various impacts of their 
management activities on society and promote 
long-term happiness among the corporates and their 
stakeholders. Recent global trends in corporates’ 
pursuit of social value and responsible management 
emphasize social value creation through core 
business innovation, moving beyond simple social 
contribution activities. This requires a sophisticated 
system or valuation methodology to assess and 
manage the impact of corporate activities that are 
not reflected in the corporate financial statements or 
market prices.SK Telecom aims to lead the 4th Industrial Revolution 
by setting up portfolios of 4 business divisions - 
MNO, media, security, and commerce - based on 
5G and AI. To this end, SK Telecom will innovate 
its business models through the sharing of core 
technology and infrastructure among the 4 business 
divisions. In addition, SK Telecom will strengthen

SK Telecom promotes sustainable growth by propelling 
new business strategy of ‘creating social value’ based on SK group’s management philosophy-SKMS(SK Management System). The company also strives to innovate and develop business models that are being required by our stakeholders through the Double Bottom Line (DBL), a methodology for evaluating and measuring both economic and social value creation. SK Telecom measured the integrated performance as a Double Bottom Line by conducting an environmental profit and loss analysis, to assess the environmental impact across the entire value chain, and through the social profit and loss analysis which calculates the social performance generated through products and services. We will continue to communicate social value with various stakeholders and upgrade our Double Bottom Line methodology. At the same time, we will lay out the foundation for sustainable growth by creating true social value   in the process of reviewing, 
supplementing, and improving our achievements.0$1$*(0(1729(59,(: | 3(5)250$1&($1'287/22.

mobile edge computing (MEC), dual connectivity, 
and quantum cryptography after contributing to the 
standardization of 5G technology in 2018. Based 
on this technology, SK Telecom will lead the 5G 
market and, at the same time, introduce 5G as a 
momentum for discovering new business models 
through services not available in the areas of media, 
security, commerce, and AI/Mobility. In particular, 
in consideration of customer needs, SK Telecom 
prepared services and content in the core areas of 
hyper-high definition media, AR/VR and games based 
on 5G technology, and secured its own technological 
competitiveness and content via exclusive business 
ties with global top-tier companies. •  In June 2018, SK Telecom laid the foundation for building competitive network 
infrastructure by securing frequency bands at the 5G spectrum auction held by the 
Ministry of Science and ICT.
•  In October 2018, SK Telecom succeeded in making the first 5G call in the 3.5GHz 
band with equipment from Samsung Electronics.
•  In December 2018, the company launched the world’s first 5G smart factory 
solution in the B2B sector.

the network accessibility gap by ensuring that the 
benefits of a quality and secure network are equally 
available, regardless of geographical location.As SK Telecom secured an additional frequency band in 2016 and introduced new technologies, the company has provided 
unrivaled communication services in terms of LTE coverage 
and speed compared to its competitors nationwide. The 
company is focusing on providing maximum coverage and 
speed services in the 5G era, and will provide customers 
with differentiated 5G service experiences through network 
construction/operation considering the key characteristics of 
5G service (speed and latency) and attributes in indoor and

Through the company’s continued success and development, SK Telecom seeks to create value for its stakeholders 
as well as contribute to social and economic development and the well-being of humankind. In October 2016, SK 
Group revised its management system, SKMS, and expressed its resolution to make ‘stakeholders’ happiness’ its top 
philosophy and increase the company’s social value. SK Telecom amended its corporate Articles of Incorporation to 
include this resolution in March 2017, and reﬂected it in the Corporate Governance Charter adopted in February 2018.
To put this into practice, SK Telecom clearly delineates its stakeholders into six groups, namely, customers, business 
partners, employees, local communities/NGOs, shareholders, and the government and is carrying out management 
activities based on communication with these groups.
SK Telecom established its stakeholder engagement policies and both internally and externally expressed its commitment 
to stakeholder engagement. Based upon this, the company further improves the transparency and efﬁciency of its 
management through stakeholder engagement and seeks to acquire stakeholders’ support and trust. SK Telecom’s 
stakeholder engagement policies deﬁne the requirements for internal and external stakeholders to participate in 
all management activities, and to provide guidelines from the company-wide perspective related to stakeholder 
communication to the relevant internal organizations, and to provide a process to resolve stakeholder issues. 
SK Telecom transparently discloses its management direction and achievements through various public disclosures, 
general shareholders meetings, BOD meetings, business reports, and its homepage. The company constantly collects 
stakeholders’ opinions through various communication channels and promptly responds to them. In accordance with 
the company’s stakeholder engagement policy, SK Telecom operates a responsibility system in which designated 
departments and staff in charge are assigned by individual departments to manage and process the communication 
channels. In 2018, the company was able to identify stakeholders’ main issues through stakeholder communication 
channels - the issues were then discussed with internal and external experts and were incorporated into the materiality 
assessment process which is approved by the Corporate Citizenship Committee under the BOD. Through such efforts, 
SK Telecom was able to expand the overall scope of stakeholder feedback incorporation. SK Telecom will continue 
to maintain a transparent process to factor material issues through its constant communication channels in order to 
maximize the management’s strategic decision-making and creation of long-term value.
SK Telecom operates a comprehensive online channel that collects stakeholders’ CSR grievances regarding labor, 
human rights, environment, and ethics. Through this channel, the company is able to comprehend stakeholders’ 
feedbacks on its management activities, as well as actively resolve managerial grievances and complaints on cases 
such as company’s actions that are not socially responsible or any cases of inﬂicted damage. 
The received feedbacks and grievances through the CSR Grievance Channel are resolved by the departments through 
a process of fact-checking, monitoring and due diligence. For cases that seem to be a material CSR issue, SK Telecom 
reports the content and the handling process itself to the Corporate Citizenship Committee under the BOD. SK Telecom 
is constantly putting in efforts of improvement to prevent similar cases from happening through incorporating such 
process into business activities.ACCOUNTABILITY FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OUR BUSINESS OF VALUE CREATION MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW0$1$*(0(1729(59,(: | 3(5)250$1&($1'287/22.

The strengthening of ICT infrastructure comprises the enhancement 
of 5G networks, AI technology and the innovation of infrastructure. 
The success of the 4th Industrial Revolution should be based on 
network infrastructure that enables massive connection of devices, 
elevates transmission speed, and realizes hyper-low latency 
services. 5G will act as a stepping stone, not only as a prerequisite, 
for the processing of a rapidly growing data transmission volume 
but also as key infrastructure for future technologies such as AI, 
autonomous vehicles, VR, and the IoT.
At 11pm on April 3, 2019, SK Telecom began the world’s ﬁrst 
commercialization of 5G services. 5G is the core element that 
will lead all kinds of business and SK Telecom is concentrating 
all of its capabilities on securing differentiated competitive edges 
through commercialization with stability and safety. In 2018, we 
continued to strengthen our capabilities as a network operator 
by securing frequencies and standardizing on technology for 
the 5G era. We cooperated with various partners to seize new 
business opportunities. Internally, we set up dedicated 5G units, 
in four major divisions (MNO, media, security, commerce) across 
the company to strongly drive the 5G business. Each division 
is centered on maximizing synergies to plan and develop new 
business models for the 5G era. Externally, SK Telecom contributed 
to establish 5G technology standards globally to accelerate the 
launch of commercial 5G services by opening and sharing cutting-
edge technology.
As a member of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) with 
about 50 global ICT companies and standardization organizations, 
SK Telecom shared 5G core technologies such as radio transmission 
and reception technology including Beamforming and high-
capacity multi-input/output devices, network virtualization, large-
volume and hyper-low latency data transmission technology. The 
company joined the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Alliance, 
a 5G telecommunications alliance, as a key member to promote 
cooperation by opening and sharing 5G technologies. Moreover, 
as a founding member of the Networking project under the Linux 
Foundation, we took the initiative in exchanges of 5G technologies 
and services by building and continuously improving an integrated 
open source framework required for the advancement of 5G network 
technology with global telecommunications companies such as 
Verizon, AT&T, China Mobile, Vodafone and Orange.6($0/(666(59,&(9,$+,*+/<$'9$1&('

In June 2018, SK Telecom laid the groundwork for the world’s ﬁrst 
commercialization of 5G networks by securing a 100MHz from the 
3.5GHz band (Block C) and 800MHz from the 28GHz band in the 5G 
spectrum auction held in Korea. The two bands are the most secure 
bands for 5G services as they are most scalable and subject to the fewest interruptions. We can achieve about 20% faster speed than 
other companies through the secured frequencies. Moreover, SK 
Telecom plans to set up a network that can cover the widest area 
in Korea. SK Telecom has approximately 34,000 base stations as 
of April 2, 2019, securing stronger competitiveness compared to 
its competitors. In addition to Seoul, the company is expanding its competitiveness in 5G network by building coverage around areas 
where 5G utility is maximized; six major metropolitan cities and 85 
key areas nationwide, universities, KTX, metropolitan subway, and 
beaches. SK Telecom is expanding not only its regional coverage 
but also its coverage inside buildings. We plan to actualize a 
transmission speed that is approximately 4 times faster than 
other companies’ through SK Telecom’s autonomously developed 
technology called ‘In-Building Total Solution.’ 
We are focusing on securing differentiated network competitiveness 
by expanding 5G coverage and optimizing 5G performances 
and quality and at the same time, striving to strengthen our 
technological capabilities in 5G network solutions. When storing 
hyper-high-volume content on smart devices, ‘5GX Turbo Mode’ is 
instantly activated and increases speed to maximum of 2.7Gbps. 
5GX Turbo mode is a state-of-the-art technology that utilizes dual 
connectivity, which is an international standard technology. When 
downloading with general 5G, hyper-high capacity VR contents that 
take more than one minute can be downloaded in just 36 seconds 
with 5GX Turbo mode. When connecting an autonomous vehicle or 
a smart home, the 5GX hyper-low latency mode, which increases 5G 
response speed to the maximum level, enables instant responses

Since SK Telecom established the Quantum Technology Research In-
stitute in 2011, the company has developed quantum cryptographic 
telecommunications technology. In 2016, the company applied quan-
tum cryptography to a LTE backhaul between Sejong and Daejeon in 
Korea for the ﬁrst time in the world. In 2017, we developed the world’s 
smallest quantum random number generation (QRNG) chip. In Febru -
ary 2018, we acquired the Swiss ID Quantique (IDQ), the world’s  No. 1 
quantum cryptographic telecommunications company, to beef up our 
technological competitiveness. Four of SK Telecom’s new technolo -
gies related to quantum cryptography are currently adopted as inter-
national standardization tasks of the International Telecommunication 
Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T), which sets 
standards in the telecommunications sector as an afﬁliated organiza -
tion of the ITU, the world’s  leading international telecommunication 
organization. SK Telecom is the only company that performs more 
than four international standardization tasks, which proves that it is 
the world’s best company in the ﬁeld of quantum cryptography. SK 
Telecom will gradually expand the application of quantum cryptogra -
phy technology to telecommunication networks, providing customers 
with absolute reliability, of which they trust, with tight security in 5G networks where security is expected to become more important.

Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) can expand the possibilities of the age of 
hyper-Innovation based on 5G technology. SK Telecom is accelerating 
the innovation of its existing businesses and the creation of new 
businesses based on AI. SK Telecom’s ‘Super Nova’ technology 
contributes to improving service quality and shortening working 
time by improving the quality of video and audio. By subdividing the 
number of pixels in low-resolution images, the technology can ﬁnd optimal colors for separated pixels with an AI-based deep learning 
algorithm, thereby improving not only video but also audio quality. 
The Super Nova technology, originally developed to secure high-
quality images required for semiconductor quality assurance (QA), was 
successfully used by SK Hynix in October 2018 and succeeded in greatly 
boosting the efﬁciency and productivity of manufacturing processes. 
The technology is expected to widespread as a solution that can be 
applied in various industrial sectors such as smart factories, content 
platforms, intelligent security services and e-commerce. SK Telecom 
will continue to focus on securing promising technologies and creating 
synergy so that AI and data technologies can become the foundation 
for corporate competitiveness and innovation in business models.675(1*7+(1,1*,&7,1)5$6758&785(285%86,1(662)9$/8(&5($7,21 | 1(:,&7675$7(*<

Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a technology that processes information at the edge nearest the mobile user, as its 
name suggests. Whereas the original data processing method was centralized, mobile edge computing reduces network latency time and provides seamless hyper-low latency mobile telecommunications services by storing, processing and transmitting data in the communication network that is closest to a user.In general, there were at least four steps to transfer data from a 5G smartphone to an internet data center, but MEC technology will shorten it to two steps, reducing data latency by up to 60% when used in the 5G network. MEC’s dramatic reduction in data transmission time is particularly important in AR/VR services, cloud games, autonomous driving/vehicle control and real-time live broadcasts, all of which require hyper-low latency. It is expected to bring about big changes in the 5G era such as the prevention of customer safety accidents and hacking. In the case of an autonomous car, if a car accident occurs in the Busan section of the Seoul-Busan Expressway, CCTV data is transmitted to an integrated control center in Seoul via optical cables. But if the MEC has a server connected to a telecommunications network that is adjacent to the road, the data can be directly transmitted to neighboring vehicles without being sent to the central server, thereby shortening telecommunications delay time for autonomous driving. In addition, MEC can be a solution to reduce security problems by eliminating the need to go through a wired internet section that is difﬁcult to manage and control while uploading sensitive data such as photos and videos. SK Telecom’s unique quantum cryptography technology can be applied to MEC services, so the company is planning to develop innovative MEC services based on its assets and data.SK Telecom’s current MEC technology reduces the transmission interval by installing small data centers at 5G base stations or switches - SK Telecom has been striving to develop platforms and expand the ecosystem based on MEC technology. In 2018, SK Telecom signed a business agreement for technology cooperation with Deutsche Telekom’s subsidiary 
MobiledgeX in Germany. In 2019, we introduced an industrial AR service powered by MEC together with MobiledgeX at the 2019 Mobile World Congress (MWC) and are cooperating on an MEC developer ecosystem with the International Telecom Infra Project (TIP) led by Facebook. In March 2019, SK Telecom completed the establishment of an open MEC platform, unveiled and shared the platform for business partners to easily provide relevant services. Developers will be able to enhance the quality of customer service experiences by linking services that require the characteristics of hyper-low latency with the SK Telecom’s MEC platform. In addition, we are supporting partners so that they can receive the various data and functions necessary for service development by providing an open application programming interface (API). SK Telecom will do its utmost to realize 5G services and technology with overwhelming speed and safety by taking the lead in technology development and expanding 5G ecosystems.6+257&87,1'$7$75$160,66,210(&&25(+<3(5/2:/$7(1&<* 7(&+12/2*< &$6(
The upcoming Age of Hyper-Innovation means the birth of a hyper-connection world where all objects and people are 
connected via networks. In areas where thorough security is required such as autonomous driving, ﬁnance, telemedicine, and smart factories, vast amounts of data will be transmitted through 5G networks. This is why SK Telecom concentrates on implementing the highest level of secure telecommunications infrastructure through quantum cryptographic telecommunications technology in line with the evolution of 5G services.Although current cryptographic algorithms in telecommunication system seem random, the algorithms actually consists of ﬁgures with certain patterns. As quantum computers are emerging with data processing speeds 100 million times faster than current-generation supercomputers, the importance of security is on the rise as the predictability of existing cryptographic schemes increases. Quantum cryptographic telecommunications technology uses the characteristics of quantum physics to prevent eavesdropping by creating cryptographic keys that only senders and receivers can decrypt. It is assessed as the most secure telecommunications encryption method among security technologies available at the present.SK Telecom has applied the Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) of IDQ, a Swiss quantum cryptographic telecommunications company that SK Telecom acquired last year, to 5G subscriber authentication servers since March 2019. The subscriber authentication process is the ﬁrst and essential step for a device user. If the authentication key value is leaked, customer information can be used for crimes such as eavesdropping and hacking, so security at this stage is more important than anything else.The QRNG used by SK Telecom at the subscriber authentication stage is a device that generates random numbers that cannot be used in analyzing patterns themselves using quantum characteristics and blocks the risk of being hacked through the telecommunications network. Moreover, starting from April 2019, SK Telecom will make 5G and LTE data transmission and reception more secure by beeﬁng up IDQ’s quantum key distribution (QKD) technology in the Seoul-Daejeon section, which is the core transmission area of data trafﬁc, and expand its application step by step.(1+$1&,1**1(7:25.6(&85,7<:,7+723&/$667(&+12/2*<OUR BUSINESS OF VALUE CREATION ACCOUNTABILITY FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW

In 2018, SK Telecom acquired ADT Caps, the No.2 domestic physical 
security, and merged it with NSOK, followed by the acquistion of SK In-fosec, the No.1 domestic information security company to establish the ICT convergence security portfolio. SK Telecom is striving to optimize the physical security business through utilization of AI. SK Telecom’s ICT convergence security service is to speed up physical 
security responses and optimize all the security systems based on 5G networks and technology. For example, AI can predict an area where ac-cidents are likely to occur. Optimizing movements by security personnel and vehicles, AI shortens the time from departure to arrival and responds after making accurate judgments about speciﬁc behaviors and anomalies with high-quality intelligent analysis of images using 5G-based big data. It enhances the accuracy of alarms by combining IoT sensors and image analysis and creates an environment where security drones perform most external monitoring tasks.One of the main services of SK Telecom’s security solutions, Intelligent CCTV T view, can grasp abnormal symptoms on its own based on deep learning, a core AI technology. With functions such as real-time tres-pass surveillance, conﬁrmation on number of people within designated area, automatic improvement on video quality in case of bad weather or nighttime, detection of damage in camera, and storing images to cloud server after encryption, T view prevents dangerous situations by alerting security managers or send them on site, or make pre-arrangements of personnel or vehicles on site where high possibility of dangerous situa-tion is expected. SK Telecom will maximize the synergies of the merger by achieving quantitative and qualitative growth of the Security Division by changing the landscape of competition in the physical security market by utilizing video security technology and big data.

In February 2019, SK Telecom launched ‘5G Smart Ofﬁce’ to create syn-
ergies between its business divisions and to boost the efﬁciency and productivity of its partners following 5G Smart Factory. 5G Smart Ofﬁce is a combination of high technologies such as 5G, AI, the IoT, security and AR/VR. It is a space where people can work while exchanging data without the limitations of time and space as people, devices, and sen-sors are closely connected to one another no matter when and where they are. 5G technology can not only facilitate high-capacity data trans-mission, but can also enable real-time collaboration and contribute to creating an efﬁcient work environment in order to process simple tasks such as the reservation of a conference room, the operation of air con-ditioning and heating systems. For example, 5G Smart Ofﬁce proposes a customized work space based on emotional analysis of employees, and 5G Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) docking system allows em-ployees to instantly connect to the virtual desktop environment with their smartphone (without PCs or laptops), shortening the time spent in setting up and starting work. AR glasses enable those in distant locations to view large-volume image data together or have a meeting with a 3D design drawing as if they were in the same room through simultaneous access.SK Telecom plans to study ways to develop its business model through partnership with cloud providers, hardware and software partners, and security solution companies while running ‘a 5G Smart Ofﬁce’ as a test bed. We expect ‘5G Smart Ofﬁce’ to act as a catalyst for knowledge-intensive industry innovation and create social value by maximizing work efﬁciency and productivity.OUR BUSINESS OF VALUE CREATION ACCOUNTABILITY FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW0$;,0,=,1*9$/8(2)7+(1(:,&73257)2/,2

The competition in the mobile media content market has never been more 
intense - the market is becoming a test bed for strategic differentiation into which global companies, such as Apple, Netﬂix, Amazon and others are throwing their hats in order to attract consumers based on innovative technologies. SK Broadband’s oksusu, the No. 1 OTT provider in Korea with 973 million subscribers as of the end of 2018, is also continuing to innovate both internally and externally to sharpen its competitiveness.Internally, the SK Telecom Media Labs, the AI technology unit and SK Broadband are promoting AI-based media platform innovation by team-ing up with one another. In September of 2018, SK Telecom launched a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, an artiﬁcial neural networks with matrix factorization method, a content recommendation algorithm based on AI technology. Developed under the idea that the human brain is based on continuous information rather than a fragmentary way when it accepts information, the RNN model can analyze the video streaming pattern of our customers’ by referring to the association with previously watched contents. In addition to simply viewing customers’ viewing his-tories, it also collects the number of streaming and playback times of the same content and feeds interest and concentration levels into the content recommendation system. As a result, customers can save time and receive more precise content recommendations. In addition, we de-veloped ‘Scene Discovery,’ an AI-based scene retrieval technology, in line with media consumption trends in a mo bile environment. Scene search tech-
nology enables AI to collect scenes of viewers’ favorite actors in speciﬁc media content such as movies and dramas, or to select scenes from various situations such as kissing, dancing, and eating. We will gradually enhance scene detection technology that has been applied to B TV since August 2018 by developing emotion recognition technology based on human facial expressions and speech recognition technology. In addition, SK Telecom is creating synergies with the reinforcement of media content by launch-ing Flo, a music platform that utilizes the SK Telecom Media Labs’ deep learning technology and the AI Center’s sound analysis technology. Un-like traditional domestic music platforms that provide services based on real-time popular charts, Flo is a personalized music platform that allows users to discover their own musical tastes through deep learn-ing. As Flo accumulates user data, the likelihood to ﬁnd the right kind of music for the user increases. The platform also provides playlists recommended by experts that are categorized into genres, situations, and mood. In addition, with the Adaptive UX, users are able to choose one of several playlists based on music preferences, favorite artists and genres, and real-time music charts. Users can create up to three characters per user ID to distinguish music preferences, which presents an environment that allows users to listen to music of preference for each different lifestyle situations such as commuting, workout/exercise, and playing music for kids.VW(YROYLQJLQWR6PDUW&RPPHUFH3RUWDO

SK Telecom is constantly contemplating to ﬁnd ways to prevent disas-
ters and prepare for emergencies by using the New ICT technology. In November 2018, SK Telecom launched an integrated ﬁre management solution that can remotely monitor wireless ﬁre detectors and quickly ﬁnd out their locations through a dedicated IoT network. Most of the current ﬁre-management equipment were simple ﬁre detectors connect-ed to receivers through lines in buildings. It is difﬁcult for wired receiv-ers to detect the locations of ﬁres quickly, and ﬁre detectors frequently fails due to negligent management. A standalone wireless ﬁre detector that covers up the shortcomings of wired receivers also has its limita-tions as it cannot cope with a ﬁre in a remote place.SK Telecom’s integrated ﬁre management solution enables the real-time 
monitoring of information sent by a wireless ﬁre detector through the LoRa network. This allows automatic monitoring of temperature information and abnormalities of equipment in a building and can effectively respond to ﬁres by accumulating and analyzing data. In particular, this solution is based on the mobile web, thereby places vulnerable to ﬁre can be moni-tored  with mobile devices anytime and anywhere. Fire detectors connected to the LoRa network automatically update room temperature information every hour to a cloud computing system and sends battery information once a day, allowing users to analyze data. In this context, SK Telecom is advancing services by combining the services of SK Broadband and ADT Caps such as applying SK Telecom’s wireless ﬁre management solution to ‘CLOUD CAM,’ an intelligent video security service of SK Broadband, and the ‘ADT Fire Monitoring Service’ of ADT Caps.285%86,1(662)9$/8(&5($7,21 | 1(:,&7675$7(*<62 63 6.7(/(&20$118$/5(3257
Infrastructure that SK Telecom has accumulated over the years such 
as networks artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), data, distribution network,  
is expected to create new market opportunities, such as autono-
mous vehicles and smart cities in the mid- to long term. SK Telecom 
will improve management performances and corporate value, and 
create more social value by developing its ICT and management 
support infrastructure into infrastructure shared with afﬁliates and 
business partners. 
First of all, SK Telecom is pursuing shared infrastructure among the 
MNO, media, security, and commerce divisions. For example, by col-
lecting and analyzing customer data through areas with high contacts 
with customers such as MNO, IPTV and e-commerce, the company 
can acquire insights and knowledge of customers and use them in or-
der to create new business models. Furthermore, based on network 
stability and safety, part of SK Telecom’s major competitiveness in 
the 5G era, we will be able to build a virtuous cycle of value creation 
based on data and network infrastructure such as expanding the 
base for IoT services including autonomous vehicles and healthcare. 
In addition, we plan to concentrate group-level capabilities includ-
ing afﬁliates and invested companies through shared structure 
among all the members of the SK ICT Family. SK ICT Family re-
fers to ICT afﬁliates of the SK Group including SK Telecom and 
its subsidiaries. We will seek to enhance the utilization of core 
infrastructure capabilities between companies and build a win-win 
business model through cooperation. For example, we can build a 
new collaborative framework by connect with business partners 
and integrating purchasing infrastructure and will seek constructive 
and mutual growth. 
Furthermore, we will create value in a broader area by pursuing 
shared infrastructure with other companies and society as well. 
We will veer away from the exhaustive competition that had lasted 
in order to expand market shares for many years among mobile 
carriers and switch to a win-win frame for the purpose of fuel-
ing growth. In addition, we will look for and develop new proﬁt 
structures through the convergence on competencies of different 
industries. We will also try to ﬁnd ways to maximize positive effects 
that contribute to solving social problems and minimize negative 
effects of business activities by measuring and assessing socio-
environmental impacts through business.
The shared infrastructure deﬁned by SK Telecom means going be-
yond simple sharing, having insight into correlations among seg-
mented thoughts and scientiﬁcally reconstructing them to create 
new value. SK Telecom will create integrated value beyond the cur-
rent value creating paradigm and build an ICT ecosystem for sharing 
and cooperation as the New ICT leader that will lead changes in 
industry and lifestyles.&5($7,1*1(:9$/8(7+528*+6+$5(',1)5$6758&785(

SK Telecom is seeking ways to enhance the social and economic 
efﬁciency of its assets by sharing its tangible and intangible assets 
with its stakeholders. Recently, the company provided its service 
vehicles for the Korean Red Cross to be used as blood collection 
vehicles. At the same time, SK Telecom dispatched the vehicles to take claims by offering consultation, inspection, diagnosis, while 
also providing mobile device repair services for our customers re-
siding in remote areas or military bases where our customers had 
often experienced inconvenience from getting customer service. We 
are planning to expand the scope of this program as it has the ad-
vantages of encouraging people’s participation in blood donation and creating social value while enhancing service accessibility for 
customers. 
Moreover, in order to solve recently emerging social problems of ﬁne 
dust, we launched a ﬁne dust map application ‘Everyair’ through 
collection of ﬁne dust data by installing air quality measurement 
sensors in SK Telecom retail shops and 1,200 indoor and outdoor 
base stations all over the nation, collaborated with electronic carts 
of Korea Yakult Co. Ltd., and ﬁne dust measurement system of Wi-
nix. Moreover, we opened branch ofﬁces and retail shops in major 
cities throughout the country starting in 2019 with the belief that 
ICT is the future competitiveness of Korea, and is also pushing a  
coding education project, utilizing a smart robot ‘Albert’ for chil-
dren aged from 6 to 10. We are also operating ‘Exciting Coding 
Class,’ a pilot program, which is geared toward promoting creative 
and convergence ICT education for children to provide education 
infrastructure for children who want to study after hours, utilizing 
time after 18:00 or Saturday at branch ofﬁces for the program.

Recently, our society is suffering from voice phishing. In the ﬁrst 
half of 2018, the amount of damage caused by voice phishing was 
estimated at KRW 180.2 billion, a 73.7% increase from the ﬁrst 
half of 2017. Therefore, it is urgently needed to tackle the phishing 
issue. Not only has the damage increased, but also voice phish-
ing methods have become more sophisticated. This situation has 
prompted SK Telecom to develop and introduce artiﬁcial intelligence 
technology with the Financial Supervisory Service to prevent voice 
phishing cases. Unlike the old ﬁltering system that checks whether 
a voice is from a voice phisher based on the use of a speciﬁc word, 
the new ﬁltering system based on AI can judge whether or not a 
voice phisher is making a call based on the context of sentences, 
thereby preventing voice phishing more accurately and efﬁciently. 
Hence, the new system will signiﬁcantly reduce phishing damage 
and fraudulent activities. Moreover, while SK Telecom develops 
technology that informs users in real time when voice phishing is 
suspected during voice calls, the Financial Supervisory Service will 
support the development through providing data related to voice 
phishing scams. SK Telecom is making efforts to prevent crime and 
protect victims by utilizing its LBS (Location Based Service) tech-
nology based on mobile communication and IoT and big data tech-
nology. SK Telecom and the Ministry of Justice have continuously 
collaborated to beef up the social safety net based on electronic 
monitoring devices since the introduction of the electronic monitor-
ing system for domestic criminal probation in 2008. In November 
2018, the two organizations signed an agreement to promote crime 
prevention based on advanced ICT technology. Under the agree-
ment, we decided to move ahead in developing electronic protec-
tive devices & systems for the socially disadvantaged such as vic-
tims of crimes and assemble a joint big data research Task Force 
to develop a preemptive crime prediction system. SK Telecom will 
contribute to create a safe, crime-free social environment by shar-
ing our advanced ICT technology with government and the society. OUR BUSINESS OF VALUE CREATION ACCOUNTABILITY FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW

A 2018 report on the digital divide by the Ministry of Science and ICT and the National Information Society Agency 
states that the level of disadvantaged people in terms of information accessibility (persons with disabilities, low-income households, agricultural population, aquaculture population, senior citizens) stood at 68.9%, compared to those who were not. Among them, the senior citizen group recorded 63.1%, standing at the lowest level. Such digital divide may make it difﬁcult for senior citizens to enjoy the convenience of ICT technology use and set off generational conﬂict and income gaps. According to the United Nations, Korea has now become an aged society with senior citizens aged 65 and over accounting 14% out of the total population. This means that the increase in the elderly population and the digital divide should be regarded not as a temporary problem facing individuals or families but as a social problem to be addressed by all of members of Korean society. Since 2007, SK Telecom has been running the ‘Happy Mobile World Program’ by operating a college student volunteer group who helps the older generation learn how to use mobile phones. In 2018, it was expanded and reorganized into an ICT education project for senior citizens of the ‘Happy Community Project.’ Under the goal of resolving social problems by sharing SK Telecom’s infrastructure, the Happy Community Project launched ICT education programs for local communities at 30 direct retail shops and 24 direct retail shops in Seoul Metropolitan area, respectively. At each retail shop where the program is implemented, 2 staff members trained as smartphone class instructors teach the older generation how to use applications for ﬁnance, checking bills and making reservations and smart devices. Efforts to resolve the digital divide against senior citizens will not only improve their information and communication accessibility, helping to solve social problems but also positively affect long-term proﬁtability improvement of various business models of SK Telecom. If the annual average growth rate of smartphone subscribers (9.75%) among those over 60 is maintained, the smartphone use ratio will exceed 90% at the end of 2019. Accordingly, it is forecast that at least one million feature phone users will switch to smartphone subscribers from the end of 2018 to the end of 2020, resulting in annual revenue growth of approximately KRW 161.4 billion. &$6( 5(62/9,1*',*,7$/',9,'(2)6(1,25&,7,=(16 &$6(
According to the Road Trafﬁc Authority, ‘non-compliance with safe driving’ provoked about 120,000 trafﬁc accidents in 2017, which killed approximately 3,000 people. ‘Failure to comply with safety driving’ includes activities that interfere with safe 
driving such as distractions due to mobile phone use and watching DMB TV while driving. The failure was blamed for about 70% of all fatalities caused by trafﬁc accidents in 2017. SK Telecom set out to reduce the casualties caused by such kinds of trafﬁc accidents. In September 2017, SK Telecom launched a service that allows users to change their destinations with voice commands to the AI platform NUGU on T map in September 2017. In February 2018, V2X technology was applied to prevent the drivers from the potential accidents. T map V2X AI is a technology that acknowledges sudden brake of foregoing vehicle using T map and automatically alerts following vehicles using T map within maximum range of 1km through motion sensors in smartphone, GPS information and big data. With the alert from T map, the driver of following vehicle is able to prevent accidents by gradually decelerating, even in circumstances of low visibility. Since its launch, T map V2X has delivered 100,000 alarms a month to users, helping to prevent major accidents and secondary collisions. Based on these achievements, T map V2X took home the prize from the Minister of Science and ICT at ‘The 18th Mobile Technology Awards’ in December 2018 and won ‘the Best Innovation Mobile App Prize’ at the GSMA Global Mobile Awards, a sub-event of the MWC (Mobile World Congress) in Barcelona in 2019. SK Telecom is working with various stakeholders to promote the creation of social value through business models as well as T map technology. In 2019, the company launched T map taxi app for taxi drivers with hearing loss, called the ‘Quiet Taxi Program’ to help them work in a better working environment by collaborating with a social enterprise, ‘Coactus.’ Whereas other taxi applications are mainly designed for general taxi drivers, which made it difﬁcult for taxi drivers with hearing loss to use, T map taxi app is loaded with functions that provide convenience for drivers with hearing loss such as a blink notiﬁcation function for preventing call drops, and a message function for communication between drivers and passengers. Moreover the app provides a visible 'call-accept button' which is a functions that enables a taxi driver with hearing loss to easily accept a call while driving. 7+(0267,1129$7,9(02%,/($33p70$3q

SK Telecom is applying the Double Bottom Line approach throughout the management decision-making system, 
which  pursues an integration of ﬁnancial performance, based on revenue, operating proﬁts, and social perfor-
mance based on achievements in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. 
Unlike a single bottom line, which only measures and manages economic value and ﬁnancial performances, the 
Double Bottom Line sets social value as the second bottom line and uses it as a corporate performance index. 
SK Telecom believes it is a meaningful step to take the lead in resolving social problems through companies’ 
professional capacities and infrastructure by reﬂecting social value in the decision-making process and using 
it as metrics of successful management. SK Telecom is endeavoring to evaluate and calculate the impacts of 
social costs and beneﬁts that are not directly derived from social value generated by management activities, 
in line with SK Group’s Double Bottom Line measurement methodology.
However, because the social value created by management activities is so extensive, there are certain limita-
tions in quantifying comprehensive impact, as well as difﬁculties in standardizing value measurement method-
ologies. Thus, SK Telecom is building a companywide social value system and is enhancing the Double Bottom 
Line measurement methodology by communicating with stakeholders.62&,$/9$/8(0($685(0(172)6.7(/(&20

Although the reason for existence of 
companies were only focused on ‘profit seeking’ in the past, these days corporate social responsibility and corporate citizenship are getting more emphasized - the positive impacts of corporate activities on society and the value of those activities are considered as key factors that determine the sustainable growth and survival of companies. SK Group set the Double Bottom Line as its core business strategy to consider both economic and social value and has been building a performance measurement and management system based on it.$3352$&+

SK Telecom’s corporate philosophy is based on the idea that success measurement metrics of business operations should take into account not only financial achievements but also social value creation that considers society and stakeholders in a comprehensive manner. The company wants to achieve problem-solving and value-creation processes through an approach for social value measurement and performance analysis. We suggested companies’ leading roles in realizing social value by applying a sophisticated social value measurement methodology to a wider area in May 2019 after the start of social value through SE P&L analysis in 2017, and we are leading the way in building a sustainable corporate ecosystem.9$/8(&5($7,21

SK Telecom’s various platform and solution services that are includ-
ed in the impact assessment are the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and resource consumption through the Factory Energy Management System (FEMS), the Building En-ergy Management System (BEMS), and recycling of T Rental phones.

The results of the proﬁt and loss analysis are calculated in mon-etary values. In the process of applying the social value measure-ment method, if negative impacts (e.g. environmental damage) are expected to be high between the ‘total amount (total amount of environmental impact)’ and ‘relative amount (reduction of environ-mental impacts of the previous period)’, we used the ‘total amount’ instead of the ‘relative amount’. However, in the case of calculating environmental value through products and services such as en-ergy management solution (the FEMS and BEMS), we used ‘relative amounts’ for energy saving and greenhouse gas reduction com-pared to general use, in order to recognize the environmental im-pact beneﬁts presented to clients and consumers as the company’s social performances. Meanwhile, when measuring the impact of greenhouse gas emis-sions in the process of enhancing the environmental value mea-surement, we recognized that the market price of the Emissions Trading Scheme does not reﬂect all the potential effects of global warming. Therefore, in order to return to the state before a negative environmental impact, we replaced it and calculated results with Eco-Cost* that measures costs incurred to improve the reliability of environmental impact measurement.In 2018, we intended to translate our business operations’ envi-
ronmental outcomes and impacts into monetary value. We applied 
a more comprehensive valuation approach of our environmental 
impact by extracting key environmental indicators from domestic 
and overseas research articles and applying them to energy, water, 
greenhouse gas and waste emissions of 2017 and 2018. SK Telecom 
will strive to continue sophisticating methodology of measuring 
the social value of corporate activities through promoting advance-
ments of social/environmental impact calculation methodologies.SK Group’s Double Bottom Line established a value measurement 
index consisting indicators of ‘ﬁnancial performance’ to calculate economic value, ‘business social performance,’ ‘social performance through social contribution (additional social performance)’, and ‘economic social performance,’ to measure social value. In par-ticular, we measure social value by setting ‘business social per-
formances’ indicators as our fundamental performance indicators 
and categorize them into environmental operations, environmental 
products and services and social areas. 
As a result, SK Telecom produced integrated performances by ana-
lyzing ﬁnancial performances (net proﬁt) as economic performanc-
es and conducting social-environmental proﬁt and loss analysis of 
business social performances as social performances. 
In 2018, we maintained indicators used for the Environmental Proﬁt & 
Loss calculation as reported in the 2017 Annual Report, applied the 
data for 2018, and made improvements in calculation methodologies. 
As of June 2019, SK Telecom is continuously advancing the social value 
measurement methodology as well as accumulating comparative data.

SK Telecom’s environmental proﬁt and loss analysis uses a step-by-
step calculation method to measure the environmental impact of 
the entire value chain. In order to analyze the environmental proﬁt 
and loss of SK Telecom, we used three stages: setting the scope of 
the value chain, collecting data and calculating value.6HWWLQJ6FRSHDQG'DWD&ROOHFWLRQ
SK Telecom identiﬁed environmental data from the viewpoint of Life 
Cycle Assessment (LCA) such as collection, production, operation, 
use and disposal of raw materials by selecting buildings, networks, 
employees, handsets, services and solutions as categories on the value chain for the analysis of environmental proﬁt and loss. Along 
the value chain of buildings and networks, which includes raw ma-
terial collection, production, operation, use and disposal stages, we 
only included the data of the operating phases in the calculation 
because the data can be tracked and is continuously being man-
aged. As for the handsets, we collect data of Samsung and Apple 
models, which are the most popular models among subscribers, 
based on the results of life cycle environmental impact assess-
ments that are disclosed in the environmental certiﬁcations by the 
manufacturers, and apply the data to the number of all SK Telecom 
subscribers. Environmental social performance during the manu-
facturing processes are categorized into resource consumption and 
environmental pollution. We measured the total results of resource 
consumption by water usage/emissions and environmental unit 
costs. In the case of environmental pollution, we also measured the 
total results of environmental pollution by classifying pollutants 
as waste and greenhouse gas emissions. Air pollution and water 
pollution can also be included in the category of environmental 
pollution, but we excluded them because they are not applicable 
to our operations.

example, T map Safe Driving leads to social performances that lower the accident rates and creates a safe trafﬁc environment. However, as performance cannot be determined through the direct valuation meth-od, we calculated the value of safe environment creation by calculating the cost of handling trafﬁc accident damages before and after use.    In the case of the LBS IoT business (electronic anklets) and block-ing text and voice spam, we measured the effects of social cost reduction caused by crime prevention based on the direct valuation method. We have determined the reduction in the crime rate due to electronic ankle monitor devices, and the resulting reduction of costs caused by crimes was measured as a reduction in social costs. As a result, we have estimated the social value of expanding social safety nets based on the ICT technology.

The results of the social-environmental proﬁt and loss analysis 
which is calculated by combining the environmental proﬁt and 
loss analysis and social proﬁt and loss analysis are as follows. SK 
Telecom recorded a net income of KRW 933.9 billion in 2018. In 
the course of business operation, we estimated the environmental 
impact of buildings, networks, employee business travel, and the 
environmental impact of the handset manufacturing-use-disposal 
phase by applying the domestic standard environmental costs to 
estimate an environmental net loss of about KRW 147.8 billion. In 
the service area, we recorded an environmental cost of KRW 2.5 bil-
lion through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and energy 
using an energy management system (FEMS and BEMS) and the 
reduction of resource consumption through the reuse of T rental 
phones. As a result, our environmental net loss stood at KRW 145.3 
billion.     &$6(
Consumer surplus is an amount calculated when the actual price is deducted from a price customers are willing to pay for 
services. Therefore, the calculation of consumer surplus implies that customers are provided with a higher level of value than the actual amount paid for telecommunication rates. We interpret it as the result of SK Telecom’s continued efforts of customer-centered innovation to provide beneﬁts customers can experience.SK Telecom’s consumer surplus measurement is based on a methodology introduced in ‘An Analysis of Mobile Telecomm. 
Market`s Consumer Surplus and Dead-Weight Cost’ study by Chuwan Park and Sungsoo Han, 2014. The study calculates consumer surplus through mobile telecommunications sales and price elasticity of demand
(*) and uses the Consumer Price 
Index as a variable over time. Therefore, SK Telecom factored the Consumer Price Index(**) into calculating its mobile network 
business revenue and calculated consumer surplus by using the price elasticity of demand. As a result, the consumer surplus generated by SK Telecom’s mobile telecom business in 2018 was evaluated at KRW 10.941 trillion. In 2018, SK Telecom shifted its paradigm of marketing competition and strove to maximize customer beneﬁts and consumer surplus. The company launched eight services, including a contract-free plan, worry-free roaming, the reorganization of its membership programs, and a T Plan based on the customer value innovation program and expanded the range of services available to customers and increased the amount of actual services such as data and roaming services without raising charges. In addition, we put forth efforts to innovate customer value and stabilize the market by cutting costs through advanced marketing.Breaking away from the competition to raise market share and attract customers in an oligopolistic consumption market, SK Telecom will make continuous efforts to enhance customer satisfaction by making customer value innovation a top priority in the mobile network operations business. We will enhance customer loyalty and trust through providing more value and convenience to our customers by diversifying beneﬁts and optimal services to maximize consumer surplus through innovation of business models.
(*)    Price elasticity of demand: This is the ratio of change in demand that shows how demand changes according to the price change o f goods and services. In this report, 
the research on price elasticity of demand in the mobile communication sector (An Analysis of Mobile Telecom. Market’s Consumer  Surplus and Dead-Weight Cost in 
Korea) was referred to for the calculation of consumer surplus.

In February 2018, SK Telecom established a corporate governance 
charter that outlines its corporate governance principles based on 
its commitment to sound and transparent corporate governance and 
responsible management. SK Telecom’s corporate governance char-
ter stipulates that the company pursues enhancement of the value 
of stakeholders including shareholders based on continuous growth 
and development. Based on these principles, SK Telecom strives to 
protect the interests of shareholders through the establishment and 
operation of a balanced corporate governance structure, and ulti-
mately to enhance future corporate value. The company’s corporate 
governance charter, which can be found on our website, conforms 
with the best practice standards of corporate governance of Korea 
Corporate Governance Service (KCGS).
&RUSRUDWH*RYHUQDQFH0RGHO
SK Telecom maintains transparency in decision-making and estab-
lishes and maintains a global, independent governance structure 
that conducts effective management activities based on checks and 
balances centered by the board of directors. The BOD is committed 
to maintaining transparency, independence, diversity, expertise, 
and efﬁciency aimed at raising long-term corporate value through 
the realization of shareholder returns through stable management 
activities and proﬁt generation and implementation of growth strat-
egies through strategic decision-making.
SK Telecom follows the guidelines of the Corporate Governance 
Code from Korea Corporate Governance Service (KCGS) - the com-
pany was selected as a top honors company in corporate gover-
nance assessments conducted by KCGS for ﬁve consecutive years, from 2006 to 2010. In addition, the BOD has been maintaining an 
comprehensive rating of A or higher level every year in KCGS codes 
for ESG practices since 2011 for its responsible and transparent 
management efforts. In 2018, the company obtained the highest 
level of corporate governance among listed companies in Korea as 
it acquired an A+, which is only given to the top 1% in the evaluation 
of governance and integrated ESG evaluation.

SK Telecom protects the exercise of shareholder rights, guarantees equitable treatment of all shareholders, including 
minority shareholders and foreign shareholders and respects shareholder rights in accordance with laws and articles 
of incorporation. The company adopts a concentrated voting system through its articles of incorporation to ensure 
independence in electing directors and accept the opinions of general shareholders who are not controlling shareholders. 
In February 2018, the company introduced the electronic voting system in accordance with the BOD’s decision to 
enhance voting rights of minority shareholders, for the ﬁrst time in the domestic telecommunications industry. In March 
2018, SK Telecom put the system into practice for the ﬁrst time among all mobile telecommunications companies in 
Korea. Moreover, as our efforts to enhance convenience for the exert of shareholder rights, since 2018, we have held 
annual general meetings of shareholders on days avoiding the last Friday of the month, which are crowded days where 
other corporates generally hold their shareholders’ meetings in Korea.
At the 35th general meeting of shareholders on March 26, 2019, SK Telecom expanded the expertise and independence 
of the BOD by appointing independent director Kim Seok Dong and members of the Audit Committee in addition to 
the approval of ﬁnancial statements. Moreover, the general meeting of shareholders implemented the management 
oversight function by approving the remuneration limit of the director and stock options of the executives. In particular, 
since the beginning of 2019, we have been signiﬁcantly expanding shareholder-friendly factors in order to transform 
our general meeting of shareholders into a place for substantial communications with shareholders. The company 
changed the call-up notice, which previously was only a formality, to the Letter to Shareholders from the CEO, so 
that shareholders can receive sufﬁcient information on SK Telecom's key management performance and direction of 
management in 2019, in prior to the meeting. 
Before the opening ceremony, the company gave a demonstration of its state-of-the-art ICT technology and 5G services 
to its shareholders. In the general meeting of shareholders, the old practice of approving an agenda with a gavel was 
abolished. Jung Ho Park, CEO of SK telecom, and the managers of four major business units - MNO, media, security 
and commerce – each presented the 2018 business performances and 2019 management plans and visions to the 
shareholders. After the presentations, the company provided a Q&A session for shareholders to ask questions or 
inquiries to the SK Telecom executives for their managerial plans. SK Telecom will continue to endeavor to provide 
shareholders  with  transparent  management  information  and  communicat e  with  them  in  an  honest  manner  at  the  
general meeting of shareholders.

cash dividends based on company performances and the growth of corporate value based on continuous growth. To 
this end, we make efforts to increase corporate value based on the principle of capital management which maintains 
a balance between investment for growth and shareholder return. 
The amount of dividends is determined comprehensively based on business performances, investment plans, ﬁnancial 
conditions and forecasts. Dividends can be paid to shareholders in the form of cash (or cash equivalents) or stocks 
in accordance with the company’s articles of incorporation. In the case of issuing stock dividends, if the company has 
issued several series of stocks, the company may decide the series of new stocks to be issued as dividends through a 
resolution at the general meeting of shareholders. The company pays dividends to shareholders or registered pledgees 
listed in the shareholders’ register as of the end of a ﬁscal year, interim dividends are paid on June 30 according to a 
resolution by the BOD. Since 2015, we have raised the total dividend per share to KRW10,000 per share including an 
interim dividend. The dividend yield as the end of 2018 recorded 3.7%.

According to relevant laws and the SK Telecom Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors has been given the highest 
decision-making authority related to the company’s management from the shareholders. The Board holds the responsibility 
and role as the highest decision-making body and thus mediates diverse stakeholders’ interests and approves management 
decisions. Furthermore, the Board undertakes the deliberation and approval of matters such as company’s investment 
plans and conﬂicts of interest related to the internal transactions as well as transparent compensation. When holding a BOD meeting or a BOD committee meeting, the company enhances its operational expertise in managing the BOD by 
forming supporting organizations, such as the secretariat of the BOD, which fully explains the status of management and 
the contents of each agenda, answers questions and provides related data in advance for directors’ reviews. $&&2817$%,/,7< | *29(51$1&(5(3257

SK Telecom is geared towards appointing board members and form the BOD in consideration of diversity, independence, 
expertise and industrial experience. In order to ensure the diversity of our employees and stakeholders to be represented 
by the BOD, the company has put in place a process for selecting directors that can actively factor diversity into 
recommending and electing directors. SK Telecom does not discriminate candidates or nominees of the BOD on the 
basis of gender, races, ethnicity, national origins, or nationalities, as set forth in our diversity policy. In addition, as an  
ICT company that constantly requires innovation, the company is recommending and selecting candidates for directors 
who can complement skill gaps of the BOD. In particular, we are concentrating on securing professional skill balance and 
diversity of the BOD by maintaining the ratio of directors with industry experience at a certain level. As of March 2019, 
the average term of BOD members is 3 years, and there are 8 industry experts on the board. In addition, we provide 
extra training to independent directors in order to provide sufﬁcient information on SK Telecom’s business and strategy,

The evaluation of job performances of the management including the CEO takes place in a comprehensive manner 
in consideration of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial performances. In particular, starting from 2019, SK Telecom increased 
the proportion of social value in the CEO’s KPI up to 50% to reinforce the management’s sense of responsibility for 
creating social value. In addition, the company will factor the results of SK Telecom’s annual social value measurement 
and social value strategies into evaluation. Through this, SK Telecom aims to enhance long-term corporate value by 
pursuing business model innovation based on social value in addition to non-ﬁnancial performances to prevent social 
justice and corporate risk. Furthermore, we evaluate the performances of internal and external directors, utilize the 
results of the evaluation when considering reappointing them or for the recommendation of them by the Independent 
Director Candidate Recommendation Committee after the end of their terms. The annual performance evaluation of 
independent directors checks their BOD and committee meeting attendance rates, business and technological expertise 
related to the company and contribution levels and whether or not they enthusiastically carried out BOD activities.

The remuneration of executives, including the CEO, is calculated based on the performance within the limits determined 
at the general shareholders’ meeting. Directors’ salaries and severance pays are paid fairly and transparently through 
a resolution at the general shareholders’ meeting. Remuneration is consisting of Target Incentives and Proﬁt Sharing. 
When calculating remuneration, performance-based compensation of up to 200% of an annual salary is determined by a 
comprehensive evaluation of measurable indicators, such as ﬁnancial performances including revenue, operating proﬁt 
and EVA and non-measurable indicators composed of leadership, strategic task achievement, professionalism and other 
company management performances. Meanwhile, SK Telecom provides stock options in order to match management’s 
interests and shareholders’ interests and to provide compensation in a responsible manner in accordance with mid to 
long-term performances. In addition, we have established and currently operating a system which pursues longer-term 
performances by setting the vesting period up to maximum of 4 years. To enhance the transparency of the management 
and directors’ remuneration including the CEO, SK Telecom discloses the status of individual compensation payments 
to directors and auditors who have been paid over KRW 0.5 billion since 2014 through its business reports.

SK Telecom is establishing a risk management process consisting of evaluation planning, risk assessment, risk handling 
and risk collection reporting amid changes in the internal and external environments and according to the needs of 
stakeholders. The company sophisticatedly performs risk management based on collaboration between risk managers 
responsible for overall risk assessment and progress monitoring and process managers responsible for the overall 
management of risks and opportunities and management review reports, based on approved risk evaluation plan.
Among them, the risk evaluation process is conducted in the order of identiﬁcation, analysis and level determination, 
and aims to create risk opportunities, analysis results and priorities by stages. Risk identiﬁcation is a process of 
ﬁnding, identifying and describing factors that cause risks. This process is implemented in consideration of internal 
and external issues and stakeholder needs relevant to the organization’s objectives and strategic directions. It covers a 
wide range of risks and opportunities that affect the achievement of management targets if needed, and manages the 
number of risks/opportunities identiﬁed as the core achievements. Risk analysis is the process of understanding the 
characteristics of identiﬁed risks and determines the impacts on risks and opportunities and deﬁnes the possibility of 
the company facing them as high, medium or low. The ﬁnal stage of risk-level determination involves analysis of risk 
criteria and a comparison of the results to determine the acceptability and level of risk. This will determine the need 
for dealing with risk and priorities based on risk impact and the likelihood of occurrence.
Then, we map out appropriate risk management and action plans through risk management processes including 
decisions on risk management methodology and effectiveness assessment. Risk that has undergone risk evaluation 
and the risk management process is collected and reported and used in producing management review reports.  
Collected risk analysis is stored for ﬁve years on the Twiki System, a data-sharing DB, and comes in handy as an 
effective asset for SK Telecom’s future risk management strategies. 
The range of SK Telecom’s company-wide risk management widely covers strategic risks and ﬁnancial risks (the market, interest rates, taxation, foreign exchange rates), regulation risks, business operation risks such as serious customer 
complaints, customer information leakages and network failures and reputational (social responsibility) risks that 
can affect the company’s reputation such as unfair trade, bribery, and treats. As a result, we have the wide scope of 
comprehensive and systematic management that takes into consideration both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial risks. We 
are expanding the strategic response system based on the key elements of each area and changes in the internal 
and external environments by dividing the risk management area into business, employees, customer value, business 
partners, and governance.

A risk management culture internalized in all members and organizations of SK Telecom such as employees, executives, 
and the BOD, should be created in addition to the risk management system in order to effectively manage and respond 
to risks. SK Telecom is creating an environment in which members can promptly report risks when they detect risks so 
that its employees can ramp up their transparency and accountability regarding risk. In addition, we are enhancing our 
employees’ preemptive risk response capabilities by identifying risks of which impacts are increasing in the mid-to-
long term and by conducting periodic simulation training along with precautionary risk recognition training. Moreover, 
we are constantly improving our risk management practices by sharing risk analysis data collected in course of risk 
management process through the system. We are also operating a risk management system that includes risks that are 
difﬁcult to predict but can have a huge impact in the long term, such as climate change and natural disasters, within 
the scope of risk management. Since 2014, SK Telecom has been strengthening its risk management system by operating a company-wide crisis

risk that can have a serious impact on the company and its business operations such as a sharp rise in media and SNS

center of market competition to quality of products and service 
while easing customer inconvenience simultaneously.•  NGOs and political circles have steadily demanded for rate 
discounts for the purpose of easing telecommunication expense 
burdens on households.
•  Due to regulatory pressure from 2017 to 2018, the government 
expanded tariff discount on socially disadvantage and 
increased selective tariff discount rate. In the mid-to-long term,

•  SK Telecom is consuming a substantial amount of electricity 
at data centers and network systems to operate networks 
and base stations, thereby needs to closely manage energy 
efficiency and GHG emissions are increasing.
•  In particular, the government’s relatively low GHG emissions 
allocation volume compared to the BAU level and long-term 
uncertainties in the Emissions Trading Scheme may burden SK 
Telecom financially, through environmental debts as well as 
negatively impact our business operations in the future - we 
are paying close attention to this issue.•  As climate change risk has emerged as a major global agenda, 
risks related to securing emission allowances and operating 
costs related to electricity charges are rising due to the 
strengthening of climate change related regulations including 
Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and renewable energy 
development.
•  As the post-Kyoto Protocol was completed at the COP21 (Paris 
Pact) at the end of 2015, the government has set national 
greenhouse gas emissions reduction target to 37% compared to 
Business as Usual (BAU) by 2030, and is strengthening market 
and non-market regulations.
•  The government announced the nuclear phase-out policy in 
2017 and the roadmap for promoting renewable energy and 
improving the national energy system.
•  At the same time, the world is witnessing the creation of ICT-
based eco-friendly business opportunities such as Next Grid to 
prevent the growing risk of climate change and improvement on 
energy efficiency.Emerging•  SK Telecom is continuing to have discussions with the Corporate Citizenship 
Committee of the BOD in order to actively respond to the Emissions Trading 
Scheme. In addition to its own activities to reduce GHG emissions, SK Telecom 
is preparing diversified countermeasures such as mitigating price risks through 
dispersed purchasing arrangements of emission allowances, calling for the 
recognition of the early reduction of GHG emissions in the 2012-2013 period, and 
applying for the additional allocation of GHG emission allowances due to new 
equipment introduced in 2017.
•  In 2018, SK Telecom signed an agreement to lead locals to prune approximately 
106,000 tons of carbon emissions annually by supplying about 54,000 cook 
stoves to a dry zone in Myanmar for five years via the Myanmar Cook Stove* 
project. The company will create both social and economic value in the form of 
securing carbon credits for the portion of carbon emissions reduced through this 
project by promoting this as a UN Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) model. 
•  We are pursuing various eco-efficiency projects based on data such as the 
Building Energy Management System (BEMS), the Factory Energy Management 
System (FEMS) and various ICT-based smart/green solutions by approaching 
climate change risk from a new market opportunity perspective.

by establishing a Code of Conduct that underpins ethical manage-
ment. Hence, a thorough zero-tolerance principle is applied and 
actions are strictly taken against minor violations. The company 
publishes guidelines on ethical management and putting ethical 
management into practice and uses them as a basis for decision-
making and actions in all management activities. Following an 
amendment to the Code of Ethics in November 2017, we revised the

SK Telecom conducts ethical management practice surveys in order to preemptively identify potential risk in ethical 
management and improve vulnerable areas. Annual regular diagnosis of ethical management practice precludes all 
employees of companies from being exposed to unethical risk. In 2018, SK Telecom improved its practice of corporate 
ethics management by deriving improvement tasks based on the results and feedback derived from annual regular 
diagnosis. In particular, SK Telecom has empowered executives to take the lead in putting ethical management into 
practice at each of their units by giving them feedback on awareness gaps with members of their units by segments 
and the members’ opinions.  
Furthermore, we are carrying out company-wide education activities for preventive checks to counter potential risk 
and the internalization of ethical management practices. We regularly implement ethical practice pledges and ethics 
education for all employees, and established the Code of Practice Guidelines marching the speciﬁc characteristics of 
each organization through ethical management practice workshops in which all employees participate. We expanded 
ethical management education to partner companies, distribution networks and investment companies to spread our 
ethical management culture in all of our business activities. We issue an ethical practice letter every other month to 
provide speciﬁc guidelines on ethical practice. In 2018, we held a total of 23 ethical management training sessions 
for 95 groups at 13 business centers. We are achieving nearly 100% participation rate and ethical management 
internalization. SK Telecom is carrying out inspections on ethical management issues identiﬁed through reporting channel and 
monitoring in serial order through 27 internal control audit support scenarios based on the SK Group Ethical Management 
Policy (2015). In 2018, we developed 20 of the 27 scenarios as automatically inspected items in our ethical management 
portal, thereby establishing a self-check and constant monitoring system for individual departments. In addition, we 
check whether or not leaders take the initiative in putting ethical management into practice by setting an example and 
conduct ethical management diagnoses and audits to reconsider ineffectiveness in our business areas. In particular, 
we conducted a diagnosis and an audit on the status of all corporate receivables and inventory asset management and 
beneﬁts for customers and took corrective measures in 2018.

In case of a violation of ethics regulations, SK Telecom ﬁnds facts through further investigations when necessary and takes strict measures such as dismissal, suspension from duty and reprimand through consultation with related 
departments based on general company rules such as personnel management and disciplinary regulations. If an 
employee of a partner company violates the ethics regulations, SK Telecom imposes restrictions on the amount of 
transactions with the partner company, in some cases terminates the contract as well as records-keeping for further 
inspections and improvements.

SK Telecom operates the Ethics Counseling Center to enable employees to regularly report ethical management issues 
and receive counseling. SK Telecom opens online and ofﬂine channels such as a corporate website, face-to-face 
counseling and mail correspondence available to all of SK Telecom’s stakeholders including employees, customers and 
partner companies that need to report ethical management issues and receive counseling. These channels include My 
Counselor, Letter to HR, female counselors for sexual harassment cases, intranet channels and anonymous message boards and serve not only as a window through which to report misconduct and corruptions, but also as a tool to provide consulting about various ethical issues that stakeholders face. In addition, the company operates a separate 
counseling and witness protection program to protect the identity of informants and counselors of ethical concerns as 
well as conﬁdential information. Under no circumstances SK Telecom is allowed to make an attempt to reveal a person’s 
identity, such as inquiries or investigations to ﬁnd out the identity of the person who have reported. Moreover, we 
protect the identity of not only the counseled person but also the counsel/investigation collaborator as well as the 
details of the counseling report. SK Telecom is taking measures to prevent any disadvantages caused by counseling

SK Telecom recognized that it is a prerequisite for enhancing corporate competitiveness by actively creating a fair 
competition environment and contributing to the protection of users, rather than passively complying with related laws 
and regulations by regulating organizations. Accordingly, we are setting up a leading compliance system by regularly 
conducting compliance training for our employees and disclosing the status of training.

Since 2002, SK Telecom has been running the Self-Regulating Compliance Program, an internal compliance system 
for fair competition and transaction transparency. The Fair Trade Compliance Program consists of the CEO’s voluntary 
commitment to compliance, the appointment of a compliance ofﬁcer, the establishment of a self-regulating compliance 
council, the creation of a compliance manual and training program, the construction of a material management system, 
and internal inspections. SK Telecom is contributing to the creation of a fair competition environment through systematic 
management and operation in accordance with standard guidelines. In addition, when signing contracts with partners, 
we make it compulsory for partners to comply with fair trade including fair and transparent transactions in the CSR 
practice agreement. Fair trade compliance standards for partner companies are common regardless of their countries 
or regions. If a partner company does not adhere to these rules or comply with them, SK Telecom is strictly complying 
with standards such as eliminating the partner company from our partner list or scratching off a contract with it.

The SK Group to which SK Telecom belongs enacted the SK Compliance System Guidelines in 2008 and has distributed 
it to each afﬁliated company to strengthen its fair trade system. SK Telecom has not paid any ﬁnes for breaching fair 
trade practices in 2018. SK Telecom will lead the establishment of a compliance system for the entire ICT industry with 
the belief that spreading a fair trade culture and creating an environment for self-regulating fair competition are the 
driving forces of sustainable competitiveness and customer trust down the road.For the transparency of political funds, SK Telecom abides by domestic political funding laws that prohibit corporations 
or organizations from donating political funds. We do not provide any political funding, including political funds, election 
funds for speciﬁc political groups, and lobbying funds of political parties. We are cooperating for the development of 
the public interest by supporting organizations with guaranteed political neutrality. In addition, SK Telecom supports 
public policies such as job creation, gender equality, the protection of socially vulnerable groups, and complies with 
anti-corruption and fair trade. 
We also recognize that expenses associated with policy impacts can be a potential risk to the company’s mid- to long-
term business perspectives and manage the history and size of donations from the perspective of the entire company. 
In February 2017, the Board of Directors revised the rules to enhance the fairness and transparency of the execution of 
expenses that could affect business policies by strengthening the pre-approval process through the Board of Directors’ 
oversight on donations of over KRW 1 billion. &203/,$1&( 75$163$5(173$57,&,3$7,21,138%/,&32/,&<$&&2817$%,/,7< | ,17(*5,7<5(3257

SK Telecom takes the utmost care to prevent either the company’s

communication technology ultimately contributes to improving 
quality of life and human rights by enhancing information exchang-
es among individuals and their access to information and improving 
social knowledge, openness and transparency.
The company is committed to respecting human rights in the Uni-

Principles on Business and Human Rights into the overall business 
process. For the CEO's statement on SK Telecom's human rights

The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights suggest a clear framework for promoting human rights in 
business processes for companies and stakeholders. They are ‘Protect, Respect, Remedy’ that expect companies to 
respect human rights, strive to prevent human rights infringements, and actively eliminate negative human rights 
issues.
SK Telecom introduced human rights policies at the corporate level in 2012 and since then, has continuously strengthened 
its management in the human rights ﬁeld. The company recognizes the following four as key human rights factors 
related to its business - 1) human rights of employees and business partners; 2) the protection of personal information 
and privacy; 3) the freedom of access and expression and 4) the prevention of technology, service and data misuse. In 
this regard, SK Telecom is checking whether there are even small human rights risks in its entire value chains involving 
SK Telecom, its subsidiaries, and partners.

SK Telecom reestablished the priorities of human rights issues  by conducting a gap analysis which compares its 
human rights policy with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  Its human rights risk identiﬁcation 
procedure is 1) investigating human rights issues in accordance with global guidelines such as OECD due diligence 
guidelines on conﬂict minerals and industry guidelines; 2) tracking human rights issues of 3rd-parties through the 
Global Human Rights Action Platform and NGOs;  3) identifying  internal issues through annual stakeholder surveys 
and 4) generally reviewing integrated grievance resolutions through the Corporate Citizenship Committee of the BOD 
and CSR issue channels.

As a result of risk analysis in 2018, SK Telecom selected the following as major human rights issues -- 1) the conﬂict 
mineral issue at the stage of collecting raw materials for networks, devices and equipment; 2) safety and working hours 
of workers in network construction and operation; 3) the humanitarian treatment and protection of customer service 
consultants and 4) the protection of personal information in sales and distribution processes.
The relief and mitigation measures are designed to identify the status of the identiﬁed and prioritized human rights issues through due diligence and map each issues with dedicated organizations that measures can be continuously 
carried out. For example, the company takes an action so that an issue can be resolved such as having the SCM Ofﬁce deal with issues regarding conﬂict minerals which are main risk and the Customer Value Innovation Ofﬁce’s Customer

SK Telecom has built and operates 2.87 million base stations nationwide for its wireless communication network. In 
the course of carrying out data processing works and physical maintenance of the network, workers may be exposed 
to human rights issues related to accidents and working hours. 
SK O&S, a subsidiary of SK Telecom, continuously monitored the status of safety accidents at the company-wide level 
such as checking the status of safety equipment (helmets, etc.) use and carrying out a campaign for vehicle safety. In 
2018, we examined the status of safety by months and identiﬁed one major potential risk (related to electrical safety) 
and implemented corrective actions. With reference to working hours, one of the global human rights issues, became a 
major issue in Korea as an agreement was reached about shortening the statutory maximum working hours (including 
overtime). Changes in the telecommunication service environment will kindle an increase in the number of equipment and 
may lead to an increase in the working hours of network operators. SK is running a system where workers have to receive 
work permits from their team leaders and register the content of their work during holidays or night shifts. This system

The term ‘conﬂict minerals’ refers to minerals such as gold, tungsten, tin, and tantalum mined in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC) or its neighboring countries. As armed rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo raised 
funds through conﬂict minerals over the last 10 years, it became a major human rights issue in the telecommunications 
and electronics industries. The most important products that need much attention in relation to conﬂict minerals are 
electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops. Although SK Telecom does not manufacture electronic devices 
on its own, the company is identifying products’ countries of origin and conducting due diligence, utilizing CRMT 
(Conﬂict Minerals Reporting Template) provided by the RBA (Responsible Business Alliance, the former EICC) and the 
GeSI (Global e-Sustainability Initiative) to verify whether the materials, parts, or equipment supplied to SK Telecom 
contain conﬂict minerals. The results of the due diligence of our supply chain in 2018 did not show any direct purchase 
of conﬂict minerals and any direct contractual relationship with reﬁneries in the disputed area. Accordingly, we found 
that there were no production minerals in the conﬂict-areas subject to additional supply chain inspections.

SK Telecom took protective measures such as improving the treatment of service consultants and enhancing their work 
environment by regularly cooperating with its call center subsidiaries. Service consultants taking various calls from 
customers are vulnerable to emotional labor risk at all times and go through verbal abuse and profanity on an average 
of once or twice a month. 
SK Telecom's call center subsidiary is continuously improving its policy to protect service consultants from the negative 
impacts of emotional labor. The company set up and is implementing procedures (service consultant protection 
program) including understanding (warning), terminating conversations, and connecting to senior employees  when 
service consultants are exposed to human rights violation risks such as abusive language, profanity, intimidation,

Telecom companies may face the issue of violating indigenous land rights during a process of constructing base 
stations and network infrastructure. SK Telecom has low risk in violating such land rights, as more than 99% of the 
company’s revenue is generated in Korea, while there are currently no plans to advance overseas in the MNO business. 
When constructing domestic business sites, base stations, and network infrastructures, SK Telecom is conducting 
preventive reviews to prevent violations of residents’ rights as well as safety issues such as electromagnetic waves. 
In addition, SK Telecom receives cases of rights infringements through regular channels (customer centers, etc.) and

In order to protect personal information and prevent privacy violations, all business partners including branches of 
SK Telecom periodically diagnose the level of risk exposure and take corrective measures against risks that occurred. 
Since 2015, SK Telecom has conducted a survey on the personal information protection audit of over 3,800 stores of 
sales agencies in its marketing and solution distribution networks. The company conducts remote diagnosis of about 
20,000 PCs regarding information leaks annually. In 2018, we also implemented diagnoses and inspection of customer 
information all of our distribution network.
In order to prevent information leaks in the distribution network, SK Telecom selected and implemented four major 
tasks: strengthening regular diagnosis of distribution networks; reinforcing target diagnosis through data analysis; 
improving customer information handling processes; and raising the awareness of customer information protection. As 
part of carrying out the tasks, we diagnosed risks in blind spots in the distribution network and took measures about 
201 cases in 2018. The company found out 137 matters which need improving more diagnosis of customer information 
in the distribution network and improved the matters 100%.

In addition, SK Telecom operates the Mind Care program, which is a preliminary/follow-up program to understand service consultants’ job stress and their responses through one or more mental health examinations each year, and to continue personal and group consultation for those in high risk. In addition, in order to protect individual freedom and prevent stress, the company has been running a four-hour work system and a six-hour work system that allow employees to freely choose their working time since 2014.

SK Telecom designated a ‘Critical Supplier’ group with comprehensive consideration of transaction dependency and impact on SK Telecom’s ongoing business. SK Telecom’s critical suppliers are comprehensively managed and categorized 
according to 1) the relevance to the company’s core businesses and reliability, 2) high level of transaction volume and 3) 
possession of proprietary technologies for which substitution is not possible. As a result, about 228 out of a total of 1,357 
registered partner companies were classiﬁed into the Tier 1 critical supplier group in 2018.

SK Telecom produces the results of risk gap analyses and risk mapping by supplier groups based on risk factors that 
it ﬁnds through an internal risk identiﬁcation process which includes win-win growth satisfaction surveys (twice or 
more times a year) and holding meetings, listening to the voices of partners, and operating a risk management working 
group and reviews them in meetings to analyze and improve purchasing results every month. SK Telecom deﬁnes major 
risks from a supply chain perspective as follows and factors them in managing the supply chain sustainability process.(YDOXDWLRQRI6XSSO\&KDLQ(6*
SK Telecom considers the percentage of written surveys and on-site surveys carried out for registered suppliers as a key 
indicator in the ESG evaluation of the supply chain. In 2018, SK Telecom looked into 1,085 of 1,357 ﬁrst-tier suppliers 
on paper, conducted on-site visits for 197 suppliers (including direct visits and interviews with individual companies, 
and in-depth meetings, etc.) and third-party audits for 60 suppliers, which totals up to 93% of all registered suppliers. 
In addition, 216 companies participating in the company’s mutual growth agreements were assessed by third-party 
external auditors and evaluators in 2018, of which the Korean Commission for Corporate Partnership supervised. We 
are applying these policies and achievement indicators to all suppliers at home and abroad. Our overseas purchases 
account for KRW 26.5 billion (0.7%) of total purchases (about KRW 3,699.3 billion) and regional performance indicators 
are managed mainly in Korea. 
Through the electronic contract system (Open2U), SK Telecom has pre-screened all newly registered suppliers in 2018 
through the ‘Fair Trade/Transparent Transactions and CSR Practice Agreement.’ Moreover, SK Telecom conducted risk 
identiﬁcation and analysis for all of its ﬁrst-tier suppliers (1,357 companies) and its second-tier and above suppliers (49 
companies) in 2018. As for suppliers found exposed to high risk, SK Telecom conducted supply chain audits through 
100% on-site surveys or third-party audits for the purpose of preventing the occurrence of potential risk. 
Based on the results of diagnosis and evaluation of the suppliers, SK Telecom provides a capability improvement 
program and incentives to high performing suppliers. The capability improvement program that SK Telecom provides 
includes technical support and protection activities such as technology transfers and open collaboration, as well as SK 
Win-win Growth Academy, CEO seminars and MBA programs for suppliers and training for risk management. Training 
for risk management includes training on agreements for win-win growth, purchasing policies and policy compliance 
provided in education programs for suppliers. More speciﬁcally, SK Telecom adjusts supply unit prices, provides 
funding (ﬁnancial) assistance, technical and educational support and welfare beneﬁts as incentives and support 
programs for suppliers with excellent performances.

Using diagnosis and assessment results, SK Telecom mapped out a corrective measure plan for partner companies 
that need improvements and ask them to enhance their ESG performances accordingly. Despite these efforts, two 
companies received corrective measures according to the diagnosis and assessment results of partner companies in 
2018. Due to the seriousness of their policy violations such as violations of fair trade, transparent transactions and 
occurrence of non-ethical issues, SK Telecom permanently suspended business transactions with the two companies.

The order of priority in SK Telecom's purchasing strategy is as follows: 1) securing its fundamental purchasing 
competitiveness by improving its purchasing structure from a total cost ownership (TCO) perspective; 2) boosting cost efﬁciency by reviewing a zero-base view on cost structure; 3) optimizing and improving business-friendly purchasing 
processes; 4) creating a pre-purchase risk management and compliance environment and 5) expanding joint development 
and supporting overseas export and creating a fair trade environment with the goal of managing the sustainability of 
supply chains. In addition, we are actively promoting strategic purchases through a purchasing synergy council with SK 
Group subsidiaries and information and communication divisions of companies invested in by SK Telecom.
SK Telecom maximizes the creation of resources of our company and its business partners through the combination of 
the corporate procurement strategy and sustainability manage ment goals. In addition, the company is breaking away 
from unnecessary procedures, forms, practices, and so on, to optimize procurement strategy based on efﬁciency. 
Achieving our purchasing strategy through responsible supply chain risk management will be explained in the following 
business cases:6(&85,1*)81'$0(17$/385&+$6,1*&203(7,7,9(1(66

Data communication goes through the stages of a terminal ª a base station ª a switch ª 
the internet. When the manufacturer of equipment in a base station and the manufacturer of a switch are different, a telecommuncation company needs to optimize the quality of the equipment by connecting one another’s equipment. Since 2017, SK Telecom has developed technologies and standards that enable data transmission between 5G equipment from different manufacturers along with global carriers such as AT&T (US), Orange (France) in order to secure competitive edge in purchasing network equipment, which is a key purchase sourcing group from a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) perspective. This interlocking work is essential to achieving cost efﬁciency and early competitiveness as it can advance the commercialization of 5G by preparing interlocking standards in advance, and enables mobile carriers to utilize various manufacturers’ equipment (or ‘multi-vendor strategy’) in the 5G commercialization stage.In September 2018, SK Telecom began a test to interlock 5G equipment from Samsung Electronics, Nokia, and Ericsson. One month later, the company succeeded in interlocking Samsung switches of the 5G NSA standard with a 5G base station based on equipment from Nokia-Ericsson. The success allowed SK Telecom to build 5G base stations based on equipment from Nokia-Ericsson within the scope of Samsung switches and build 5G networks more ﬂexibly and efﬁciently. In particular, SK Telecom became able to build 5G networks by adding 5G functions to existing LTE switches through this interworking technology. Accordingly, we became able to support the early commercialization of 5G services and cut cost in building 5G networks by securing purchasing competitiveness through the expansion of existing suppliers’ capacities. SK Telecom plans to continue to develop related technologies and apply them to building networks to strengthen its purchasing power in the market down the road.
The domestic smart home industry is expected to steadily grow to KRW 40 trillion by 
2025. However, due to barriers surrounding the market led mainly by large companies, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have difﬁculty in developing smart home IoT devices. SK Telecom runs the Easy Ride-on program, a smart home technology support program that empowers small and medium-sized home appliance manufacturers to develop various smart home devices more easily. For instance, SK Telecom simpliﬁed its complex business alliance process so that SMEs could easily ﬁnish various steps such as partnership discussions and signing contracts at the Smart Home Website of SK Telecom. The simpliﬁcation shorted time for one model development from more than two weeks to less than one hour, saving developers time and money. In addition, SK Telecom has been supporting the development of SK Telecom-certiﬁed Wi-Fi modules by small and mid-sized manufacturers. Small and mid-sized manufacturers had difﬁculty in developing devices because they had no experience in designing Wi-Fi modules to connect to smart homes. Since the introduction of the Easy Ride-on program in 2018, small and medium-sized partners have developed a total of 20 smart home devices by making good use o f  the  program.  SK  T elecom  will  creat e  the  social  value  o f  mutual  growth  by  sharing  its technology with small and medium-sized business partners that need support and building a wider industrial ecosystem.

SK Telecom strictly complies with domestic and overseas tax laws and regulations in all transactions which aim at creating 
economic and social value in order to faithfully carry out liability to taxation and accurately reports and pays the tax amount to be paid in accordance with tax laws and regulations. In addition, the company discloses related information to stakeholders to ensure transparency in tax payment. In order to ensure the appropriateness of the application of the 
tax laws, the company is reporting tax amounts to the taxation items prescribed by laws and regulations through the accounting ﬁrm. In 2018, SK Telecom’s earnings before tax was KRW 3.976 trillion and the reported taxes amounted to KRW 1.083 billion at a reported tax rate of 27.2%. Meanwhile, the company’s real taxes amounted to KRW 844.0 billion at a real tax rate of 21.2%. During the past two years, the company’s average reported tax rate stood at 25.7% and the real tax rate was 21.6%. The real tax rate in 2018 was 6%p lower than the reported tax rate. The main reasons for this include the effects stemming from tax-exempt income, non-deductible expenses, and tax deductions and exemptions. This result is also attributable to changes in deferred income taxes that are not feasible, refunded income taxes from past periods, and the effect of tax rate ﬂuctuations.())(&7,9(7$;5$7(

In a wireless telecommunications industry currently deﬁned by fast-
paced advancements in the LTE network, we have emerged as the 
leader in the new information and communication technology (‘ICT’) 
era by launching innovative new products and services designed 
to meet customers’ evolving preferences and needs. We aim to 
maintain our leading position in the Korean market for wireless 
telecommunications services and actively develop our next-gener-
ation growth businesses in Media, Security, E-Commerce, Mobility, 
Internet of Things (‘IoT’) solutions. We plan to further utilize our big data analysis capabilities to create products and services that are 
tailored to our customers’ evolving needs, as well as incorporate ar-
tiﬁcial intelligence (‘AI’) capabilities directly into many of the prod-
ucts and services we offer.  We also aim to continue developing 
cutting-edge technologies that will be adopted as the technological 
standard for 5G services. In addition, we will seek to apply our 5G 
infrastructure and capabilities to our various other key businesses 
such as media, e-commerce and security to create unique new prod-ucts and services geared to serve evolving customer needs. 
Our operations are reported in four segments: (1) cellular services, (2) ﬁxed-line telecommunication services, (3) e-commerce services 
and (4) other businesses. 
&HOOXODU6HUYLFHV
We offer wireless voice and data transmission services, sell wire-
less devices and provide IoT solutions and innovative platform 
services through our cellular services segment. Our wireless voice 
and data transmission services are offered through our backbone 
networks that collectively can be accessed by approximately 99% 
of the Korean population. We maintained our leadership position in 
the wireless business in 2018 with 30.9 million subscribers (includ-
ing subscribers of mobile virtual network operators (‘MVNOs’) that 
lease our networks) as of December 31, 2018, of which approxi-
mately 24.8 million subscribed to our LTE service and 24.0 million 
used smartphones. Our share of the Korean wireless market based 
on the number of subscribers (including subscribers of MVNOs) was 
approximately 47.2% as of December 31, 2018 compared to 48.2% 
as of December 31, 2017.
 
The Korean wireless telecommunication industry is considered to 
have reached its maturation stage with more than a 100% pen-
etration rate. However, with continued advancements in network-
related technology, there are further opportunities to expand mar-
ket size and revenue of cellular services through increased quality 
of cellular services we provide to our subscribers. By continuing 
to be innovative in developing core competencies, we have ﬁrmly 
established our position as the market leader in wireless telecom-
munications. 
We continue to endeavor to strengthen our customer relationships 
by engaging our subscribers to integrate our service offerings in 
various aspects of their daily lives such as ‘T map,’ our interactive 
navigation service which we provide to all users free of charge and 
‘oksusu,’ our mobile OTT (over-the-top) service with a wide range 
of unique media offerings. We also provide bundled subscriptions 
to our wireless and ﬁxed-line service offerings, and we believe such bundled subscriptions contribute to increased customer retention 
and acquisition of new subscribers for both our wireless and ﬁxed-
line services due to convenience. In addition, we believe our ‘T 
Membership’ program, our membership service, also contributes 
to our subscriber retention with the breadth of membership ben-eﬁts we provide through our membership partners. We also offer 
AI solutions and in September 2016, we launched NUGU, the ﬁrst 
intelligent virtual assistant service launched in Korea with Korean 
language capabilities based on advanced voice recognition technol-
ogies.  We have integrated NUGU into our T map service as well as 
our IPTV service and launched a variety of NUGU-based smart de-
vices, including ‘NUGU candle,’ an AI light that offers NUGU-based 
services and changes its color and brightness based on the user’s 
needs and preferences.
In 2018, our cellular services segment revenue was KRW 12.38 tril-
lion, representing 73.3% of our consolidated operating revenue.

We offer ﬁxed-line telephone, broadband Internet and advanced 
media platform services (including IPTV and mobile OTT services) and business communications services through our ﬁxed-line tele-
communication services segment. Our ﬁxed-line telecommunication 
services are provided by our subsidiaries, SK Broadband and SK 
Telink. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4.1 mil-
lion ﬁxed-line telephone subscribers (including subscribers to VoIP 
services of SK Broadband and SK Telink), approximately 5.4 mil-
lion broadband Internet access subscribers and approximately 4.7 
million IPTV subscribers, with market shares of 16.0%, 25.4% and 
11.1%, respectively, based on the number of subscribers.  
As part of our initiative to be the leading next-generation platform 
provider, we aim to provide an advanced media platform with vari-
ous media content and service offerings. We currently offer IPTV 
services under the brand name ‘B tv’ with access to our standard 
56 live high deﬁnition channels and to as many as 236 channels 
depending on the subscription service, as well as video-on-demand 
service providing a wide range of media content, including recent 
box ofﬁce movie releases, popular U.S. and other foreign TV shows 
and various children’s TV programs. We also offer ‘B tv UHD,’ which 
is an ultra-high deﬁnition IPTV service and has a resolution that 
is four times as high as the standard high deﬁnition broadcasting 
service in the IPTV industry.  
Further, we provide mobile OTT services through ‘oksusu’ that provides 
subscribers’ access to a wide variety of media contents, including vari-
ous television programs, movies and other video contents that can be 
downloaded to wireless devices. Oksusu subscribers have access to more than 100 live TV channels, a wide range of sports contents and 
popular U.S. and other foreign TV shows, among other contents.  We 
are also collaborating with media content developers to provide origi-
nal media content for our oksusu service. As of December 31, 2018, we 
had approximately 9.7 million subscribers to oksusu. 
In April 2019, in furtherance of our efforts to enhance the competi-
tiveness of our media business and to promote its future growth, 
we entered into an agreement with Content Alliance Platform, a 
joint venture among the three major terrestrial broadcasters in Ko-
rea that operates the mobile OTT service POOQ, pursuant to which 
we will transfer our oksusu business to Content Alliance Platform 
to pursue a combination of the two mobile OTT services and par-
ticipate in a capital increase by Content Alliance Platform through 
a third-party allotment for a cash consideration of Won 90 billion.
In 2018, our ﬁxed-line telecommunication services segment revenue 
was KRW 2.93 trillion, representing 17.4% of our consolidated op-
erating revenue.

Our e-commerce services segment consists primarily of ‘11st,’ our 
online marketplace business, which was spun-off as our new con-
solidated subsidiary from SK Planet in September 2018.
11st is an online marketplace that offers a wide range of products 
through an online and mobile interface. As of December 31, 2018, 
11st was the leading commerce platform in Korea in terms of unique 
visitors, both on the basis of mobile version only and the combined 
basis of mobile and desktop versions, according to Nielsen Kore-
anclick. The mobile version of 11st is continuing to grow, with an 
increase in the percentage of annual gross merchandise volume, 
which represents the total annual monetary value of customer pur-
chases of goods and services, net of estimated refunds, to 65% in 
2018 from 61% in 2017.

Our operating expense in 2018 decreased by 1.9% to KRW 15.67 trillion from 15.98 trillion in 2017, primarily due to decreas-es in commissions, cost of goods sold and network interconnection expenses, which were partially offset by an increase in labor costs.

Our total assets increased by 26.7% to KRW 42.37 trillion as of De-cember 31, 2018 from KRW 33.43 trillion as of December 31, 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of new frequency usage rights for our 5G services and our acquisitions of ADT CAPS, SK Infosec and id Quantique during 2018. Total liabilities increased by 30.0% to KRW 20.02 trillion as of De-cember 31, 2018 from KRW 15.40 trillion as of December 31, 2017, primarily due to[the issuance of bonds by SK Telecom and an in-crease in long-term payables related to frequency usage rights.

Our operating revenue in 2018 decreased by 3.7% to KRW 16.87 tril-lion from KRW 17.52 trillion in 2017. This decrease was primarily at-tributable to a decrease in wireless service revenue as a result of the continued increase in the percentage of wireless service subscribers who elected to receive discounted rates in lieu of receiving handset subsidies and the decrease in revenues from our roaming services subsequent to the launch of our ‘Safe Automatic T Roaming’ service 
in March 2018.  Another reason for the decrease was the decrease in cellular interconnection revenue as a result of continued decreases in 
interconnection rates and land-to-mobile call volume.$538
SK Telecom’s average monthly revenue per subscriber excluding MVNO subscribers leasing SK Telecom’s networks (‘ARPU’) de-
creased by 7.6% to KRW 32,243 in 2018 from KRW 34,901 in 2017 
and average monthly revenue per subscriber including such MVNO 
subscribers (‘ARPU including MVNO’) decreased by 8.2% to KRW 
28,615 in 2018 from KRW 31,171 in 2017. These decreases were pri-
marily due to a decrease in revenue attributable to an increase in the number of subscribers who elected to receive discounted 
rates in lieu of receiving handset subsidies, the increase in such 
discount rate from 20% to 25% starting in September 2017, as well 
as the additional rate discounts offered to low income customers, including those on government welfare programs and senior citizen 
recipients of the basic pension, starting in December 2017 and July 2018, respectively.68%6&5,%(56	0$5.(76+$5(,1

Our operating expense for 2018 amounted to KRW 15.67 trillion, representing a 1.9 % decrease from KRW 15.98 trillion in 2017.  The de-
crease in operating expense was primarily due to a 8.8% decrease in commissions, a 4.8% decrease in cost of goods sold and a 7. 7% 
decrease in network interconnection expenses, partially offset by a 16.4% increase in labor costs.
The decrease in commissions was attributable mainly to a decrease 
in marketing costs relating to our cellular services primarily caused 
by the continued maturing of the market for new wireless devices 
in 2018, partially offset by an increase in marketing costs relating 
to our ﬁxed-line telecommunication services. The decrease in cost 
of goods sold was primarily due to a decrease in the number of 
wireless devices resold in 2018. The decrease in network intercon-
nection expenses was mainly attributable to decreases in wireless-
to-ﬁxed-line and ﬁxed-line-to-wireless interconnection rates, as well 
as decreases in the number of ﬁxed-line telephone subscribers and 
calling volume.
The increase in labor costs was primarily due to the additional per-
sonnel on payroll in connection with our acquisition of ADT CAPS in 
October 2018, as well as the establishment in June 2017 of our sub-sidiary, Home & Service, which provides in-home customer services 
primarily to our ﬁxed-line telecommunication service subscribers 
that were previously outsourced to a third party vendor and the 
costs for which were classiﬁed as commissions prior to the estab-
lishment of Home & Service, and the expansion of new businesses 
such as AI solutions.

Our ﬁnance income decreased by 30.1% to KRW 256 billion in 2018

As described in notes 3 and 4 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the Group has initially adopted K-IFRS No.1115, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“K-IFRS No. 1115”), from January 1, 2018 and the Group has taken an exemption 
not to restate the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, presented for comparative purposes, in accordance with transition requirements of the standards. The ﬁnancial impacts of adopting 
K-IFRS No. 1115 are discussed in note 3.  The Group’s consolidated revenue is primarily related to the Group’s cellular and ﬁxed-line telecommunications segments.
The Group’s revenue recognition is based on data from complex information technology systems as the Group provides 
a variety of telecommunications services at various rate plans to numerous subscribers which involves high volume of 
transactions with subscribers. In addition, the effect of changes in accounting policies upon the adoption of K-IFRS No. 1115 is signiﬁcant to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Such changes include the changes in the amount of revenue 
recognition related to the allocation of considerations for each performance obligation when the Group provides 
wireless telecommunications services and sells wireless handset to a same subscriber. The determination of stand-
alone selling prices involving complex judgments applied by management. Therefore, we have identiﬁed the accuracy of revenue recognition in the Group’s cellular and ﬁxed-line telecommunications segments as a key audit matter due 
to the complexity of IT systems involved and management judgments involved in the application of the new revenue recognition standard.),1$1&,$/	121),1$1&,$/67$7(0(176 | ),1$1&,$/67$7(0(17

As described in notes 3 and 8 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the Group incurs costs, such as commissions 
to retails stores and authorized dealers based on the number of subscribers retained and newly obtained. Costs that 
would not have been paid if there had been no binding new or renewed contracts with subscribers are capitalized and 
amortized over the estimated service periods. As of December 31, 2018, capitalized costs to obtain contracts amount 
to W2,377,599 million.
Determination of whether certain costs of obtaining a contract could be capitalized as well as the amortization period 
involves a number of key judgments made by the Group and the incremental costs of obtaining contracts are signiﬁcant 
in the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Therefore we have identiﬁed the recognition of incremental costs of 
obtaining contracts as a key audit matter.
The primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter included:
•  Testing certain controls relating to the Group’s process to account for incremental costs of obtaining contracts.
•  Obtaining an understanding of the marketing programs communicated to retail stores and authorized dealers and 
assessing the Group’s determination of whether the costs should be capitalized with reference to the requirements 
of the relevant accounting standards. In addition, on a sample basis, we also compared the capitalized costs with 
payments to retail stores and authorized dealers.
•  Testing the mathematical accuracy of the cumulative effect of initially applying K-IFRS No. 1115 in relation to the 
incremental costs of obtaining contracts as of January 1, 2018 by performing recalculation. 
•  Assessing the estimated service periods that are used in amortizing the capitalized incremental costs of obtaining 
contracts by testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the analysis, and by comparing the data used in estimating the estimated service periods with the Group’s historical subscriber churn rates and publicly available statistical data. 136 137 6.7(/(&20$118$/5(3257 136 137 6.7(/(&20$118$/5(3257OUR BUSINESS OF VALUE CREATION ACCOUNTABILITY FINANCIAL & NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW136 137 6.7(/(&20$118$/5(3257

As described in note 4 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the Group performs impairment test for goodwill at 
least annually by comparing the recoverable amount and the carrying amount of a cash generating unit (“CGU”) to 
which goodwill is allocated. The amount of goodwill that is allocated to the CGUs in cellular and ﬁxed-line segments is 
W1,664,679 million as of December 31, 2018.
In carrying out the impairment assessment of goodwill, management determined the recoverable amount based on the 
value-in-use (“VIU”). Determining the VIU of the above CGUs involves signiﬁcant judgments in estimating the expected 
future cash ﬂows including the estimates of revenue, operating expense, perpetual growth rate, and discount rate 
for each CGU. Considering the signiﬁcant degree of the judgment in estimating the VIU of the cellular and ﬁxed-line 
telecommunication CGUs and the potential impact of the impairment on the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements, 
we identiﬁed the assessment of goodwill impairment as a key audit matter.
The primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter included:
•  Testing certain internal controls over the Group’s process to estimate value-in-use.
•  Engaging our internal valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the key assumptions used to determine the VIU 
for each CGU which included the estimated revenue, operating expenses and perpetual growth rate by comparison 
with the ﬁnancial budgets approved by the management, historical performance and industry reports and in assessing 
the appropriateness of discount rate used by comparison with our expectation based on market data.
•  Performing sensitivity analysis for both the discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied the discounted cash 
ﬂow forecasts to assess the impact of changes in these key assumptions on the conclusion reached in management’s 
impairment assessment.
•  Comparing the cash ﬂow forecasts prepared in prior year with the actual results to assess the Group’s ability to 
accurately forecast.

As described in note 12 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, during 2018, the Group obtained control of Life & 
Security Holdings Co., Ltd. (“LSH”) for W696,665 million in cash. In connection with the acquisition of LSH, the fair 
value of identiﬁable intangible assets recognized amounted to W1,019,503 million.
K-IFRS No. 1103 requires the Group, the acquirer, to recognize the acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, including intangible 
assets not previously recognized, and liabilities assumed at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Determining 
the fair value of the identiﬁable intangible assets requires management’s signiﬁcant judgments in determining the 
valuation methodologies and estimating the expected future cash ﬂows including the estimates of revenue, attrition 
rate, royalty rate, operating expense, perpetual growth rate, and discount rate. Considering the signiﬁcant degree of 
the judgment in measuring the fair value of identiﬁable net assets, we identiﬁed the identiﬁcation of intangible assets 
and measurement of their fair value for intangible assets recognized in the acquisition of LSH as a key audit matter.
The primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter included:
•  Engaging our internal valuation specialists to assist us in assessing the valuation methodologies adopted by the 
Group with reference to industry standards and the requirements of the relevant accounting standards.
•  Engaging our internal valuation specialists to evaluate the discount rate applied by comparison with our expectation

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with Korean Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufﬁcient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal control.
•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.
•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
•  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statemen ts represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•  Obtain sufﬁcient appropriate audit evidence regarding the ﬁnancial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and signiﬁcant audit ﬁndings, including any signiﬁcant deﬁciencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
signiﬁcance in the audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 
and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest beneﬁts of such communication.

Total employment is one of the key indicators that shows a 
company’s job creation such as employment types, genders 
and ages. The total number of employees includes permanent 
and temporary (contract-based) employees who have a direct 
employment contract with SK Telecom, except employees and 
executives of SK Telecom’s afﬁliated companies and subsidiaries. 
Through the efforts to secure human resources with expertise for 
internalization of capabilities and procurement of growth engine 
in advance, the total number of employees increased by 9.57% to 
4,948 as the end of 2018. The ratio of female employees, which is 
a major diversity indicator, increased by 2.6%p from the previous 
year to 16.9% in 2018, and the ratio of female managers stood at 
6.9%. By age, the ratio of employees over 30 years and under 50 
was the highest, and the ratio of permanent employees was 97.7%, 
which was similar to the previous year but was trending upwards. 
SK Telecom grants additional points for job candidates of socially 
disadvantaged groups to expand the employment of minorities, 
and recruits disabled people through separate programs such as 
‘special recruitment program for disabled.’ In 2018, the number of 
the disabled employed by the company remained at 59, similar to 
that of the previous year and the number of veterans employed by 
the company rose to 134. The total number of overseas personnel 
including expatriate employees and local employees stood at 44 
and compared to the total number of employees, the percentage 
of those overseas was low. The percentage of local managers at 
overseas business locations reached 63%, recording a big increase 
from the previous year. 2016 2017 2018

SK Telecom actively implements policies to ease employees’ bur-
dens of childbirth and childcare and support them in this aspect. 
The company set up systems to reduce employees’ workloads and 
prevent disadvantages in their job performance assessment such as 
maternity and parental leaves as well as a shortened working-hour 
system during pregnancy and child-raising periods. The company 
also provides various support programs such as nursing rooms, 
congratulatory allowances for childbirth, scholarships for children, 
the operation of in-house daycare centers, a ﬂexible working hour 
system, and camps for employees’ children. In 2017, the company 
cemented the systematic basis for providing maternity and child-
care support by allowing female employees to work for manda-
tory shortened working hours in their entire pregnancy periods and 
adopting a telecommuting system for pregnant employees to work 
in their homes and a care system for employees’ children who are 
ﬁrst graders at elementary schools. Parental leaves of up to one 
year are available for both male and female employees. If a female 
employee uses a parental leave shortly after a maternity leave, she 
can be provided up to two years for two leaves. 
Thanks to such institutional support, the rate of maternity leaves 
and childcare leaves increased slightly in 2018 despite a low birth 
rate in Korea. In particular, the ratio of male employees’ parental 
leaves stood at 30. 7%, up 7 .8%p from the previous year , show-
ing a steady increase. Moreover, the rate of return after parental 
leaves, which is a key indicator of job security for employees who 
used parental leaves, was 97.4% in 2018, which was similar to the 
previous year.

The number of new employees by age and gender as well as the 
number of turnover employees is calculated based on the number 
of permanent and temporary workers (contract-based) who have a 
direct employment contract with SK Telecom. The number does not 
include employees and ofﬁcers of afﬁliated companies and subsid-
iaries of SK Telecom. In 2018, SK Telecom’s total new recruitment 
rose more than 27% on YoY basis. The increase was ascribed to 
expanding technological human resources for the development of 
core infrastructure in the 5G era including artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), 
data and AR/VR. SK Telecom will continue to recruit new employ-
ees to secure human resources and internalize ICT capabilities. The 
total turnover rate stood at 3.7% in 2018, down 2.6%p from the 
previous year, showing a steady drop. This stemmed from the fact 
that the turnover rate, which showed a temporary increase due 
to the transfer of business subsidiaries/companies invested in by 
SK Telecom, decreased as business hit its stride. SK Telecom con-
tributes to expanding employment and boosting work productivity 
by implementing various welfare systems such as ﬂexible working 
hours, support for childbirth and childcare, sabbatical leaves (Re-
fresh) for long-service employees and dormitories for employees.

SK Telecom focuses on identifying, fostering, and internalizing its 
New ICT expertise in order to build competitiveness in the rapidly 
changing ICT environment and in terms of human resources devel-
opment. Acknowledging the fact that traditional training programs 
have limitations in practically enhancing capabilities, SK Telecom 
has been attempting new methodologies of training while leading 
a sharing/collaboration- and data-oriented culture that offsets de-
cision-making based on information asymmetry from experiences/
intuitions and pursuing the development of commercialization ca-
pabilities based on task implementation. In 2018, SK Telecom fo-
cused on 3 main tasks, as following: 1) securing New ICT expertise, 
2) strengthening commercialization capabilities, and 3) developing 
the ability to understand customer needs based on experiences.
Human resource development for securing specialized ICT expertise 
was carried out by the New ICT Academy and the Data Camp. The 
New ICT Academy focused on training employees on AI, big data, 
IoT, Blockchain, while the Data Camp focused on training on data 
analysis with tools such as R, Python and Excel. Tech Expert Board 
(TEB) members were selected to support the in-house and exter-
nal technology dissemination activities in order to discover and 
manage the ICT technology capabilities which SK Telecom already 
secured. In addition, SK Massive Open Online Courses (SK MOOC) 
which enables employees to learn ICT lectures at world leading 
universities online, and On the Job Degree (OJD) program to which 
employees can acquire overseas degrees in the ﬁeld of data sci-
ence based on online learning. On the other hand, the company 
provided an environment where employees can develop their own 
competencies by using a Digital Learning Portal to share SK Group 
companies’ ICT learning contents. 
Furthermore, we concentrated on expanding New ICT competencies

latest technology as well as developing AI curriculum through coop-

cialize a business model by using the Start @ program while the 
BOBD establishes a new BM development methodology suitable 
for SK Telecom and applies it to current business sites. SK Telecom 
established a more realistic support system such as providing con-
sulting and workshops by external experts and immersion time and 
business funds so that ideas could develop into speciﬁc projects. 
The SKT Innovation Discovery (SID) program where employees plan 
overseas benchmarking on their own to gather information and in-
sight needed for their jobs expanded the base of SK Telecom’s 
commercialization capabilities.In order to create unique customer experiences, our employees 
needed to make changes in their experiences. Therefore, SK Tele-com diffused a culture where members experienced SK Telecom’s products and services ﬁrst and made according improvements.

The implementation of these 3 tasks drove up SK Telecom's total training expense per employee by 37% YoY to 70 hours in 2018. The number of annual training courses shrank 10%p from the previous year to 251 which is seen as a small decline stemmed from attempts to reduce the repetitive enforcement of large-scale collective edu-cation while expanding online education programs.Based on this human capital enhancement momentum, SK Telecom will look for ways to support the establishment of a strong business divisions to become a New ICT synergy company while strengthening its three current tasks in 2019.),1$1&,$/	121),1$1&,$/67$7(0(176 | 121),1$1&,$/67$7(0(17

SK Telecom currently operates a diverse range of programs to im-
prove employees’  health and well-being including creating a pleas-
ant working environment by maintaining suitable temperature, hu-
midity, lighting intensity and noise level in the ofﬁce. The company 
generally supports employees so that they can manage their physi-
cal ﬁtness and mental health by operating an in-house physical 
ﬁtness space called ‘Actium’ and the Health-On program. Further-
more, SK Telecom introduced a ﬂexible time system and a system 
for pregnant women to telecommute. The company is making great 
efforts to ensure employees’ work life balance by providing ma-
ternity and parental leaves and aiding employees in raising their 
children beyond what is legally required. Starting in April 2018, 
we introduced a two-week work shift system called ‘Design Your 
Work & Time (DYWT)’ and Super Friday (the end of work shifts on 
the third Friday of every month at 3:00 pm), to improve employees’ 
work-life balance.
Based on the Health-On Index, a health indicator in 2018, the aver-
age health age decreased from 41 years to 39 years, compared to 
2017. However, the average health score decreased by two points 
from 74 in 2017 to 72. Meanwhile, the company identiﬁed an in-
crease in employees’ obesity rate, imbalance in dietary habits and 
a lack of physical activities as health risks so is planning to make 
improvements through online and ofﬂine health coaching.
The rate of performance evaluation means the number of employ-
ees out of the total number of employees that received evaluations 
according to the pre-deﬁned performance evaluation system. SK 
Telecom conducts performance evaluations on all its employees, 
and recorded 99% of implementation rate of evaluation in 2018. In 
2017, SK Telecom reorganized its performance evaluation manage-
ment system for employees to ensure substantial improvements 
in performances and the enhancement of employees’ capabilities 
based on collaboration. Firstly, the company completely abolished 
the relative evaluation of allocation methods and introduced a non-
rating performance evaluation based on absolute evaluation to 
avoid internal competition. In addition, the company moved away 
from regular/collective performance management concentrated on 
year-end evaluation, and promoted substantial performance im-
provement activities through the individualized annual performance /DERU3UDFWLFHV
SK Telecom actively protects the freedom of association of workers 
under ILO Conventions 87, 98 and domestic labor laws. Employees 
of SK Telecom voluntarily form labor unions by the freedom of as-
sociation, and joined the labor unions according to their choice of 
freedom. As of the end of 2018, the rate of participation in labor 
unions was 90.0%, showing a continuous increase for the past 4 
years. SK Telecom strives to set up a win-win labor-management 
culture and improve working conditions for employees under the 
framework of making healthy relationship between labor union and 
management. 
SK Telecom and the labor union agreed to raise wages 2.5% in 2018 
with the spirit of mutual respect and cooperation, and use a portion 
of the increment in social value creation projects.

SK Telecom conducts an annual survey of its employees to measure 
employee engagement. The survey measures the ‘implementation 
of Voluntarily & Willingly Brain Engagement (VWBE)’, the ‘sense of 
belonging and pride as a member and employees,’ ‘feeling reward-
ing and fulﬁllment’ once a year (at the end of August). The level of 
engagement results from the positive response rate of each ques-
tion in the survey. In 2018, the company struggled to support the 
creation of an environment that can lead to an increase in the level 
of employee engagement due to continuing changes in the internal 
and external environments. However, based on a strong sense of 
purpose to respond to innovation and continuous support for im-
proving employees’ capabilities, employee engagement stood at a 
level similar to that of the past. The Employee Engagement Survey 
was conducted on all employees in 2018. A total of 2,958 employees 
responded to the Employee Engagement Survey in 2018. According 
to the results of the survey, employee engagement stood at 85%; 
86% (2,605 respondents) for male employees and 78% for female 
employees (353 respondents). 5$7(2)3(5)250$1&((9$/8$7,216&21'8&7('

SK Telecom lays the groundwork for providing convenient mobile 
telecommunications services by securing and maintaining the ab-
solute number of subscribers and expanding mobile devices with 
a view to expanding access to its services. At the same time, the 
company promotes digital inclusion for disadvantaged groups in-
cluding low-income individuals and senior citizens. The enhance-
ment of service accessibility can not only have a positive impact 
on SK Telecom’s future revenue by strengthening the subscriber 
base, such as higher customer satisfaction and a lower churn rate 
but from a social standpoint, improve the quality of people’s lives.  
The rate of LTE subscribers and the number of second device sub-
scribers are indicators showing mobile internet access. In 2018, 
the rate of SK Telecom’s LTE subscribers increased 4.6%p year on 
year and stood at 80.3%. In the 2nd device segment, through the 
launches of differentiated products that matched customers’ needs, 
SK Telecom is steadily securing growth engines. In 2018, due to an 
inﬂow of 2nd device subscribers’ handsets, the total number of sec-
ond device subscribers stood to about 742,000, a drop of 274,000 
from a year ago. 
Ever since recognized as a service provider offering the fastest 
LTE service by the Ministry of Science and ICT’s Communications 
Service Quality Evaluation since 2015, SK Telecom is maintaining 
its leading position in network quality by exceeding the average 
LTE speed of domestic telecommunication providers. In 2018, the 
company was honored as the provider of the fastest LTE service 
and received a much higher evaluation score than other companies 
in telecommunication service quality evaluation by the Ministry of 
Science and ICT. In addition, we provide differentiated telecommu-
nications services by providing superior network quality and wider 
coverage compared to competitors through technologies such as 
5 band carrier aggregation (CA) and 4 transmitter and 4 receiver 
(4T4R) utilizing the 2.6GHz frequency band secured in 2016.2016 2017 2018

Furthermore, SK Telecom is constantly expanding its telecommuni-
cations service coverage areas for residents in regions with weak 
service accessibility, such as remote mountainous areas and is-
lands. In 2018, the company has invested in improving the quality 
of voice call in disadvantaged areas to improve the quality of com-
munication services. As a result of communication service quality 
assessment by the Ministry of Science and ICT in 2018, we took ﬁrst 
place in communication quality in rural communities.

Going beyond the leadership in the MNO business area, SK Telecom 
is moving to become a pioneering operator in the New ICT ecosys-
tem on the basis of its network infrastructure. Offering high-quality 
network services is an asset that SK Telecom fundamentally values 
for securing core service competitiveness. To this end, the company 
is making investment in network and is simultaneously pursuing 
consistent quality enhancement as well as technology development 
to provide excellent quality of network service.
In 2018, our annual wireless communication capacity totaled 40.91 
million accounts which tallies to 132% of the total number of sub-
scribers (30.88 million). Annual processed data trafﬁc is on a sharp 
rise with a year-on-year increase of 21.9% in 2018. SK Telecom re-

Network failures can grow into risk against the business continuity 
of individual telecommunications companies, and can lead to a tem-
porary collapse of the economic and social systems if disruptions 
occur persistently. Therefore, it is one of the major tasks of the tele-
communication industry including SK Telecom to ﬂexibly respond 
to increasing data trafﬁc while maintaining a high level of network 
quality and minimizing the service failure rate. In 2018, SK Telecom 
tried to provide stable communication services by expanding ser-
vice bypass automation solutions, devising and implementing mea-
sures to prevent a repeat failure, automatically optimizing network 
quality and applying an abnormal symptom monitoring function.
Despite these efforts, on April 6, 2018, a temporary voice and text 
service failure caused inconveniences for customers, which we pro-
vided compensation for our customers accordingly. In order to pro-
vide better network quality to our customers, we are endeavoring 
to provide safer and more reliable services.

SK Telecom is actively going ahead with mid- to long-term R&D investment that will lead the growth of ICT convergence era including investment in network infrastructure to transform itself into a 5G infrastructure-based ICT synergy company in the opening of 5G era. Investment expenditure in 2018 was KRW 635.5 billion similar to that of the previous year. As a result of the termination of next-generation IT investment, spending on IT (subscriber computing infrastructure) declined, but mid- to long-term R&D investment in AI/media/data are on the uptick and R&D related equity investment is expanding according to NEW ICT investment.Major equity investment cases in 2018 include investment of KRW 65 billion in iRiver (currently Dreamus Company), and the acquisition of IDQ, a Swiss quantum cryptographic communication company for KRW 55.4 billion. R&D human resources have been on a steady rise and the number of R&D personnel in 2018 rose 13.7% year on year to 1,594. This increase was attributable to the expansion of AI-related research personnel, R&D organization personnel including those in the 5G/media/data sectors and human resources for core growth business areas such as AI services, security and mobility. &XVWRPHU6DWLVIDFWLRQDQG&XVWRPHU6DIHW\,QGLFDWRUV
SK Telecom is increasing its customer loyalty from a mid- to long-term perspective through preemptive CEM (Customer Experience Management) aimed at maximizing customer value. In particular, we won ﬁrst place in the industry for the longest period, winning major domestic customer satisfaction surveys (the NCSI, KCSI and KSSQI) in 2018. As a result of the regular CSI evaluation conducted twice a year by SK Telecom, customer satisfaction in 2018 stood at 78 points, maintaining a steady rising trend. 
In 2018, SK Telecom focused on eight customer value innovation 
programs to build long-term customer trust through genuine cus-
tomer value innovation. The company is putting efforts in imple-
menting customer assessments through perspectives of ‘innovation 
of understanding customers’ to comprehend them better, ‘innova-
tion of customer experiences’ based on real changes and ‘innova-
tion of quality’ to offer products/services recognized by custom-
ers as well as operating company-wide working- level councils to 
deliver messages from the customers’ perspective. At the same 
time, it is making efforts to get closer to customers by establishing 
a company-wide working council to identify the current situation, 
ﬁnding out problems and making the newly established organiza-
tion collaborate with related organizations. Through 95 segmented 
tasks based on 53 insights found through the assessment we made 
substantial improvements in business departments and implement-
ed eight major programs for customers. As a result, VoC complaints 
decreased by 10.4% overall, and the amount of related service use 
increased signiﬁcantly, showing favorable responses from custom-
ers, and customers’ positive perception of changes in the company 
improved 17% in the second half, compared to the ﬁrst half in 2018.  
We claimed the top position in the industry with an average score 
of 76.7 in surveys by the three major external customer satisfaction 
surveys.     In addition, as a key customer security index, the small-payments 
VoC occurrence rate which means the number of micro payment VoC 
complaints per annum decreased remarkably every year, reaching

SK Telecom regards customer information protection as a key man-
agement issue in order to cope with the increasing cyber terrorism
and information security issues. The company is striving to identify
and eliminate potential risk factors, strengthening the information
protection system, and reinforcing the inspection of the distribution
network and subsidiaries facts. In 2016, we put in place the Secu-
rity & Quality Management System (SQMS) exclusively for the man-
agement of security for company-wide products and services while 
setting up a website dedicated to blocking information leakage 
which blocks outsiders from having access on customer information 
and ensure that information can be accessed and handled through 
a secured virtual connection website. As a result of our continuous 
efforts to safeguard information, we have not experienced any leak-
age of customer information due to system hacking for eight years 
since 2011. The number of customer information leaks refers to 
that of cases in which SK Telecom’s customer personal information 
management system is hacked and customer personal information 
is leaked to the outside. In 2017, we revised and published SKT 
Customer Information Protection Policy & Guidelines for the ﬁrst 
time in nine years, which can be used as a criterion for making a 
decision on protecting customer information, factoring internal and 
external changes in handling customer information. In addition, Self 
Checklist for Handling Customer Information was revised, speciﬁed 
and factored into deﬁning related personnel’s jobs and tasks.
Since 2015, SK Telecom has conducted a survey on personal infor-
mation protection audits of about 4,500 stores in its marketing and 
solution distribution network. The company has conducted remote 
diagnosis of information leakage related to 15,000 PCs per year. In 
2018, we conducted customer information protection audits on all 
of our distribution channels and conducted 125 (100%) inspections 
of information security in terms of products and services. In addi-
tion, in 2018, SK Telecom guided 11 companies invested in by SK 
Telecom about selective investment measures for security activi-
ties and security systems for protecting core assets based on each 
company’s business characteristics along with overall diagnosis of 
measures on the management of customer information protection.
As a result, we supported invested companies to set up an optimal 
security control that can run on resource owned by each compa-
nies. set up an optimal security control that can run on resources 
owned by each of the companies.
In accordance with the Telecommunications Business Act (Article 83, 
Clause 6) and Protection of Communications Secrets Act (Articles 
13), if a governmental agency requests the submission of data, SK 
Telecom cooperates with it by providing the relevant data according 2016 2017 2018

rights risk on potential breach of subscriber’s rights with continuous 
additional review and in-house due diligence.
In addition, SK Telecom established human rights principles for the 
freedom of expression and against the abuse of technology through 
formalized human rights policies and is doing its utmost to protect user 
rights and human rights by keeping personal information safe. SK Tele -

Since the implementation of mandatory electromagnetic ﬁelds mea-
surement in June 2007 until the present, SK Telecom has been faith-
fully abiding by this regulation. In 2018, a total of 33,964 measure-
ments of electromagnetic ﬁelds by the company at wireless stations 
were carried out. The measurement results showed that the actual 
intensity of electromagnetic waves from the SK Telecom’s wireless 
stations was less than merely one tenth of the standard level for 
human safety. According to the electromagnetic wave rating system 
(introduced in August 2014), nearly all of the wireless stations were 
found at the safest level, level 1 as more than 99.9% of the mea-
sured wireless stations belong to the ﬁrst level. 
Moreover, since August 2014, SK Telecom has supported the ﬁve-year 
research project on electromagnetic ﬁelds’ human impact conducted 
by the Korean Institute of Electromagnetic Engineering and Science. 
As of June 2019, we are carrying out the project for the ﬁfth year and

their business areas and objectives and the proportions of transac-
tions. In November, SK Telecom opened the ‘SK Telecom Win-Win 
Growth Center’ within the Namsan SK site located in Jung-gu to

SK Telecom approaches the investment in local communities from 
the perspective of Creating Shared Value (CSV) that creates innova-
tions in social value by utilizing the company’s capabilities powered 
by its ICT technology and infrastructure. Based on this strategic 
direction, SK Telecom is zeroing in on this issue with creating ICT-
based shared value, providing technology-based platforms for local 
communities, and minimizing the digital divide as top priorities.
Creating ICT-based shared value means activities that support the 
social foundation through the fostering of ICT-based social enter-
prises and startups. Since 2013, SK Telecom has been operating 
diverse programs such as SK Telecom’s ﬂagship ICT Convergence 
venture start-up support project, BRAVO! Restart as well as the 
Youth Fly program supporting college students in terms of entrepre-
neurship/nurturing/overseas expansion, AVS (Agriculture Venture 
Star) which is a program nurturing venture start-ups specialized 
in ICT-based agriculture, and 101 Start-up Korea, a program nurtur-
ing start-ups which is under operation together with SK Planet. In 
2018, we started running True Innovation which integrates these 
programs. We also hosted the Smart Tourism App Development 
Competition, the NUGU Play Development and Idea Competition 
along with the Korea National Tourism Organization. Through these 
activities, SK Telecom contributes to the discovery of new growth 
engines, while at the same time helping to address social problems 
by combining ICT capabilities 
In order to serve communities by creating technology development 
platforms, SK Telecom developed and is running a donation plat-
form called ‘GiveU’ and a community service platform, ‘WithU.’ Ac-
cording to the expansion of a platform-based social contribution 
culture, the total amount of donations through GiveU climbed 16.7% 
compared to the previous year to KRW 350 million. The cumulative

SK Telecom abides by domestic political funding laws that prohibit corporations or organizations from donating political funds. We do not provide political funds, election funds for speciﬁc political groups, and funds to lobby political parties. We are cooperating for the development of public interest by supporting organizations with guaranteed political neutrality. We also recognize that ex-penses associated with policy impacts can be potential risk to the company’s mid- to long-term business perspectives and manage the history and size of donations from a company-wide perspective. In February 2017, the Board of Directors revised rules to enhance the fairness and transparency of the execution of expenses that could affect business policies by strengthening a pre-approval process through the BOD’s decision on a donation of over KRW 1 billion. 

SK Telecom’s GHG emissions are calculated based on the guidelines 
on preparing and managing statements for the Emission Trading 
Scheme (ETS), with data collected from the company’s 28 main 
buildings including data centers. The scope of this calculation in-
cludes emissions from all network facilities (base stations and 
equipment), but does not include emissions from subsidiaries and 
supply chains. Greenhouse gas intensity, on the other hand, is cal-
culated by dividing total greenhouse gas emissions by SK Telecom’s 
parent-only revenues (data coverage). In 2018, SK Telecom’s total 
GHG emissions amounted to 934,664tCO 2e, a 6.3% increase from 
the previous year. Most of SK Telecom’s greenhouse gas emissions 
are generated by network devices due to the nature of the telecom 
industry. This was primarily a result of an increase in power con-
sumption fueled by the establishment of more network equipment. 
To reduce GHG emissions, the company put forth a variety of efforts 
including the integration of network equipment at base stations, 
the replacement of worn-out air conditioners and the adjustment 
of air-conditioning and heating in ofﬁce buildings. However, the 
amount of reduced emissions was dwarfed by the total amount that 
increased, resulting in an overall increase in emissions. 
SK Telecom set a mid- and long-term target to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions by 82.41tCO 2e per KRW 1 billion by 2020. To meet this 
target, SK Telecom will carry out reduction activities such as the 
use of highly energy efﬁcient repeaters and the integrated manage-
ment of base stations. At the same time, by securing carbon off-
sets based on the SK’s proprietary technologies and solutions, SK 
Telecom will actively participate in the Emissions Trading Scheme.SK Telecom is expanding the management scope of indirect GHG 
emissions (Scope 3) through research on social GHG emissions re-
duction and provision of environmental solutions utilizing ICT. Re-
ducing social GHGs refers to reducing the GHG emissions that result 
from the activities of daily life using SK Telecom’s ICT services. 
As part of SK Telecom’s major activities to reduce social GHG emis-
sions, the T map navigation service contributes to pruning fuel use 
and GHG emissions by informing drivers of optimal routes by taking into account distances and real-time road conditions between a 
user’s current location and destination. The volume of social GHGs

GHG emission recorded KRW 130.8 billion and KRW 117.1 billion re-
spectively.

SK Telecom’s energy consumption is managed in compliance with 
guidelines on preparing and managing statements for the Emis-
sions Trading Scheme (ETS), and numerical ﬁgures are aggregated 
by entering billing invoices received from energy suppliers into the 
system. Total energy consumption is calculated by including the 
consumption from all 28 of SK Telecom’s company buildings, data 
centers and network facilities (base stations and equipment), but 
the energy consumption by the company’s subsidiaries and supply 
chain is not included. The intensity of energy consumption is calcu-
lated by dividing total energy consumption by SK Telecom’s parent-
only revenues (data coverage). Regarding energy reduction results 
due to the use of natural air-conditioning and renewable energy 
development, the estimated value of measured data of the previous 
year (2012~2013) has been equally applied to 2018.
SK Telecom has been steadily reducing energy consumption through 
energy saving activities such as reduction of cooling energy con-
sumption through the elimination of heat from major equipment 
and incidental equipment, the integration of network equipment 
such as base stations and repeaters, and the replacement of old 
cooling equipment. In 2018, total energy consumption inﬂated 
6.8% compared to last year due to network equipment that was 
expanded to 19,204TJ. SK Telecom’s energy consumption is mainly 
comprised by indirect energy consumption due to power use, and 
accounts for 99.3% of total energy consumption. As a result, SK 
Telecom is steadily striving to improve energy efﬁciency through 
managing ofﬁce buildings and power generation by new and renew-
able energy facilities, centered by innovation of network structure 
and realizing slimness of network. In addition, we plan to boost 
energy efﬁciency and reduce energy consumption by integrating 
infrastructure equipment after take demand for telecommunications 
services into consideration. Given an increase in energy consump-
tion due to 5G facility investment, SK Telecom plans to limit total 
energy consumption below 28,340TJ by 2020.(*)  The energy consumption standard is based on the methodology guidance from “veriﬁcation prin-
ciples and tasks outlined in the guidelines on the operation of GHG ETS”

Water consumption is estimated based on SK Telecom’s 28 main 
company buildings including data centers, according to invoices for 
water usage, and the calculated total does not include consump-
tion by SK Telecom’s subsidiaries or supply chains. The intensity 
of water consumption is calculated by dividing the total water con-
sumption by SK Telecom’s parent-only revenues (data coverage). 
In 2018, as part of our efforts to reduce water consumption, SK 
Telecom adjusted the drain volume of Seongsu Building’s cooling 
tower and installed water saving valves in toilet bowls and shower 
in the building and changed water for cooling towers on the mo-
bile telephone switching ofﬁce of the building. Thanks to these 
efforts, SK telecom successfully reduced annual water consumption 
to 707,296m3 in 2018, a 0.9% drop from the previous year.:DVWHDQG5HF\FOLQJ
Waste discharge volume is estimated based on SK Telecom’s 28 
main company buildings including data centers, and the calculated 
total does not include the waste discharged by SK Telecom’s sub-
sidiaries or supply chains. The intensity of waste discharge is cal-
culated by dividing total waste discharge volume by SK Telecom’s 
parent-only revenues (data coverage). The total volume of waste 
discharge in 2018 decreased to 1,736 tons, a year-on-year decrease 
of 11.1%, showing a steady decline. Reinforcing the separate collec-
tion of garbage for recycling is keeping the recycling rate at 30% 
or higher.

SK Telecom is bolstering its foundation to let customers participate 
in reducing the use of resources in the process of using SK Telecom 
services by issuing electronic bills and T-Membership Mobile Card 
and retrieving used handsets. The total number of electronic bill 
subscribers includes customers who receive their bills via smart 
phone, email or MMS. SK Telecom’s new electronic bill user rate is 
the percentage of customers who applied for the electronic billing 
service among new subscribers in one year. The use of electronic 
bills prevents the leakage of personal information due to lost bills 
and prevents the unnecessary waste of resources stemming from 
the use of paper bills. SK Telecom’s electronic bill users totaled 
23.45 million at the end of 2018. Since the introduction of the 
electronic bill in 2010, its users have been on a steady rise. The 
new electronic bill user rate also increased slightly to 88.1% year 
on year. 
Since August 2013, SK Telecom has replaced its plastic T-Mem-
bership Card with Mobile T-membership Eco Card. Using Mobile T-
membership Eco Card can reduce about 4.88g plastic per customer 
and about 12g in carbon emission reduction effects. This corre-
sponds to saving four sheets of A4 paper or the breathing volume 
of 40 pine trees. SK Telecom has issued more than 5 million plastic 
membership cards per year in order to operate the T Membership 
program. When they are converted to mobile cards, SK Telecom can 
save about 24 tons of plastic resources per year and slash carbon 
emissions by about 55 tons per year. In 2018, the cumulative T-
membership mobile card issuance rate has increased approximately 
4% from the previous year to 64%, showing a steady increase every 
year. In particular, the T-membership mobile card issuance rate of 
new customers stood at 99% as of 2018. The cumulative customer 
issuance rate is expected to climb, setting off an increase in the 
effects of reducing carbon emissions. 2016 2017 2018

The environmental investment and cost is estimated on SK Tele-
com’s parent-only basis. Environmental costs are expenses incurred 
by SK Telecom for the purpose of reducing environmental impacts 
and improving eco-friendly performances. The company calculates 
and classiﬁes environmental costs into energy conservation and 
climate change response costs, costs for waste and recycling con-
signment treatment, education and training costs, external nature 
conservation costs, and environmental tax and additional charges. 
In addition, SK Telecom implements and tracks green procurement. 
Green procurement costs include costs to buy products and servic-
es with energy consumption efﬁciency grades, high-efﬁciency en-
ergy equipment certiﬁcates, excellent recycling product certiﬁcates, 
environmental marks, environmental grade certiﬁcates, carbon la-
bel marks, low-carbon product certiﬁcates and are not included in 
environmental costs.
In 2018, total environmental costs inﬂated 144.6% year-on-year to 
KRW 1,717 million. SK Telecom is conducting long-term greenhouse 
gas reduction projects in order to secure greenhouse gas emission 
rights in reference to an increase in energy use by new infrastruc-
ture equipment such as 5G equipment. As a result, the main rea-
son for an increase in environmental costs compared to 2017 was 
about KRW 880 million spent on the Myanmar Cook Stove project, a 
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. The CDM is a greenhouse gas reduction system de-
veloped by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change. Investment costs are covered in the form of carbon credits 
with a certain percentage of the carbon emissions reduced based 
on the CDM model. SK Telecom will utilize carbon credits secured 
by CDM project to spread cook stoves in Myanmar to offset an ac-
cumulated shortage in carbon credits during the second plan period 
for GHG emission rights (2018-2020), while consistently securing 
carbon credits in the long term as well.

used FSC⃕ (Forest Stewardship Council⃕ )-certified paper, bearing the logo 
carried only by products made using material from responsibly managed forests and other controlled sources. The report was printed at a FSC-certified print shop using soy oil ink which drastically reduces the emissions of air pollutants.The company also participates in the Carbon Neutral Program run by the Korea Energy Management Corporation to offset greenhouse gas emissions generated from the pulp and energy used to print reports. Despite the company’s varying efforts to reduce environmental impacts, since the process of making and printing in paper generates pollutants, this Report is published both in printand as an PDF ﬁle.SK Telecom plans on reducing resource and energy use through using more PDF ﬁles and the ofﬁcial website of SK Telecom that contain a lot more information than in the print version due to lack of space. We encourage our readers to access this Report as a PDF ﬁle instead of the print edition and visit the ofﬁcial website to save resources and protect the environment, while accessing a lot more information more conveniently.You can download this Report as 
a PDF ﬁle from the ofﬁcial website of SK Telecom(www.sktelecom.com/index_en.html)
