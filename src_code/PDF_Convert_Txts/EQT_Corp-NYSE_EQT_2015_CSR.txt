ABOUT THIS REPORT
TRANSITIONING TO GRI 4.0
The 2014/2015 Corporate Social Responsibility report for EQT Corporation (EQT or 
Company) marks a significant expansion of the Company’s commitment to transparency and 
accountability in its operations. Previous reports followed Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
guidelines 3.1 with the Oil & Gas Sector Supplement (OGSS). This latest report adheres to the 
newer GRI 4.0 standards, including the updated OGSS, which provide a more detailed account 
of performance in categories that are most important to the Company and its stakeholders.  
As with previous publications, EQT used GRI standards and technical protocols to determine 
the materiality of data, methods for reporting data, and validating completeness. 
REPORT BOUNDARIES
This report covers activity from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 at EQT headquarters, 
all locations of the Company’s Production and Midstream business segments, and the 
operations of EQT Midstream Partners, LP (Partnership or EQM), for which EQT was a 
general partner and significant equity owner at year-end 2014. EQT reflects the results of 
the Partnership in its 2014 financial data and in the operational activities of EQT’s Midstream 
business segment. The report does not cover EQT’s foreign subsidiaries, which are either 
inactive or in the process of winding down.
DEFINING MATERIAL ASPECTS
EQT’s primary objective for preparing an annual sustainability report is to identify and 
disclose the information that its stakeholders value, and to help them understand how 
the Company operates as a safe, responsible, and accountable corporate citizen. A 
commitment to transparency ensures that EQT identifies and discloses the information 
that is most important in helping stakeholders assess its performance in several key areas 
of sustainability. By using internal risk assessments, benchmarking, and gap analysis, the 
Company is able to identify which sustainability topics are most material to the business  
and its stakeholders. 
2 Go back to Table of ContentsWhen selecting these aspects for reporting purposes, EQT also considered:
• Scope of all Aspects (as defined here) available for reporting
• Significanc e of EQT’s economic, environmental, and social impacts
• Influence of EQT impacts on s takeholder assessments and decisions
• Relevance of these Aspects and topics in addressing EQT’s impacts
• EQT’s ability to provide complete disclosure responses to these Aspects that enable stakeholders  
to assess EQT’s performance
EQT may also disclose other Aspects and related information in this report not declared as 
material by GRI standards.
IN ACCORDANCE OPTION 
EQT is pleased to announce that its 2015 Corporate Social Responsibility report has been prepared 
in accordance with the criteria defined by GRI 4.0 and the G4.0 OGSS, and that it complies with the 
In Accordance – Comprehensive  option. EQT conducted a self-assessment of the report; however, 
it did not submit the report for external assurance.
EQT’s Corporate Director, Communications is ultimately responsible for compiling, verifying, 
and approving the information contained in this sustainability report, including ensuring that all

Go back to Table of ContentsDear Stakeholders,
Thank you for taking time to read about EQT Corporation’s annual sustainability performance; and thank you to the many 
colleagues who gathered, reviewed, and refined data for our Company’s 2015 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report.  
Using Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, this year’s report is based on the principle of “transparency” and the importance 
of providing honest communications, straightforward and factual education, and interactive outreach opportunities to each of our 
stakeholder audiences. 
This report contains 2014 year-end performance data — and in that same year, EQT participated in a regional energy forum and 
presented a discussion titled “Responsible Operations: Earning Trust Beyond What Is Expected.” Much of that messaging is the 
basis of this 2015 CSR report. You see, for those in the energy industry who have experienced the dramatic change that has  
taken place during the past decade, the lesson quickly learned was that in order to succeed, companies must go above and  
beyond minimum expectations. They need to build trust at all levels so that they can responsibly and prudently tap the energy 
reserves that deliver so many benefits to society. 
As with any industry, the energy sector has a broad range of stakeholders that require engagement. They are located in 
our nation’s capital, in our state capitals, and our local communities. However, the issues at the core of the public dialogue 
surrounding shale gas development remain the same at all levels. And it is up to the industry to continue educating and 
communicating a balanced message of the risks, costs, and benefits associated with natural gas development.
EQT’s CSR report addresses these critical topics of public interest, including safety, environmental stewardship, social 
engagement, and economic benefits. In EQT’s operating regions, we work hard to be good neighbors — our local communities 
expect engagement and they expect transparency. That’s why each of us at EQT is dedicated to maintaining regulatory  
compliance, working toward a zero-injury workplace, preserving and protecting the environment, and giving back to our 
communities. It is also why we prepare reports like this one, to openly share our performance with you — our stakeholders.

5EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT), a Standard & Poor’s 500 investor-owned corporation, is 
headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and operates primarily within the United States 
of America. An integrated energy company with emphasis on Appalachian-area natural gas 
production, gathering, and transmission, EQT began from more humble origins as Equitable 
Gas Company, a member of the diverse family of businesses created in 1888 by inventor and 
entrepreneur George Westinghouse. Today, with more than 125 years of history and experience 
in the natural gas industry, EQT maintains its position as a leader in the use of advanced 
horizontal drilling technology — designed to minimize the potential impact of drilling-related 
activities and reduce the overall environmental footprint. Through safe and responsible 
operations, the Company is committed to sustainability as it helps meet the country’s growing 
demand for clean-burning energy; protects the environment; provides a rewarding workplace; 
and enriches the communities where its stakeholders live and work.
EQT’s produced natural gas sells as a commodity to marketers, utilities, and industrial 
customers located mainly in the Appalachian Basin and the Northeastern United States,  
as well as the Permian Basin of Texas. The Company’s current transportation portfolio also 
enables the Company to reach markets along the Gulf Coast of the United States.COMPANY BACKGROUND
THIS IS EQT
FAST FACTS: EQT Corporation
Type Investor-Owned
NYSE EQT
Founded 1888
Headquarters Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Employees 1,750
Business Segments Production, Midstream
Affiliated Company EQT Midstream Partners, LPAs of December 31, 2014
Go back to Table of ContentsCORPORATE STRUCTURE
At the end of 2014, the EQT workforce totaled 1,750 employees 
working in Pennsylvania (PA), West Virginia (WV), Ohio (OH), 
Kentucky (KY), Virginia (VA), and Texas (TX); and in addition to 
the corporate headquarters, operated through two business 
segments: Production and Midstream.
The Production  segment is one of the largest natural gas 
producers in the Appalachian Basin with 10.7 Tcfe of proved 
natural gas, natural gas liquids, and crude oil reserves across 
approximately 3.4 million gross acres. As of December 31, 2014, 
approximately 630,000 of those gross acres were concentrated 
in the Marcellus Shale play. 
EQT believes it is a technology leader in extended lateral 
horizontal and completion drilling in the Appalachian Basin, 
and continues to improve its operations by using new, innovative 
technology in order to maintain an industry leading cost 
structure to develop its reserves profitably. Proved reserves held 
by EQT increased 29% in 2014, primarily across the Marcellus 
shale play, which contributed approximately 8.7 Tcfe in total 
proved reserves, including Upper Devonian assets.
The Midstream  segment is capitalizing on the rapidly increasing 
need for gathering and transmission infrastructure in the 
Appalachian Basin. In 2012, EQT formed EQT Midstream 
Partners LP (Partnership) to own, operate, acquire, and develop 
midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. The Partnership 
provides midstream services to the Company and other third 
parties through its two primary assets: the Partnership’s 
transmission and storage system and the Partnership’s 
gathering system. Unless otherwise noted, discussions in 
this report regarding the Midstream segment’s business, 
operations, and results include the Partnership’s business, 
operations, and results. 
At the end of 2014, the gathering system included approximately 
8,200 miles of gathering lines, 1,500 miles of which are low-
pressure gathering lines regulated by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC) and owned by the Partnership. 
The Partnership also owned 45 miles of high-pressure gathering 
lines, which are not subject to federal rate regulation. The year-
end 2014 Marcellus gathering capacity was 1,975 MMcf per day.
The transmission and storage system includes approximately 
900 miles of FERC-regulated interstate pipeline that connects 
to five unique interstate pipelines and multiple distribution 
companies. The Partnership, through its affiliate Equitrans, 
LP, owns and operates 700 of these miles, while the remaining 
200 miles, known as the Allegheny Valley Connector (AVC), are 
owned by EQT and operated by the Partnership under a lease 
between the Partnership and EQT.
6The transmission system is supported by 18 natural gas storage 
reservoirs with approximately 660 MMcf per day of peak delivery 
capability and 47 Bcf of certificated working gas capacity. These 
reservoirs are clustered in two strategic geographic areas of 
southwestern PA and northern WV. Of these reservoirs, 14 are 
owned by the Partnership, while the remaining four reservoirs 
are part of the AVC, which is owned by EQT.
GOVERNANCE
ETHICAL CONDUCT  
EQT values integrity and expects all directors, officers, 
employees, suppliers, agents, contractors, and consultants 
working with EQT or EQM to conduct business in an ethical 
manner. Each entity produces a Code of Business Conduct 
and Ethics that is available for review by employees and other 
stakeholders. The EQT Code of Conduct and Business Ethics 
is available on its website (eqt.com) under “Charters and 
Documents” in the “Investors” section. The EQM Code of Conduct 
is available on the Partnership’s website (eqtmidstreampartners.
com) under “EQM Governance” in the “Investors” section.
In addition, EQT’s corresponding policies and procedures provide 
supplementary guidance to, and set expectations for, employees 
involved in EQT and EQM business activities. 
THE CODES OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS  
The Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics reflect the 
commitment of EQT and EQM Boards of Directors, and their 
executive officers, to create and maintain a culture that 
encourages ethical conduct and compliance with the law.
All new employees receive in-person compliance and ethics 
training during their orientation. In addition, new employees 
are required to complete online training regarding the Codes 
of Business Conduct and Ethics and other compliance and 
ethics topics within the first few months of their tenure. Existing 
employees receive Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics 
and other compliance and ethics training on an as-needed 
basis, determined by the business leaders or the compliance 
and ethics department. Ongoing training is provided primarily 
through in-person training. All employees annually certify their 
understanding of and compliance with the Codes of Business 
Conduct and Ethics and related policies. 
The General Counsel and Vice President, External Affairs of EQT is 
ultimately responsible for compliance. EQT periodically conducts 
onsite presentations to review major policy changes, answer 
questions, and remind employees of their individual responsibility 
for compliance. To keep ethics top of mind for everyone, 
employees have multiple resources for asking questions; and a 
quick poll question, derived from the Code of Conduct, is featured 
on the Company’s intranet site at least quarterly.
 
Go back to Table of Contents7THIS IS EQT
The General Counsel also has overall responsibility for the 
mechanisms available to stakeholders seeking advice about 
ethical behavior. All employees and business partners have 
access to the Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics, which 
detail the internal and external mechanisms for seeking 
advice. Current employees may seek advice by contacting their 
supervisor, a member of the Compliance Network (see below), 
or the Compliance Hotline. New employees receive training on 
how to seek advice regarding ethical and lawful behavior during 
their orientation. Requests for advice remain confidential to the 
extent possible.
The Compliance Network is a collection of employees (e.g. 
Corporate Director, Enterprise Risk and Compliance; Corporate 
Director, Internal Audit; Counsel and Corporate Director, 
Employee Relations; Deputy General Counsel, Governance and 
Enterprise Risk; and Deputy General Counsel, Environmental, 
Safety, and Public Policy) responsible for facilitating compliance 
with laws, regulations, and the Codes of Business Conduct and 
Ethics. The Compliance Network is also a resource available to 
answer employee questions. 
The Compliance Hotline offers an anonymous mechanism for 
seeking advice on ethical and lawful behavior. The Compliance 
Hotline, hosted by a nationally recognized independent service 
provider, is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Employees and third parties can also seek advice via the EQT 
or EQM Boards of Directors. Submission forms are available 
on each company’s website. Alternatively, employees and third 
parties may contact the EQT Lead Independent Director or the 
EQM Presiding Director via email at, presidingdirector @eqt.com 
or presidingdirector @eqtmidstreampartners.com, respectively. 
While each company seeks to address every request for advice, 
they do not track the number or the descriptions of those 
requests. They also do not track the level of satisfaction for 
those using the mechanisms for seeking advice, but consider all 
comments when identifying areas for improvement.The majority of vendors receive an annual letter from EQT’s 
Corporate Director, Enterprise Risk and Compliance, notifying 
them of their obligation to comply with the Codes of Business 
Conduct and Ethics, their responsibilities related to conflicts of 
interest, and the channels available to seek advice. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
EQT and EQM each have a Conflicts of Interest policy. The 
Codes of Business Conduct outline the responsibilities of 
every employee to avoid such conflicts, and provides examples 
and references to help identify potential conflicts and obtain 
guidance as needed. EQT’s processes regarding related person 
transactions are set forth on pages 27-29 of the 2015 EQT Proxy 
Statement; there are no compensation committee interlocks 
involving an EQT director.
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
EQT’s Board of Directors (EQT Board) manages the business 
affairs of the Company. The EQT Board has five standing 
committees: Audit; Management Development and 
Compensation; Corporate Governance; Public Policy and 
Corporate Responsibility; and Executive. 
In 2014, the EQT Board held six regular meetings and one 
special meeting. The Committees of the EQT Board met as 
noted on pages 20-21 of the EQT 2015 Proxy Statement.  
At each of these meetings, the committees reviewed the 
economic, environmental, and social impacts, risks, and 
opportunities facing EQT. EQT Board of Directors – 2014

Board) manages and directs the activities of EQM’s general 
partner, which in turn directs the business and affairs of the 
Partnership. The EQM Board has two standing committees: 
Audit and Conflicts.
In 2014, the EQM Board held seven regular meetings. The Audit 
Committee held four meetings, and the Conflicts Committee 
held seven meetings. At each of the aforementioned meetings, 
the committees reviewed the economic, environmental, and 
social impacts, risks, and opportunities facing EQM. 
In addition to general oversight of the business and affairs of 
the applicable entity, the Boards of EQT and EQM also perform 
a number of specific functions, which are set forth in Paragraph 
2 of their respective Corporate Governance Guidelines. The  
EQT and EQM Corporate Governance Guidelines are available 
to the public for review in the “Investors” section of each 
company’s website.
Each board has delegated authority for economic, environmental, 
and social topics to its Chief Executive Officer, who in turn has 
delegated certain of those authorities to members of senior 
management pursuant to established roles and responsibilities. 
These managers report directly to the Chief Executive Officer, 
who in turn reports directly to the applicable Board of Directors. 
EQT does not have governance mechanisms in place for 
specifically managing sustainability risks and opportunities; 
however, the Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility 
Committee of the EQT Board provides oversight for many 
aspects of sustainability risks and opportunities. For additional

COMPETENCIES AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
EQT and EQM are each committed to providing directors with 
an initial orientation to board service. The directors of each 
company routinely receive information to educate them on the 
business of their respective company, including economic, 
environmental, and social topics. Directors of EQT and EQM  
are encouraged to participate in educational programs, for  
which both companies provide reimbursement.
The EQT Board and each of its committees engage in annual 
self-assessments. EQT’s directors assess their individual 
performance in meetings with the EQT Lead Independent 
Director. The EQM Board and Audit Committee also conduct 
an annual self-assessment. The EQT Board and EQM Board 
each take the self-assessment seriously and will take action in 
response to the results thereto, as necessary or desirable.
COMMUNICATING WITH THE BOARD 
When making decisions on behalf of the applicable company, the 
EQT Board and the EQM Board each consider the feedback from 
their respective stakeholders. 
Stakeholders wishing to consult with either Board on 
sustainability issues may contact the Lead Independent Director 
of the EQT Board, or the Presiding Director of the Partnership’s 
board, following the procedures found in the “Investors” 
section of the EQT or EQM websites. These websites are also 
a good source of information about the overarching corporate 
governance practices of both entities, which include charters 
for each of the standing committees of the respective boards. 
EQT and EQM disclose conflicts of interest to stakeholders as 
required by law. 
RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT

TRANSPARENCY AND  
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
Maintaining open and honest communications with its 
stakeholders is essential for companies like EQT to meet the 
demands of the rapidly changing energy landscape. 
With a Company history dating back more than 125 years to 
the early days of using natural gas as an energy source, EQT 
is truly an industry insider with a keen understanding of how 
its business operations affect society, the economy, and the 
environment. The Company also understands how changes in 
stakeholders’ awareness and perceptions of the industry have 
advanced sustainability expectations. 
Pursuing continuous improvement in every aspect of the 
business insures that the Company is always looking for 
better ways to do things. It also helps EQT provide ongoing 
contributions to the development of innovative technologies, 
making its business activities safer and more efficient while 
maintaining a high degree of social and environmental 
responsibility. For this reason, EQT does not establish  
specific targets for sustainability performance — instead the 
Company evaluates issues as part of its overall performance 
management process. 
Go back to Table of Contents10Improving the way it makes stakeholders aware of these 
improvements drives EQT’s commitment to greater 
transparency about its policies, its performance, and its ongoing 
efforts to integrate sustainability into everything the Company 
does. This, in turn, helps those stakeholders reach informed 
decisions, as opposed to assumptions, about the efficacy of 
those actions. EQT works hard to maintain its reputation as 
a Company that values safety, integrity, accountability, and 
transparency; and it knows that these intrinsic ideals are what 
matter most to stakeholders. 
Integrating sustainability into every activity of the Company 
includes giving each employee a personal performance 
objective tied to corporate social responsibility. Every individual 
is empowered to monitor his or her own activities and follow 
established procedures to continuously evaluate operations, 
identify improvement opportunities, ensure compliance,  
and build trust.
WHERE ENERGY MEETS INNOVATION
Creativity, and the ability to execute new, viable, and valuable 
approaches to a business challenge or opportunity, drives 
EQT’s success and longevity in the natural gas industry. 
Using innovative technologies, processes, and practices has 
helped the Company become more efficient and economically 
successful, in turn, helping maximize value to its stakeholders. 
EQT believes its commitment to finding new and better  
ways to do things enhances all facets of its sustainability 
performance, and in 2014, the Company began an initiative to 
start formalizing its innovation aspirations within each of its  
two business segments.
PRODUCTION SEGMENT
In early 2014, the Production business segment began the 
process by taking an intense look at the state of innovation 
across a variety of functional disciplines — identifying the 
enablers of and barriers to innovation, and ultimately designing 
an operational roadmap that would cultivate innovation and  
help the business segment achieve sustainable long-term 
growth and success.
The key components of this new organizational design  
were Governance & Structure, Innovation Process, and  
Portfolio Management. Developing Governance and Structure
The Production business segment created the new position of 
Senior Vice President, Innovation to serve as a focal point for 
driving the necessary change management processes. This 
senior-level position oversees the management processes for 
developing the innovation pipeline and overseeing the portfolio 
of existing innovation initiatives. A new team of specially trained 
innovation coaches, selected from various disciplines across 
the Production business segment, act as mentors, advocates, 
and resources for employees to use as they refine ideas and 
transform them into innovation opportunities for the Company. 
A senior-level innovation governance committee oversees the 
formal evaluation of ideas submitted by employees. 
Defining the Innovation Process
An important part of creating a sustainable approach to innovation 
is the development of a formal process to capture and evaluate 
ideas, recognizing that not all ideas would take the same path.
Existing processes can capture and approve ideas that improve 
institutional knowledge, but to manage the bolder initiatives, 
the Production segment created a four-stage process to ensure 
consistency in the assessment and prioritization of projects from 
idea to launch. The design helps apply rigor when selecting and 
developing bolder ideas by defining: 1) how to articulate the idea; 
2) how to plan and develop solutions; 3) how to test solutions for 
feasibility; and 4) how to prepare best practices and rollout. 
Managing the Idea Portfolio
To maximize return on investments and guarantee alignment 
with the Company’s growth strategy, a centralized process for 
prioritizing and managing innovation opportunities is essential. 
The process created by the Production business segment can 
apply different lenses to assess these opportunities and assure 
that it uses time and resources in the appropriate proportions to 
match the desired innovation portfolio.
Driving Behavioral Change
Innovation training and change management are essential to 
establishing new behaviors and enabling employees to actively 
participate in, and contribute to, innovation efforts across the 
business segment. Innovation leaders and coaches were the  
first to receive specialized training, enabling them to support 
other employees as they joined the innovation initiative.   “What got us here isn’t our future. W e won’t 
throw out what got us here, but it alone won’t 
take us where we need to go.”
   — Steven T . Schlotterbeck
   Executive Vice President and President,   
  Exploration and Production
Go back to Table of Contents11THIS IS EQT
Subsequent training sessions introducing the innovation 
tools and processes are ongoing for the Production segment 
workforce, as well as other EQT employees supporting the 
development and implementation of initiatives.
Next Steps in Production Innovation
The Production segment continues to refine and test its 
innovation strategies and processes while encouraging greater 
cross-functional integration in the creation and development  
of new ideas.
MIDSTREAM SEGMENT
The concept of innovation is not new to the Midstream  
business segment; in fact, it has played a significant role in the 
segment’s business success.  When the Midstream segment 
launched its innovation initiatives for 2014, it took a slightly 
different approach from that of the Production segment.     
For Midstream, the goal was to infuse a culture of innovation 
into all aspects of its daily operations. By pursuing continuous 
improvement through innovation, the segment can ultimately 
achieve its current and planned strategic growth and  
expansion initiatives.Defining the current state of Innovation
During 2014, the Midstream segment assessed the current 
state of its innovative culture by conducting numerous surveys 
of its leaders and employees, and then documenting the broad 
range of themes and topics that fueled creativity. Subsequent 
leadership workshops helped refine the impact of those  
issues, and their potential for guiding future internal and 
external opportunities.  
Although the Midstream segment did not have a formal 
innovation portfolio, the workshops and interviews revealed  
that there were a significant number of projects under way  
or envisioned for the next few years. Encouraged by this 
discovery, the development of a disciplined method for defining 
and creating the right innovation portfolio for Midstream 
became a priority.
Setting the drivers for growth and success
In an increasingly competitive market, becoming fast 
and nimble, managing risk, and effectively executing new 
construction projects are all fundamental to having an 
innovative culture that achieves success for the Midstream 
business segment. Determining what to innovate, creating a 
pipeline of new ideas, and developing a process to transform 
those ideas into business value, facilitates creation of an 
innovation portfolio that reflects the level of risk appropriate  
for the growth objectives of the business segment.
Using the findings from the workshops and interviews, the 
Midstream segment identified several critical elements to define 
its formal innovation process:
•    Types of innovations to pursue
•    Selection criteria and scoring
•    Structured evaluation process
•    Roles and responsibilities to manage the process“W e have some tremendous people who have 
done a lot of great things. W e want to continue 
to leverage their ideas and innovative drive to 
take us to the next level.”
   — Randa ll L. Crawf ord
        Sen ior Vice President and President,   
       M idstream & Commercial
Go back to Table of Contents12While some of the previously identified innovation ideas that 
resulted in improvements to existing structures, processes, 
and products of the business continued on the implementation 
path, others helped test the newly defined innovation processes; 
some continued on to the evaluation state, and others  
were set aside.
Next steps in Midstream Innovation
The Midstream segment joins its counterparts in Production 
in refining and testing their respective innovation strategies. 
Innovative ideas can come from anywhere, and anyone. During 
2015, the segment is expanding its communication and training 
efforts for all Midstream employees so they can effectively 
understand and feel empowered to participate in the innovation 
process. That includes developing innovation facilitators; 
establishing and documenting metrics; and creating an 
information portal that allows employees to see what ideas are 
already in the pipeline, and submit new approaches to achieving 
Midstream’s business objectives.
INNOVATION – 2015 AND BEYOND
Finding innovative ways to operate the business enhances 
EQT’s sustainability efforts. The Company’s ability to adapt new 
technologies and processes better prepares EQT to weather 
economic downturns and maintain consistent, long-term 
growth for the Company while maintaining safe operations 
in all aspects of its work. Creating and fostering a strong 
culture of innovation also enables EQT to take advantage of its 
numerous growth opportunities and address the challenges 
that lie ahead for the natural gas industry. 
With that in mind, the Company announced a new Innovation 
leadership competency in 2015. As part of their formal 
performance evaluation, all EQT employees will receive an 
assessment of their participation in the creation and execution 
of new, viable, and valuable approaches to a business 
challenge or opportunity.

WORKPLACE SAFETY
Occupational health and safety is more than a material aspect to EQT; it is a core value of 
the Company. EQT conducts its business in accordance with applicable health and safety 
requirements established for companies operating within the United States, and EQT strives 
for continuous improvement. There is nothing more important than making sure every worker 
returns home safely at the end of each day. EQT’s business leadership, supported by its health 
and safety program which is managed by a team reporting directly to the Deputy General 
Counsel, Environmental, Safety, and Public Policy, is responsible for integrating proper safety 
and health practices into all of the Company’s operations. 
Safety and health professionals perform hazard identification of EQT’s work activities and 
engage with management and workers to implement safe work practices, controls, and training 
to minimize risk. All EQT workers, regardless of title or work responsibilities, have stop-work 
authority in the face of unsafe working conditions; EQT will not compromise safety to gain a 
business advantage. To ensure ongoing health and safety compliance, EQT uses a combination 
of internal and third-party safety inspections and audits. EQT’s annual health and safety 
performance objectives are established individually within each of the business segments.
During November 2014, EQT conducted an all-employee safety survey administered through the 
U.S. National Safety Council (NSC) to obtain a better understanding of what EQT is doing well 
and where the Company may have opportunities to improve its safety culture. EQT employees’ 
rating of the Company’s safety culture, and of its commitment to safety, scored in the top 10%  
of the 820 companies within the NSC database. Results were shared with employees, and  
cross-functional teams were formed in 2015 to address improvement opportunities.
Safety training and performance monitoring are essential elements of EQT’s workplace safety 
program. Employees receive ongoing training, and are encouraged to share these learned 
safety behaviors with family and friends. The frequency, type, and delivery method of safety 
training varies, based on the work performed and the types of issues faced every day. EQT has 
no unionized employees and therefore, has no formal labor agreements that may define specific 
health and safety training topics.
Go back to Table of ContentsGo back to Table of Contents14EQT also does not have formal, joint management-worker 
safety committees; however, within the Midstream business segment a similar worker-management process was established. The Field Safety Technician program helps employees take greater ownership of their personal safety, providing leadership expertise to others, and enabling employees to identify and prevent situations that could cause harm to themselves or those around them. For example, Field Safety Technician employees complete a 10-hour training certification program by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), along with specialized safety training. This training helps to identify additional ways to minimize safety risk, build employee safety knowledge, and assist with compliance verification activities.
All employees have a safety-related performance metric that 
directly affects their annual compensation. For employees in the Production and Midstream business segments this includes a “Zero Incidents” performance goal, which is a IndicatorsPerformance Rate

EQT records the nature of each incident, including minor 
injuries, using the OSHA injury/illness recordkeeping guidelines. OSHA does not require, nor does EQT track region or gender details. The most frequent injury type for EQT employees relates to working outdoors, such as insect bites and poisonous plant exposure, as well as slip/trip/fall incidents. The Company does not use independent contractors or supervised workers as defined by GRI, so it does not, itself, record and track safety statistics for these types of individuals. However, as part of EQT’s contractor safety pre-qualification process, the Company does review this information for  vendors at its job sites.Month Topics

CONTRACTOR SAFETY
The natural gas industry requires a wide variety of highly 
specialized vendors to perform its field operations, and these 
contractors often work simultaneously with EQT employees 
and other vendors. To maintain EQT’s high level of diligence 
regarding workplace safety, the Company requires every 
organization performing work at one of its facilities to maintain 
the same high standards that it imposes on itself. EQT also 
requires all contractors involved in its field activities to be 
prequalified through ISNetWorld® — a recognized third-
party platform for monitoring safety performance — before 
beginning work on any EQT field worksite. Each contractor, 
and its subcontractors, must also adhere to all applicable 
regulatory health and safety requirements, and follow EQT’s 
Safe Work Rules for contractors.
The ISNetworld® qualification process allows EQT to evaluate  
a potential vendor in a number of key safety areas including:
• Safety Management Systems
• Injury and Illness St atistics
• Fatality History
• Department of Tr ansportation (DOT) Inspection 
Compliance
• DOT Motor Carrier Safety Rating
• Written Safety Programs and Safety Training
• Experience Modific ation Rating (EMR) 
New and existing suppliers that expect to perform contract 
services in the areas of drilling, construction, maintenance, 
and operations must meet EQT’s safety requirements to 
qualify, or continue to qualify, to perform services for the 
Company. Once they pass the prequalification process, each 
contractor must also agree to adhere to EQT’s Contractor 
Safety Standard and the Safe Work Rules. The rules and 
standards apply to all work performed by the employees of  
the contractor, as well as those of their subcontractors  
and agents.
PIPELINE SAFETY
Natural gas is a safe and reliable form of energy. When used 
properly, natural gas pipelines are the safest way to transport 
energy; however, as with any type of transportation of 
potentially hazardous products, a high level of care is required. 
EQT regularly inspects the right-of-way over its pipelines for 
potential hazards, including leaks and items that may block 
access to the pipeline. The company places pipeline markers 
in areas where underground pipelines are located, especially 
where the pipes intersect with streets, railroads, bodies of 
water, and high traffic areas. 
Above grade facilities such as valves, compressor stations,  
and storage fields are an important part of a transmission 
system; EQT provides security to these facilities by using 
electronic monitoring, fences, buildings, locks, and periodic 
surveillance. In accordance with federal regulations, 
EQT operates an integrity management program for its 
transmission pipelines that:
• Identifies high-consequenc e areas along the transmission 
lines based on population and land or building use
• Creates a risk model that prioritizes the high-
consequence areas for integrity management
• Completes specific evaluations, such as corrosion 
investigations and pressure testing, to assure the  
integrity of the pipelines
EQT strives to operate its transmission system safely and 
has programs in place to help those who live or work near 
its lines stay safe. Each year, the Company mails a pipeline 
safety brochure to residents and businesses located near its 
pipelines, providing information on what to do, and not do, in 
various situations such as suspicious activity or vandalism 
near a facility, potential pipeline leaks, or excavating on or 
near a pipeline location. EQT also promotes the national  
“811 – Call Before You Dig” program that emphasizes the 
importance of knowing where underground utility lines are 
located before excavation work begins — helping to keep 
neighborhoods and communities safe.
Go back to Table of Contents16COMMUNITY SAFETY
Maintaining the safety of its workforce, contractors, and 
equipment is important, but creating a safe environment for 
local communities near EQT operations is also a priority. 
EQT employees routinely meet with local emergency services 
personnel, public works employees, and other public officials 
to share vital information about ways to improve the joint 
response to safety-related incidents in the field. These 
meetings help expand local awareness of what happens at a 
jobsite, the type of equipment involved, and most appropriate 
response for various incident scenarios. The goal is to help 
local first responders be more comfortable with EQT’s 
operations; establish who to contact in various situations;  
and understand what they can expect from EQT if an  
incident occurs.EQT also works closely with local municipalities to address 
public concerns about increased truck traffic near the 
Company’s job sites. For many of these sites, the only 
access is via local roads shared by the residents, public 
transportation, and school buses. In 2013, EQT implemented 
a program designed to curtail truck traffic along school bus 
routes. Preliminary construction routes to EQT site locations 
are carefully considered to take into account locations of 
schools, recreation areas, and other public points of interest. 
A route design’s primary considerations are based on safety, 
and as a result, sometime necessitate a longer route. Once 
construction and operations-related traffic commences, EQT 
uses third-party monitoring by private security agents with law 
enforcement backgrounds. These agents have radar-equipped 
vehicles, and authorization to pull over EQT-related traffic.
Working with local governments and school districts, EQT 
places signs along active truck routes notifying its drivers, 
and those of its contractors, that travel is prohibited during 
posted hours when school buses are picking up/dropping 
off students. An added community benefit of the program 
is that it also alerts other drivers that they need to slow 
down and watch for children when traveling these marked 
routes. EQT also develops and distributes to employees and 
contractors a Traffic Control Plan that contains EQT-imposed 
speed limits, curfews, and route restrictions. EQT actively 
monitors compliance of these elements and promptly takes 
the necessary steps to address reported violations by its 
employees or by those contracted to perform work on the 
Company’s jobsites. EQT requires contractors to implement 
GPS-based systems on their vehicles to monitor vehicle  
speed and location; this often provides useful data for 
contractor accountability.
 “Saf ety is more than a material aspect to EQT; 
it is a core value of the Company.

SUSTAINABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY
When it comes to being a good corporate citizen, sustainability and transparency work hand in 
hand at EQT. Many of the Company’s employees and families live in or near the communities 
where they work, so their demands for safe and responsible operations are just as strong 
as other stakeholder groups interested in protecting local environmental resources. EQT 
respects its stakeholders’ expectations. The Company has built a long-standing reputation as a 
responsible operator by integrating sustainability into the many phases of its development and 
operating processes. 
EQT’s commitment to protecting natural resources is what makes environmental compliance, 
emissions, effluents and waste, and water issues material aspects to the Company and its 
stakeholders. These topics are also important because federal, state, and local laws in the 
United States that govern these aspects could affect EQT’s ability to construct or operate 
natural gas exploration, production, gathering, and transmission facilities. EQT’s management 
approach to these aspects includes actively working to maintain compliance with respect to 
the environmental laws and regulations of the United States, as well as those of the state and 
local governments where field activities are located. Failure to comply with these laws and 
regulations could result in regulatory actions against the Company and financial losses. 
EQT’s business operations are subject to an internal Environmental, Health, and Safety policy 
providing principles, guidelines, and expectations for its employees and contractors. The policy 
states that:  i) EQT has a steadfast commitment to the protection of the environment; ii) EQT 
will conduct its business operations in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner 
at all times; and iii) EQT will strive to preserve and protect the land, air, and water where 
its employees live and do business. The policy also directs EQT’s businesses to operate in 
accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Marcellus Operations Guiding Principles
Flammable 
AtmospheresNatural gas encountered during the drilling 
process is vented away from the work 
area. During completions and flowback, 
flammable zones are established in areas 
where natural gas will be vented. Natural 
gas liquids produced during flowback are 
stored in flammable zones during flowback 
and removed after flowback.
High 
Pressure 
SystemsAll equipment and components used in 
pressurized systems are appropriately 
rated and capable of operating under the 
maximum rated pressure. High pressure 
pumps and equipment are only used when 
necessary and appropriate for the task, and 
are routinely tested for integrity.
Pit Design & 
OperationPrior to construction, potential pit locations 
are evaluated to establish suitability. Pits are 
engineered and designed to be stable and 
impervious, and are inspected to establish 
that they are constructed as designed. 
Inspections are conducted regularly to 
evaluate pit integrity.
Well Control EQT maintains a minimum of two barriers 
at all times between the open producing 
formation and the atmosphere. A responsible 
person with a well-control certification from 
an accredited training program is on-site 
during drilling and completions. Blowout 
preventers are tested prior to being placed 
into service, and remote actuators are 
maintained away from the rig and not tied to 
the rig hydraulic system.
Well 
Design & 
ConstructionWells are designed to protect fresh 
groundwater and prevent methane 
migration. Surface casing is installed and 
the void outside of the casing is filled with 
cement. If cement circulation to the surface 
is not possible for the surface casing, EQT 
installs baskets at appropriate depths and 
then grouts the annulus to the surface to 
create a barrier between subsurface zones.Numerous internal activities ensure proper management  
of the material aspects related to environmental  
stewardship, including:
• The Environment al, Health, and Safety (EH&S) department 
and business leaders periodically review this aspect with 
EQT’s Board of Directors, and review it on a quarterly  
basis with the Board’s Public Policy and Corporate 
Responsibility Committee 
• A team of senior executives conducts quarterly reviews of 
environmental and safety performance of the business units
• All EQT emplo yees are subject to annual accountabilities 
tied to compensation that include social responsibility, 
safety, and environmental performance
• EQT maintains tr aining programs for all operations 
employees on these material aspects
• Business unit l eaders conduct periodic safety and environ-
mental performance reviews with all operations personnel
• In 2015, EQT is est ablishing a multi-disciplinary process 
to better anticipate social responsibility, safety, and 
environmental aspects of its operations; and to further 
consider the stakeholders in its operations planning
The Company monitors the effectiveness of its approach 
to mitigate environmental issues by evaluating existing 
and new regulations, routinely inspecting its facilities, and 
conducting annual third party auditing of its facilities to ensure 
material compliance with these issues. When the results 
of the evaluations suggest the need for adjustment to its 
management approach, EQT takes appropriate steps to  
address the issues. 
EQT goes to great lengths to protect water, air, and land 
throughout its operating regions. The Company employs spill 
prevention planning; it measures and assesses its emissions 
and continually looks for new technologies and processes for 
reducing those emissions; and it works with property owners  
to restore the land to its original condition after operations  
are complete. 
A few of EQT’s precautionary measures include:
• Mitigating potential methane emis sions that include, for 
example, operating “low bleed” and “no bleed” pneumatic 
valves; utilizing reduced emissions completions; instituting 
rigorous directed inspection and maintenance procedures; 
and reducing compressor “blowdown” emissions by often 
recycling gas to gathering and transmission pipes
• Reducing NOx and particulate matt er emissions by  
substituting natural gas for diesel in drilling rig and fracturing 
engines, and working with engine suppliers to upgrade 
emissions controls in EQT’s contractor engine fleets 
• Converting from diesel to natural gas fuel in EQT’s  
vehicle fleet• Monitoring ground water and surface water that is close 
to EQT’s drilling sites to ensure no effects have occurred
• Implementing area-of-review procedures when siting well 
pads, to account for both surface and subsurface risks at 
each site

SAFEGUARDING NATURAL  
RESOURCES – WATER  
Fresh water is a vital component of EQT’s natural gas drilling 
program, and it is equally as important to the Company’s 
stakeholders. EQT maintains a strong commitment to using 
this critical resource responsibly, and regularly measures and 
monitors its use to ensure that the Company’s activity has no 
significant effect on nearby water sources.
WATER WITHDRAWALS
EQT relies on three primary sources of fresh water for its 
natural gas production operations: surface water, municipal 
water, and groundwater. In all cases, the Company strictly 
adheres to applicable state-regulated water withdrawal 
procedures, including pass-by flow regulations, to determine 
water withdrawal thresholds necessary to maintain ecosystem 
health and human well-being. EQT also uses available online 
water withdrawal tools, monitors existing stream gauges set 
up by the U.S. Geological Survey, and sets up and monitors 
its own stream gauges to ensure that the Company is fully 
complying with established regulations.
The largest source of freshwater that EQT withdraws each 
year comes from surface water; however, the amount is highly 
dependent upon location, timing, season of the year, and 
number of completions operations taking place. EQT withdrew 
significantly more surface water in 2014 than in 2013, primarily 
from a combination of completing more wells (163 versus 139, 
respectively) and using more water for each well  (204,771 bbls/well versus 171,228 bbls/well, respectively) due  
to longer laterals. Surface withdrawals were made in PA, OH,  
and WV (EQT did not withdraw any surface water for its TX, KY,  
or VA operations). 
The second largest source of freshwater used by EQT in 2014 
came from municipal water or other water utilities. EQT 
increased the amount withdrawn by 17% in 2014 compared 
to 2013. Again, this is largely due to increased operations in 
southwest PA (specifically Greene, Washington, and Allegheny 
Counties) where municipal water supplies are accessible and 
often represent the primary low-cost water source. During 2014, 
EQT made municipal water withdrawals in PA, OH, and WV.
Although it remains a relatively small percentage of overall 
withdrawals, the amount of groundwater withdrawn in 2014 
increased compared to previous years. This is primarily because 
EQT established operations in West Texas during 2014, an area 
where groundwater supplies essentially all of the freshwater 
required for well completion. The entire volume of groundwater 
reported for 2014 came from 11 separate groundwater supply 
wells (one in PA, two in WV, and eight in TX). 
Wastewater represented a new, but very small percentage of 
overall withdrawals in 2014. This is primarily due to initiatives to 
accept impaired water from recycling plants and directly from 
other natural gas producers that were willing to pay for the costs 
associated with transporting the water. Wastewater withdrawals 
took place in PA, OH, and WV. 
During 2014, EQT did not use rainwater as a primary source; 
however, the Company maintains a number of water storage 
facilities and pits in its operations and those facilities and 
pits passively collect rainwater, which is subsequently used 
in Company operations. EQT has not historically attempted 
to quantify this collected rainwater due to the inherent 
significant uncertainties and assumptions that would render the 
quantification inexact.
The surface water volumes reported by EQT come from an 
internal Bill of Lading (BOL) tracking system that documents 
the type of withdrawal, the source, the location, and the amount. 
When withdrawing water from a source, the transfer company 
(when pumping water directly to a pit) or the trucking company 
(when hauling the water from the source) must report the type of 
withdrawal (surface water, municipal water, or wastewater) on 
the BOLs they provide to EQT.
EQT internally tracks the amount of groundwater withdrawn 
during the year from each of the groundwater supply wells used by 
the Company. In general, water transfer contractors operating the 
groundwater wells track the volumes pumped using totalizing flow 
meters and report these totals to EQT on a daily basis. A portion of 
this information resides in the BOL tracking system, and in these 
cases, the trucking companies report withdrawals on BOLs when 
hauling the water directly from the source.Go back to Table of Contents21ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
Quarterly water reporting to regulatory agencies in PA, OH, 
WV, and TX demonstrates that there were no instances 
where the amount of freshwater withdrawn from any source 
significantly affected a water source, or exceeded any average 
daily or maximum daily withdrawal limits during 2014.
SUSTAINABLE WATER USAGE
As part of its continuous improvement efforts, EQT routinely 
collects nearly 90% of the water that flows back from the 
completion of wells. That water is then reused to produce new 
wells at the same well pad or at other sites.

• EQT freshwater withdrawals did no t signific antly affect water sources of any type, including those in designated protected areas or those having  
biodiversity value
• EQT believes that no water sources having value/importance to local communities wer e signific antly affected by EQT fresh water withdrawals,  
nor were any people or their livelihoods affected due to dependence on water resources
The Company works to continually increase the amount of 
wastewater it recycles from flowback water, filtered drilling 
water, and produced water, however, freshwater withdrawals 
have also increased, resulting in a recycled-to-withdrawn rate 
that is slightly lower than 2013.
In 2014, EQT reused 6.6 million barrels of flowback water, 
drill pit liquids, and production fluids from its Marcellus and 
Utica drilling operations. When water is no longer suitable 
for recycling or production purposes, EQT sends that water to 
state and federally permitted underground injection facilities 
for safe disposal.

• All produced water is either injected or reused; EQT does not discharge any produced water to surface water, however EQ T does flo w water back 
to permitted, lined, aboveground impoundments 
• Because there is no discharge, no report standards for produced water quality are required or reported, nor, accordingly, does EQT measure the 
volume of hydrocarbon discharge in produced water
KEEPING DRINKING WATER SAFE
The natural gas production processes begin at the ground 
surface and extend underground, perhaps miles below the 
surface. Some stakeholders are naturally curious about how 
companies like EQT minimize the potential for impact of gas 
extraction processes on drinking water. Most fresh potable 
groundwater exists within the upper few hundred feet of the 
ground surface. Below these depths, groundwater becomes 
increasingly brackish (salty) and possibly un-potable. The 
Company takes great care to protect freshwater resources, 
and has developed procedures to make sure the water near  
its operations is not affected or altered, and remains safe to 
drink and use.
The process begins by defining a water quality baseline. 
This involves a field survey, sampling, and analysis of 
nearby groundwater sources before starting any operational 
activities, including drilling. EQT documents and reviews 
any pre-existing conditions to ensure that planning activities 
for the site consider the adjustments necessary to protect 
groundwater. In some cases, EQT may re-sample to document 
the water source quality after completion of the well.
All of EQT’s drilling practices include the use of multiple  
layers to isolate freshwater sources from the drilling process, 
and from deeper brackish water zones. This results in the 
use of at least three layers of steel and cement, known as 
triple casing, that ensures that nothing used to drill the well 
or stimulate the flow of natural gas can migrate into the 
freshwater aquifers.WHAT IS HYDRAULIC FRACTURING?
Freshwater aquifers, the source for drinking water in many 
rural locations, are usually within a few hundred feet of the 
earth’s surface. Hydraulic fracturing, on the other hand, 
occurs several thousand feet and often more than a mile below 
ground, which is far beneath any freshwater zone. Therefore, 
the potential risks posed to groundwater resources tend to 
lie in surface operations rather than the hydraulic fracturing 
process itself. 
EQT conducts hydraulic fracturing in accordance with state 
regulations using water recycled from previously fractured 
wells or obtained from freshwater sources. This water is then 
mixed with sand and a small percentage of chemical additives. 
The fracturing fluid is injected under controlled high pressure 
into triple-cased wells that are designed and tested to prevent 
any effect on groundwater. The pressure causes the targeted 
rock formation to break open and expand, and the sand 
particles hold these fractures open, allowing natural gas to 
flow up the pipe to the wellhead. 
EQT is committed to operational transparency. In fact, the 
Company was one of the first natural gas producers in 
Appalachia to disclose voluntarily the actual content of the 
hydraulic fracturing fluid used at each of its well sites. To 
support that commitment, EQT became a charter participant 
on FracFocus, an independent educational website created by 
the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and 
Gas Compact Commission. 
This website (fracfocus.org) provides information to help 
stakeholders understand the ratio of water and additives being 
used for natural gas development in their communities.  
Go back to Table of Contents23ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
The Company’s disclosures on FracFocus identify the general 
mixture amounts of the fluid, and explain the specific use of 
each chemical additive. The PA Department of Environmental 
Protection has stated its intention to establish its own 
reporting system and cease use of FracFocus in the future.  
In the meantime, however, EQT will continue to use FracFocus 
for its reporting. 
The hydraulic fracturing fluids EQT currently uses in its 
Marcellus operations do not contain additives with diesel 
carriers, and the Company has significantly reduced the 
amount of other chemicals used during hydraulic fracturing:
• Traditional biocides have been replaced with a variety of 
environmentally friendly, non-chemical alternatives
• Acid utilization has been reduc ed by approximately 50%
• Improved friction-reducing products have allowed the 
quantity of this chemical used to be significantly reduced
MANAGING AND PREVENTING SPILLS
Spill prevention is another top priority at EQT. The Company 
maintains spill plans, or Spill Prevention, Control, and 
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, for worksites that store fluids, 
in order to minimize the chance for a release and to dictate 
actions required should a spill occur. The plans also guide the 
implementation of training programs, inspection protocols, 
and secondary containment monitoring and repair programs 
for all of the Company’s natural gas wells and compressor 
stations. The Company conducts monthly inspections of its 
facilities and tracks the data electronically to enable repairs. 
The typical emergency response and spill preparedness 
program includes the following steps:
• Determine the source and type of spill and take  
corrective action
• Evacuate any employees requiring medical attention
• Isolate the area
• Stop the spill as soon as possible using available methods
• Contain the spill with the use of available resources, 
including Spill Kits (complete with absorbent booms, 
pads, pillows, and personal protective equipment), 
containment ditches, and diking. EQT does not use 
chemical dispersants
• Notify the immediate supervisor or Ar ea Manager of  
all spills
• Notify the Environment al Coordinator of all spills and 
complete an environmental incident investigation form
• Perform or observe proper clean-up measures as 
directed by the Environmental CoordinatorIf a spill does occur, EQT uses appropriate and effective 
cleanup measures that quickly achieve remediation of the spill, 
including any affected soil. The methods used are effective and 
release no dispersants to the environment. Coupled with the 
removal and disposal of the cleanup materials according to 
prevailing federal, state, and/or local regulatory requirements 
in effect at the time of the spill, these cleanup measures result 
in minimal environmental or community impacts. 
At EQT, a significant spill is considered as one requiring 
notification to state or federal officials. In 2014, EQT 
experienced 46 reportable spills, with a total volume of a  
356.89 barrels (bbls). Of these spills, four contained petroleum 
totaling 139 bbls, and 14 were non-petroleum totaling  
114.07 bbls; none of the petroleum or non-petroleum spills 
originated from third-party contractors. 
There were no requirements to disclose any of these spills in 
the Company’s 2014 Form 10-K or any other required financial 
statements. For all of the reported spills, EQT’s utilization of 
appropriate and effective cleanup measures resulted in the 
absorption and/or removal of the spill, so there were minimal 
impacts to the environment and local community.
EQT’s standard procedure is to follow every incident with 
an evaluation of the cause of the spill so it can identify and 
implement corrective action. To prevent recurrences, the 
Company shares these new techniques and protocols with its 
field employees and contractors, and integrates them into its 
design standards and operations.EQT goes to great lengths to protect water, air, 
and land throughout its operating regions.
SAFEGUARDING NATURAL  
RESOURCES – AIR
MANAGING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
EQT monitors and reports on specific types of air emissions  
that are relevant to its business operations and/or required 
by state or federal regulations, but there are no applicable 
regulations limiting emissions of greenhouse gases on a 
country or regional basis, nor are there any industry specific 
regulations. Because EQT pursues continuous improvement 
in all of its business activities, the Company does not establish 
specific goals or targets for its management of greenhouse gases.
EQT’s gross direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas emissions for 2014 
were 884,976 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions. This 
calculation includes CO2, CH4, and N2O; there were no biogenic 
CO2 emissions. The Company does not maintain records of 
equity basis emissions, nor does it track indirect greenhouse gas 
emissions from outside the Company (Scope 2 or Scope 3).

reducing EPA reportable GHG emissions within its two primary 
business segments. It seeks continuous improvement in 
identified areas that provide the most opportunities for GHG

MANAGING WASTE AND  
PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY
EQT employs environmentally responsible, cost-effective 
methods to dispose of its produced waste. The Company 
reuses (or sells as a usable product) materials such as 
flowback fluid and condensate, wherever possible. Other 
materials are disposed of at permitted injection wells, landfill 
facilities, and treatment facilities.
PERMITTED WATER DISCHARGES 
EQT limits the ecological impact of its operations by managing 
the treatment and discharge of the non-recyclable water 
produced by its drilling operations. Nearly all of the 2014 
discharges took place in the Company’s KY and VA operations. 
In Kentucky, EQT discharged 349.04 m3/year of used 
water that was treated to meet discharge standards of the 
Kentucky Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. The 
process pretreats the water with an oil skimmer then runs 
it through an activated carbon filtration system. A third party 
contractor samples the pretreated water monthly and tests it 
in EPA certified labs using appropriate EPA methodology as 
prescribed by permit conditions. EQT reports the test results 
monthly via netDMR, and logs volumes discharged on the 
day of sampling. EQT did not reuse any of this water. NetDMR 
is a web-based application that allows National Pollutant 
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permittee Users to 
enter and electronically submit Discharge Monitoring Report 
(DMR) data to the EPA.
In Virginia, EQT discharged 994.8 m3/year of used water at 
a permitted sanitary sewer system at an EQT warehouse/
office location; the Company did not reuse any of the water. 
Here, the water goes through a filtration system and then is 
disinfected using UV light prior to discharge into a local creek. 
A third party contractor maintains the treatment system and 
services it monthly. Filters are monitored using differential 
pressure to indicate change out requirements, and the UV light system has built-in redundancy to ensure disinfection of 
all discharge water. Components prone to wear are replaced 
according to a prescribed maintenance schedule or sooner, as 
needed. During 2014, EQT updated the preventive maintenance 
program to include evaluation of the collection system, and 
subsequent improvements to ensure treatment of all water 
prior to leaving the site.

DRILLING WASTE
EQT’s drilling operations also produce solid waste, including 
drill mud and cuttings. This material is processed using solids 
control equipment that efficiently separates the drilling fluids 
from the solids. Drying agents then remove any residual 
moisture, and the dried cuttings are containerized and trucked 
to landfills that are pre-approved to accept these solids in 
their permitted disposal cells. EQT continues to improve the 
efficiency of its solids management program by using higher 
efficiency systems that create better separation of drilling fluid 
and drill cuttings, reducing the overall weight of the disposed 
product.  Using more effective drying agents decreases the 
amount of these agents needed, which also decreases the 
weight of the disposed product. 
MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF WASTE DISPOSAL
When choosing disposal methods, EQT seeks to achieve 
a balance between the available disposal options and the 
potential environmental impacts of each option, coordinating 
the most efficient, economically responsible and cost-effective 
disposal methods possible. When practical, the priority is 
to reuse or recycle, but landfills, deep well injection, and

approved treatment facilities are other options appropriate 
for the Company’s operations. EQT complies with regulatory 
agencies de minimis thresholds for waste reporting as 
applicable. EQT believes that its permitted discharges have not 
significantly affected any water body.
KEEPING PROTECTED AREAS SAFE 
EQT holds leases that contain wetland areas, Army Corp 
of Engineers property, national forests, and state forests; 
however, the Company follows all of the federal, state, and 
local regulations and guidelines within these areas for its 
operations in KY, OH, PA, VA, and WV. EQT actively tries to 
avoid drilling inside protected areas — in 2014, EQT did not 
drill any wells within any of the sensitive areas listed above — 
however, it sometimes has operations that are located nearby. 
Experienced in the use of horizontal drilling technology, the 
Company is able to drill multiple wells from a single pad, thus 
minimizing the impact on the environment. In most cases, 
this technology enables EQT to drill directionally to extract gas 
from these sensitive areas without affecting the surface.Active Acreage Leased or Owned in

When it conducts extraction activities within areas of high 
biodiversity value outside protected areas, EQT follows all 
federal, state, and local regulations to ensure protection of 
existing species. As an example, EQT takes precautions to 
protect the Indiana bat and several species of freshwater 
mussels found in some streams in the Company’s operating 
area. Within these known areas, EQT conducts studies to 
identify if these species exist in potential drill sites. If they 
do, the Company’s first goal is avoidance and if that is not 
possible, EQT works with the appropriate agencies to develop 
and execute protection plans.Waste Disposal Methods – 2014
Go back to Table of Contents27ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
For operating areas in Pennsylvania, EQT utilizes the 
Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventory Environmental 
Review Tool (PNDI ER Tool). This online database enables 
EQT to perform a search for potential impacts to threatened, 
endangered, special concern species and special concern 
resources in Pennsylvania. The PNDI ER Tool is a function of 
the Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program (PNHP), which is 
a partnership between the Department of Conservation and 
Natural Resources, the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, 
the Pennsylvania Game Commission, and the Pennsylvania 
Fish and Boat Commission. 
If the PNDI ER Tool indicates that a project has the potential 
to affect a particular species, further agency coordination is 
required. Agency coordination can result in a habitat survey, 
avoidance measures, and/or mitigation measures such as 
those in southwestern PA that EQT has implemented: 
• Northern Myotis (My otis septentrionalis)
• Torrey’s Rush (Juncus torreyi)
• Harbinger-of-Spring (Erigenia bulbosa)
• Four-angled spike-rush (Eleocharis quadrangulata)
EQT uses similar practices in its KY, OH, VA, and WV  
operating areas.
REDUCING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT
EQT recognizes that the choice of direct energy sources can 
significantly influence the Company’s environmental footprint, 
so energy consumption is another area where EQT works hard 
to reduce its impact on the environment. 
GREEN COMPLETIONS
During the initial days of a new well’s productive life, it also 
produces associated water, sand, chemicals, and drilling 
debris, otherwise known as flowback. In the past, producers 
collected the fluid and solids in a pit and flared or vented the 
initial flow of gas into the atmosphere to allow the impurities 
in the flowback to clear before connecting the well to the 
pipeline system. Alternatively, green completions techniques now enable EQT 
to capture the initial gas emitted during the well-completion 
process instead of releasing it to the atmosphere. Doing so 
successfully limits the amount of flared and vented gas at the 
Company’s well sites. In 2014, nearly 100% of completed EQT 
wells utilized “green completions,” as defined by the EPA. 
Discrete site or operational characteristics caused the few 
instances where the Company did not use green completions. 
With a green completion, the pipeline network extends to 
the well site before well completion begins so it is ready to 
receive any gas produced immediately. During this process, 
the flowback mixture is routed through a separator to collect 
the solid materials, which later go to an approved landfill. 
The remaining water, containing the chemicals and mineral 
constituents, is stored for reuse in subsequent fracturing 
operations. The natural gas, which was traditionally flared or 
vented, is directed into the pipeline and transported to market, 
drastically reducing methane emissions. 
During 2014, the volume of flared gas during well completions 
was 101,735 mcf, while the amount of vented gas during well 
completions was 0 mcf. In relation to the volume of natural gas 
produced in the year, the total volume of flared and vented gas 
was only 0.000038 million-barrel oil equivalent (mboe).
USING NATURAL GAS AS AN ALTERNATE FIELD FUEL
In mid-2012, EQT began exploring the use of natural gas-
powered drill rigs and completion equipment at its well sites. 
The design of these drill rigs makes them cleaner and quieter 
to operate than conventional diesel-powered equipment. 
Although more costly to build, the natural gas rigs can be less 
expensive to operate. The major benefit to the environment is 
that rigs running on natural gas emit 20% to 30% less carbon 
dioxide compared to their diesel counterparts, and have a 
small fraction of the emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur 
oxides, and particulates. 
EQT field-tested two different options for displacing diesel 
fuel in production activities. One used a drilling rig powered by 
liquefied natural gas (LNG); the other a rig converted to use 
“field gas,” which is unprocessed gas that comes directly from 
a nearby well. This latter method taps into gathering pipelines 
that carry gas from on-site production. In addition to reducing 
emissions, powering rigs with field gas eliminates the noise 
and truck traffic associated with deliveries of diesel fuel used 
to power traditional rig equipment. Thanks to the success 
of the initial pilot operations, EQT now regularly uses rigs 
powered by field gas whenever they are available and the site 
plan can accommodate them. In 2014, the Company used four 
of these rigs, and added three more in 2015.  
Go back to Table of ContentsGo back to Table of Contents28FACILITIES
Efficient energy use at EQT’s facilities affects occupant  
health and safety, the environment, and the Company’s 
finances, all of which make it a material aspect to EQT  
and its stakeholders.
To manage its energy use, EQT conducts yearly monitoring of 
progress and effectiveness of executed facility improvements, 
including benchmarking EQT buildings against other facilities, 
and removing the environment (degree-days) from the 
analysis, allowing EQT to identify the buildings with higher 
energy use and concentrate on these locations.
Natural gas is EQT’s primary direct energy source for 
conditioning building spaces for occupancy (heating oil is only 
used in locations where gas is not readily available).  
The Company also uses a significant amount of electricity 
for heating/cooling, lighting, and various support equipment. 
Because EQT leases many of its facilities, particularly  
office space, choosing a specific energy source is not  
always possible. 
The Company’s overall square footage for its building facilities 
increased during 2014, and the heating degree-days metric 
increased, which resulted in a 7.8% increase in direct energy 
use. To compensate, the Company implemented an extensive 
preventative maintenance program for all of its facilities. 
Using benchmarking against similar buildings, EQT identified 
opportunities for improvement, ensuring that all facilities  
run efficiently. 
As an example, when maintenance or renovations take 
place, the Company upgrades lighting fixtures; installs 
motion sensors; uses night and weekend setbacks to control 
temperature during low occupancy; and upgrades equipment 
to take advantage of energy efficiencies. During 2014, EQT 
continued to refine timed usage of utilities, including facility 
thermostat settings to avoid heating or cooling unoccupied 
spaces. At corporate headquarters, the Company benefited 
when the building owner installed new HVAC equipment  
and controls. 
EQT also set a baseline for the energy star ratings of office 
equipment used at Company locations, and pushes for even 
higher ratings when purchasing or leasing new equipment. 
During 2015, EQT plans to make longer-term investments at 
its owned facilities, including boiler replacements and lighting 
upgrades. EQT will continue tracking energy use with the 
intent to develop improvements based on return-  
on-investment analysis.FLEET VEHICLES
Another area where EQT is actively working to minimize 
its environmental impact is by using natural gas in its fleet 
vehicles as a cleaner-burning alternative to carbon-rich fuels 
such as gasoline and diesel. The EQT fleet management 
function dedicates substantial effort to increasing the number 
of vehicles that use compressed natural gas (CNG), which 
reduces the organization’s overall emissions.
EQT reports and analyzes CNG usage monthly. The Company’s 
fleet management team shares the data, including individual 
driver usage, with leadership in each business segment to 
foster awareness and encourage greater use of CNG vehicles 
for field operations. As a result, in 2014 EQT’s CNG usage in 
bi-fuel vehicles increased year-over-year by 167%.
In response to demand from fleet owners and individual users, 
the Company added pump capacity at its public access CNG 
fueling station built in Pittsburgh, PA. EQT actively supports 
initiatives to expand the infrastructure needed to promote 
greater use of CNG as a transportation fuel in all states where 
EQT has business operations. In addition, EQT renewed its 
cash incentive program to help interested employees purchase 
CNG vehicles for personal use.
As CNG fueling stations become more prevalent across PA  
and WV, the Company continues the conversion of its fleet 
to run on CNG. Although EQT’s total energy consumption 
by vehicles increased by almost 4% in 2014, additional CO2 
emissions were avoided, due in part to the use of CNG instead 
of diesel or gasoline.
The Midstream segment of EQT uses GPS Insights on its fleet 
vehicles to help minimize drive time and miles driven. These 
GPS systems, operated in conjunction with EQT’s internal 
work management systems, determine efficient routing 
and planning of work. To encourage compliance, midstream 
operations personnel have compensation plan objectives that 
focus on reducing drive time and mileage. 
FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES AND OTHER BENEFITS
EQT employees have multiple opportunities to help reduce 
the Company’s GHG emissions. For those based in traditional 
office environments, flexible work schedules reduce the 
number of days employees commute in a given week; tax 
incentives are provided where available to encourage greater 
use of public transportation; and all facilities are equipped 
to use web-based meeting services and conference calls, 
reducing the need for travel.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
EQT understands that its business activities directly affect the lives, and livelihoods, of its 
stakeholders. The Company values transparency in communications, and appreciates that its 
license to operate depends on providing information to diverse groups of stakeholders, enabling 
them to understand and evaluate how the business operates.
WHO ARE EQT’S STAKEHOLDERS?
EQT continually monitors internal and external interest in its business, as well as the broader 
natural gas industry, and uses that information to identify key stakeholder groups. The Company 
implements appropriate communications methods for each party to hear, understand, and be 
informed. The specific interests and methods of interaction are as diverse as the individual 
parties are, but based on recurring contact, EQT has identified several key stakeholder groups:
• Investors
• Employees
• Communities near operations
• Landowners/Royalty Owners
• Elected Officials
• Regulators
• Non-Gov ernment Organizations (NGOs)
• Nonprofit organizations and charities
• Suppliers
• News Media/Industry Analysts

MAINTAINING OUR SOCIAL LICENSE TO OPERATE – 
COMMUNITY OUTREACH
Unlike typical industrial or commercial operations that can 
often be located where it is most convenient for all parties 
involved, the extraction and transport of natural gas must occur 
where the resource is located, often in or near communities. 
As EQT’s business operations expand, the Company has also 
increased its efforts to enhance communications and personal 
interactions with nearby residents and businesses. 
EQT’S Community Advisors play an important role in maintaining 
the connection between EQT and its neighbors. As EQT 
employees, the Community Advisors are based regionally in or 
near EQT’s primary operating areas. This regional approach 
helps them to cultivate relationships with local elected officials, 
first responders, and other external stakeholders as they 
work to protect and maintain EQT’s corporate reputation. As 
members of their respective communities, the Community 
Advisors are a regular touchpoint for gathering information to help EQT identify local concerns before they inconvenience 
neighbors. They act as a conduit for suggesting ways to 
strengthen Company processes and procedures as they 
advocate for the community by ensuring that identified issues 
reach the appropriate levels in the Company and ultimately 
achieve resolution. The Community Advisors also become 
the central point of contact for residents to learn more about 
current or future projects in their communities, minimizing 
concerns about the what, when, where, and why of EQT activity 
happening in their community.
The issues tracking system implemented by the Community 
Advisor program in 2013 continues to refine its documentation 
and resolution processes, and provides major input to the 
continuous improvement activity at EQT. The internally managed 
database helps identify common concerns and appropriate 
solutions so the Company can anticipate and resolve issues 
before they occur at similar operations in the future. Stakeholder Inquiries and Response Methods – 2014
Go back to Table of Contents32Capturing all aspects of a given concern, from identification to resolution and lessons learned, not only helps avoid recurrences, 
but it also provides another way to report community issues upward within the Company. During 2014, some of the most common

Although the Community Advisors are the most visible means 
of interacting with local communities, the Company has other 
internal approaches to organizing and tracking responses to 
specific types of issues raised in its operating communities. 
The land administration department in the Production business 
segment handles royalty complaints and certain change-of-
lease ownership questions, while its land department manages 
leasing questions and landowner concerns about drilling and 
associated activities. The land department in the Midstream 
business segment manages questions and landowner concerns 
about pipeline construction, pipeline safety, and compressor 
station operations. In its EH&S department, EQT has a freshwater source 
protection, monitoring, and internal reporting program. This 
program enables the Company to assess and understand pre-
existing groundwater conditions; monitor conditions during 
drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations; and quickly respond 
to any discovered water issues or landowner complaints. 
The program also tracks analytical data, complaints, complaint 
status, and updates on whether the issues potentially relate 
to EQT’s activities. The number of complaints received per 100 
wells spud provides a benchmark value for ongoing quarterly 
comparisons. Senior management in the Production business 
segment, and EQT’s Executive Environmental Council, receive 
periodic reports from this program.Resolving Community Concerns – 2014
Go back to Table of Contents33SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
EQT’s ongoing strategy to manage its relationships with  
local communities effectively is one of the reasons that  
the Company did not encounter any significant disputes  
(i.e., disputes that could halt or disrupt current, planned,  
or proposed operations) during 2014. 
Successful decommissioning of sites is another effective 
strategy. EQT bases decommissioning decisions on the 
economic viability of the site. No EQT sites that were active in 
2014 had decommissioning plans in place, and there were no 
complaints on outstanding local community issues nor any 
government notices on decommissioning during the year.
EQT does not explicitly track the total land area of active and 
inactive sites; however, during 2014, the Midstream business 
segment had 120 active compressor stations, four inactive 
compressor stations, and eight active dehydration stations. 
The Production business segment had approximately 11,961 
active wells, and 79 plugged wells. EQT also transferred 
approximately 2,900 active wells, four injection wells, and 19 
active compressor stations to Range Resources.
As a reference, EQT defines inactive sites as non-operating 
compressor stations (midstream operations) and shut-in  
wells that are closed-off and do not produce natural gas 
(production operations). 
INVESTING IN OUR COMMUNITIES 
EQT works hard to integrate social responsibility into the many 
facets of its business activities, which includes investing in the 
communities directly affected by its operations. 
All of EQT’s employees live and work within the United States, 
and the Company strives to hire from within its operating 
regions when the required skill sets are available. The local 
effort also extends to EQT’s supply chain, and includes helping 
smaller local companies partner with primary vendors to gain 
valuable industry experience.

EQT also invests millions of dollars every year to help improve 
local roads and infrastructure in numerous counties where the 
Company has active operations. 
In 2014, EQT and the EQT Foundation invested more than  
$5.1 million in charitable giving to local communities. The EQT 
Foundation, a separate 501(c)(3) organization, awarded more 
than $4 million of that total to support local programming in 
Education, Arts and Culture, Environment and Community — 
areas of mutual importance to EQT and its stakeholders living 
and working near the Company’s operations.
EQT Corporation contributed an additional $1 million in 
local giving in 2014, including slightly more than $500,000 to 
support Pennsylvania’s Educational Improvement Tax Credit 
program, and approximately $112,000 to sponsor numerous 
county fairs and festivals across its multi-state footprint.  
EQT’s other corporate donations provided much needed 
support to local community events, fire departments, food 
banks, playgrounds, parks, schools, and libraries. 
Donations and sponsorships made from corporate treasury 
dollars are in relatively small amounts, however, to ensure 
that EQT’s charitable activities (financial and in-kind) do not 
support illegal purposes, a business case for any donation or 
sponsorship proposed by a department or business unit must 
be presented to and approved by management. The Company 
does not provide donations or sponsorships to individuals, nor 
does it provide donations or sponsorships to local authorities 
with decision-making responsibilities regarding EQT’s current 
or future operations. 
The EQT Foundation’s Executive Operating Committee reviews 
funding proposals from nonprofit organizations and makes 
recommendations to the Foundation’s Board of Directors  
for approval. The Foundation’s funding priorities are available 
at eqt.com in the “Our Communities” section of the website.
Go back to Table of Contents34ENGAGING IN RESPONSIBLE  
PUBLIC POLICY INVOLVEMENT
As lawmakers continue to discuss and debate policies 
governing natural gas development, EQT recognizes the vital 
importance of engagement on these public policy discussions 
to protect its interests and create value for its shareholders. 
The Company actively participates in the political process, 
including supporting candidates whose views align with the 
Company’s business interests.
EQT has developed policies to manage its interaction with 
elected officials and regulatory agencies to ensure that it 
remains compliant with all federal, state, and local laws. 
No employee may engage in lobbying activities on behalf of 
the Company, or use corporate treasury dollars for political 
purposes, without permission from EQT’s Corporate Director 
of Government Affairs or the General Counsel. 
PUBLIC POLICY OVERSIGHT
The EQT Board of Directors’ Public Policy and Corporate 
Responsibility Committee (PPCR) provides additional 
oversight of EQT’s public policy involvement and strategies. 
The committee reviews and provides input and direction to 
management and the Board about the Company’s approach 
to governmental affairs. More information about the PPCR 
committee is available on the EQT website at ir.eqt.com/
charters-and-documents.
EQT conducts its political and public policy activity in 
compliance with local, state, and federal laws. The PPRC 
annually reviews all contributions made to political candidates 
and discusses the public policy issues that affect the company.
SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES
EQT supports federal, state, and local policies that promote 
stable investment climates for the exploration, production, and 
transportation of natural gas. These include policies governing 
environmental protection; taxes; natural gas production and 
transportation; and expanding the use of natural gas in the 
transportation, manufacturing, and electricity generation 
sectors. Some important legislative issues of importance to 
EQT include the Pennsylvania severance tax, lease integration, 
intangible drilling costs, and energy infrastructure:
Pennsylvania Severance Tax  – Governor Tom Wolf has 
proposed a natural gas severance tax for unconventional 
wells. EQT is working with the Governor’s Office and the 
General Assembly to ensure that any severance tax proposals 
establish reasonable rates and maintain the key provisions of the 
Marcellus Shale Impact Fee that distributes revenues to local 
communities where Marcellus Shale drilling is taking place. Lease Integration  – EQT supports legislation in West Virginia 
that allows operators to jointly develop multiple oil and gas 
leases owned and controlled by the same producer. Lease 
integration legislation gives producers the ability to jointly 
develop adjacent oil and gas leases at one time through 
horizontal drilling. It is essential to have legal mechanisms 
available, similar to those available in other major gas 
producing states, that will allow for the full development 
of natural gas resources — based upon a standardized 
set of policies that are fair to both producers’ and lessors’ 
interests. Lease integration legislation maximizes natural gas 
development while minimizing the surface impact associated 
with natural gas well development. Lease integration 
also ensures that all lessors are able to benefit from the 
development of their resources.
Intangible Drilling Costs  – Federal tax law allows natural 
gas producers to deduct the costs associated with drilling 
for natural gas and oil that have no salvage value. These 
“intangible” drilling costs represent a significant portion of a 
producer’s capital budget and eliminating this provision from 
the Federal tax code will reduce the amount of capital that is 
available for drilling new wells. 
Federal Energy Infrastructure Legislation  – The U.S. 
Congress is considering several bills that relate to the 
permitting and safe operations of interstate pipelines. EQT 
is monitoring these bills to ensure that any changes to the 
current pipeline regulatory programs are reasonable and 
establish a fair and predictable regulatory environment. 
CORPORATE ENGAGEMENT
EQT’s political engagement takes on many forms. Upon the 
approval of Company management, EQT may use corporate 
treasury dollars to pay membership dues for business and 
industry trade associations. These organizations support 
member companies by educating the public, advocating for 
the interests of its member companies and industry, fostering 
critical relationships, and supporting informed public policy 
decisions. Business and industry trade associations may 
allocate a portion of their membership dues to lobbying 
activities. In 2014, EQT maintained memberships in a number 
of business and industry trade associations.  In total, EQT 
spent $935,367 in dues for these memberships, which were 
intended to support the regular programs and operations of 
each association. Although the associations reported that 
$161,814 of those dues was spent on lobbying activity, EQT  
did not direct payments to any of these associations for 
political purposes.

In addition to routine memberships, EQT provides in-kind 
support to business and industry trade associations to enhance their advocacy, educational outreach, scientific research, and public awareness efforts. EQT employees are active participants in the governance of the organizations to which the Company belongs, often serving as chair of key committees or subcommittees. Depending upon the structure of the association, these chair positions may serve as part of the association’s governance body.
As active participants on association committees and  
related programs or projects, EQT employees speak at industry conferences and conventions, address the public  and/or media, and represent the industry in testimony before government or other regulatory bodies. 
EQT views all of these memberships as strategic components 
of its efforts to engage stakeholders, develop and implement best practices, and encourage financial, social, and environmental sustainability by members of the industry.
Go back to Table of Contents36POLITICAL SPENDING
EQT and its employees provide financial and in-kind 
contributions to political parties, politicians, and related 
institutions through the EQT Pennsylvania State Political 
Action Committee (PAC), the EQT Federal PAC and with EQT 
corporate treasury dollars. The primary funding source for 
the EQT Pennsylvania State PAC is through transfers from the 
EQT Federal PAC. These contributions comply with the laws 
and regulations of each jurisdiction of the Company’s business 
operations, including all U.S. federal and state campaign 
finance laws. For more information about how EQT selects 
candidates to support, visit the “Our Responsibilities” section 
of eqt.com.
EQT Treasury Dollars
During 2014, political spending using EQT corporate treasury 
dollars totaled $178,700. Of that total, $38,700 represented 
contributions to candidates for, and members of, the Virginia 
Legislature. The Virginia Public Access Project disclosed these 
contributions on their website at vpap.org.
Remaining contributions from EQT treasury dollars totaled 
$140,000 to organizations organized under Section 527 of 
the Internal Revenue Code. These contributions supported 
memberships to the Democratic Governors Association, the 
Republican Governors Association, the Republican State 
Leadership Committee, and the Democratic Legislative 
Campaign Committee. During 2014, EQT did not make any 
contributions, or payments of corporate treasury dollars, to 
Super PACs, ballot measure committees, or 501(c)(4) social 
welfare organizations for political reasons.
Employee Political Engagement
Total domestic political spending from the two EQT PACs  
during 2014 was $146,000. The EQT PAC board, which is 
comprised of EQT senior leaders, reviewed and approved 
all PAC disbursements. In addition to transfers to the EQT 
Pennsylvania State PAC to fund contributions in PA, these 
disbursements included:
• Contributions to c andidates for and members of the 
Pennsylvania General Assembly and candidates for 
governor: $66,750
• Contributions to c andidates for and members of the West 
Virginia Legislature and candidate for governor: $22,200
• Contributions to c andidates for Pennsylvania County and 
City Offices: $5,350
• Contributions to c andidates for Kentucky County and City 
Offices: $2,250 
• Contributions to c andidates for and members of the 
Kentucky Legislature: $10,450
• Contributions to c andidates for U.S. Congress and U.S. 
Senate: $39,000ATTRACTING AND RETAINING  
THE BEST EMPLOYEES
One of EQT’s most important stakeholder groups is the skilled 
workforce that is critical to the Company’s continued success 
— and with continued growth, it must be able to attract and 
retain the talent required for its operations.
EQT’s recruitment and retention effectiveness relies heavily  
on its industry reputation and its rich history in the regions 
where it operates. The basis for EQT’s employment brand 
is the trust earned as a good corporate citizen, the growth 
opportunities available to its employees, and its compensation 
and benefits programs. 
EQT continuously reviews and evaluates its hiring, 
employment, and compensation practices to ensure that 
they comply with applicable law and are competitive with the 
external labor market. In addition, evaluation of the Company’s 
approach comes in the form of: feedback from exit interviews, 
feedback from internal Employee Resource Groups (ERG), 
the results of employee surveys conducted by third-parties, 
turnover rate, ongoing internal evaluations of its compensation 
practices, and diversity representation in its workforce. EQT 
routinely reviews and evaluates information obtained from 
these sources and, when deemed appropriate by management, 
develops a plan to address the areas of concern.
DEMOGRAPHICS
As of December 31, 2014, EQT had 1,750 employees, all 
located within the United States, and all classified as either 
full-time or part-time. Of these employees, 91 self-identified 
as minority. EQT does not have any employees covered by 
collective bargaining agreements.

BENEFITS
EQT designed its core benefit package to meet the personal and professional needs and expectations of employees and their families. There is no difference in the benefits provided to EQT employees based on work location or operational business units, however the available benefits do vary based on work status (full-time vs. part-time) as indicated in the chart on page 39. 
Supplementing the benefit package is EQT’s “Take Charge” 
wellness program, that offers personal health coaching, wellness information, and health management programs to help employees DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIONEQT believes that leveraging the skills and perspectives 
of a diverse workforce challenges the status quo and  spurs innovation, which leads to growth and increased Company performance.
Diversity and Inclusion is part of EQT’s Corporate Social 
Responsibility Value Driver, in which performance is reviewed annually to ensure that EQT:
• Is recruiting the best and brightest talent from all
communities
• Recognizes that employee differences bring richness to
the work environment
• Maintains a work environment that makes objective
decisions, is inclusive of, and fosters diverse views
and perspectives
EQT evaluates its approach to employee diversity by  routinely reviewing feedback from exit interviews, feedback from employee resource groups, the results of employee engagement surveys, turnover analysis, ongoing internal evaluations of the Company’s compensation practices and diversity representation in the workforce. When deemed appropriate by management, the Company develops appropriate plans to address the areas of concern.Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)EQT sponsors several ERGs, which are groups formed by employees based on shared characteristics or life experiences. Introduced in 2013, the development of ERGs at EQT  supports the Company’s efforts to attract, retain, and develop diverse talent; and aids in promoting EQT’s efforts in the communities where it does business. EQT currently has  four established ERGs: 
• Multi-Ethnic ERG
• Parents Resource Group
• Women in Energy
• Developing Professionals

individual results (or information from any part of the Program) 
remain strictly confidential. The Take Charge program includes 
employee educational sessions facilitated by professional 
medical staff and scheduled during work hours, as well as 
newsletters mailed to employees’ homes for the benefit of  
their families.
EQT’s Employee Assistance Program compliments Take Charge 
by providing confidential short-term counseling services 
and treatment programs; as well as referrals for issues 
such as family and relationship concerns, elder care, money 
management, and legal problems. All employees, including 
EQT Employee Benefits – 2014those who waive the Company’s medical coverage, have access 
to this benefit — and anyone living in the employee’s household 
is eligible. The Company pays the full cost for up to five in-
person visits with a counselor for each problem.
In 2014, EQT continued its on-site health-screening program 
for all employees. The employee receives immediate results 
from the screening, along with a consultation with a medical 
professional to review and ask questions. The Company also 
provides cash incentives to employees that participate in online 
or telephone-based health coaching programs, smoking 
cessation programs, and pregnancy education offered through 
contracted third parties.
TRAINING 
Training and education is critical to EQT’s ability to attract, 
motivate, and retain talent and to facilitate a culture of 
continuous employee development and innovation. Ongoing 
employee training and education also ensures up-to-date 
technical skills in critical positions, however, EQT does not 
currently have a mechanism for accurately tracking the training 
that each employee completed during the reporting period.
On the first day of employment, every EQT employee completes 
new hire orientation. This program ensures that each employee 
understands the Company’s leadership competencies, performance expectations, and culture. Keeping EQT’s 
employees well trained provides formal and informal growth 
opportunities throughout their careers, and fosters a culture  
of process improvement and innovation. 
Managers/supervisors routinely work with their employees to 
identify programs and course work that would improve their 
skill sets. Other career development tools employed by EQT 
include cross-functional rotational assignments, individual 
development plans and coaching, and in-house operational/
technical training. EQT’s training effectiveness is measured 
through employee performance and promotions.
Go back to Table of Contents40For full-time employees interested in continuing their formal 
education, EQT offers an Education Assistance Program. 
There is no maximum benefit under the Program, provided the 
employee receives necessary course approvals in advance and 
obtains the required grade levels. 
Skills management is not limited to an employee’s active work 
life. The Company works with employees nearing retirement 
to ensure a smooth transition at the end of employment. 
During 2014, EQT’s 401(k) Plan Administrator conducted 
in-person sessions, online courses, one-on-one meetings 
in local offices, and telephone discussions for those seeking 
advice about retirement planning. 
The EQT Employee Assistance Program, managed by 
an independent provider, is another resource that offers 
online courses and individual counseling sessions for those 
employees retiring or terminating from the Company. In 
addition, EQT offers a separation package to most employees 
who terminate involuntarily.
INTEGRITY AND ETHICAL CONDUCT
Integrity is an essential component of EQT’s core values — and 
ensuring that all representatives of the Company understand 
the expectations and requirements defined by the Company 
is critical to growth and success. EQT’s General Counsel and 
Vice President, External Affairs has overall responsibility for 
managing anti-corruption and anti-competitive efforts. 
To communicate these requirements, both EQT and EQM 
have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code). The 
Codes and Company policies provide ethical guidelines and 
expectations for employees, directors, and officers as well 
as suppliers, vendors, agents, contractors, and consultants. 
Last updated in November 2013, the Codes are available to 
all stakeholders on the investor relations sites of eqt.com and 
eqtmidstreampartners.com. 
Senior leadership is responsible for approving the Codes and 
related policies. The Company requires that all employees 
annually certify their understanding and compliance with the 
EQT Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, related Company 
policies, and, if applicable, the EQM Code of Business Conduct 
and Ethics. All employees must similarly comply with the 
Company’s antitrust policy, last updated January 1, 2006, and 
abstain from any activity that might violate applicable antitrust 
laws or give any appearance of violation or an intention to 
violate.  EQT also has a Company policy, last updated on 
November 1, 2010, outlining the responsibilities of Company 
officers, directors, employees, agents, and vendors to comply 
with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). 
EQT provides compliance and ethics training to employees in 
a number of formats. New employees, based on their roles 
and responsibilities, must complete mandatory compliance 
training within the first few months of employment. These 
online courses cover a variety of themes found within the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics as well as 
corporate policies, including anti-corruption and antitrust 
compliance. Existing employees receive conflicts of interest 
training on a needs basis, determined by the business leaders 
or compliance and ethics department. In addition, select 
employees receive annual and ad hoc training according to 
applicable regulatory requirements. 
During 2014, 335 new employees completed the online 
Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics training, representing 
approximately 19% of the total employee population. Similarly, 
333 new employees completed the online Conflicts of Interest 
training, also representing approximately 19% of the total 
employee population.
During the same period, another 320 employees received in-
person training on the Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics 
and the Conflicts of Interest policy (approximately 18% of total 
employee population), including approximately 145 employees 
from the accounting, finance, legal, and other control functions 
within the organization.
EQT monitors the effectiveness of its anti-corruption and 
antitrust efforts by reviewing the number of allegations and 
substantiated cases received through the Compliance Hotline, 
the Compliance Network, and other internal or external 
communication channels; any negative trends in the number 
of allegations and substantiated cases of corruption or anti-
competitive behavior may lead to potential modifications to the 
policies and procedures. 
EQT also looks to the Company’s fraud risk assessment to 
identify where significant risks related to corruption might occur 
throughout the organization. The latest assessment, facilitated 
by an independent subject matter expert, covered 11 categories 
of fraud risk:
• Cyber fraud
• Third party/vendor fraud – contract fraud
• Third party/vendor fraud – integrity and governance risks
• Third party/vendor fraud – procurement fraud
• Capital projects
• Theft of goods or services
• Financial reporting fraud
• Misappropriation of assets
• Fraudulent acquisition of revenues or assets
• Fraudulent avoidance of expenses
• Fraudulent misconduct by senior management 
The fraud risk assessment identified no significant risks related 
to corruption within EQT or EQM, and there were no legal actions 
pending or completed regarding anti-competitive behavior or 
violations of antitrust and monopoly legislation during 2014.

POSITIVE ECONOMIC BENEFITS
During 2014, EQT remained committed to reducing unit costs, maintaining its strong balance 
sheet, and ensuring ample liquidity — all while continuing to execute the Company’s drilling 
program and infrastructure projects at an optimal pace of development in a safe and 
environmentally responsible fashion. EQT continues to focus on earning the highest possible 
returns from its investments, in order to increase shareholder value.
EQT’s activities also significantly benefited the U.S. economy, and the direct and indirect 
economic boost the Company provides to local economies in PA, WV, OH, KY, VA, and TX 
remains substantial — creating financial benefits for investors, employees, suppliers, local 
business owners, and numerous other stakeholders.

EQT Production achieved record-setting production sales 
volumes of 79.4 Mboe for 2014, representing a 26% increase 
over 2013. Approximately 79% of EQT’s 2014 production sales 
volume came from horizontally drilled Marcellus wells, with 
Marcellus volumes increasing 37.5% year-over-year. 
All EQT operating activities in 2014 were onshore, primarily 
within the states of PA, WV, KY, VA, TX, and OH. The data 
presented is consistent with the Company’s 2014 Form 10-K 
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
To determine reserves, EQT’s Vice President of Engineering 
uses collected well data. A third-party auditor reviewed 100% 
of the total net gas and liquid hydrocarbon proved reserves 
attributable to the Company’s interests as of December 31, 
2014. The auditor conducted a detailed well-by-well review 
of EQT’s largest properties, which accounted for 80% of 
the Company’s proved reserves. The audit of the remaining 
20% of EQT’s properties consisted of aggregated groups not 
exceeding 200 operational wells per group, and 230 non-
operational wells per group. For undeveloped locations, 
the auditor determined which of the Company’s acreage to 
classify as proven. Reserves were assigned and projected by 
the Company’s reserves engineers for locations within these 
proven areas and approved by the auditor based on analogous 
type curves and offset production information. EQT filed the  
audit report as Exhibit 99 of its Form 10K, dated February 12, 
2015, submitted to the U.S. SEC.

Each year EQT reviews its economic contributions as related to 
its primary operating states, as well as to the U.S. economy as 
a whole.  This annual economic evaluation is shown in terms 
of gross domestic product (GDP), employment, labor income, 
employee compensation, state and local tax revenues, and 
royalty payments. These benefits are classified as direct (EQT 
and direct contractors); indirect (supplier-level); and induced 
(economic activity associated with spending by EQT, its direct 
contractors, and its suppliers’ employees). 
EQT’s Contributions to the Economy of the United States
EQT’s activities in 2014 benefited the U.S. economy in  
multiple ways, including the support of 48,000 ancillary jobs;  
$5.2 billion in contributions to the U.S. GDP; and $314 million 
paid in state and local tax revenues. The charts below 
summarize these activities and the resulting economic  
benefits, the majority of which occurred in EQT’s six primary 
operating states.

Calculation Method
EQT contracted with an external firm, FTI Consulting, to 
perform an independent analysis of the Company’s eco -
nomic contributions using the IMPLAN model to estimate 
the economic impact and jobs creation resulting from EQT’s 
2014 activities. The IMPLAN model is a general input-output 
modeling software and data system that tracks the movement 
of money through an economy, looking at linkages between 
industries along the supply chain, to measure the cumulative 
effect of spending in terms of job creation, income, produc -
tion, and taxes. IMPLAN provides the economic ripple effect, 
or multiplier effect, that tracks how each dollar of input, or 
direct spending, cycles through the economy to suppliers and 
ultimately to households.
Employment Contributions
EQT’s employment contributions extend well beyond its direct 
employees. EQT retains a significant number of contractors 
to support its production and transportation investments and 
operations. Additionally, the earnings spent by the employees 
of EQT, its direct contractors, and its suppliers contribute 
to employment in sectors that provide them with goods and 
services (induced impact). Total employment contributions, 
including EQT’s 1,750 employees, were estimated at 49,750 
persons employed in the U.S.

Employee Compensation
EQT’s activities support U.S. employment and provide 
well-paying jobs to its staff, direct contractors, and its sup -
pliers. In 2014, on average, EQT provided compensation to its 
employees, direct contractors, and suppliers that exceeded the 
U.S. estimated median household income of $55,000.  
Source:  Sentier Research “Household Income Trends June 2015Gross Domestic Product (Value-Added)
EQT contributed $5.2 billion in GDP or value-added to the 
U.S. economy in 2014. The majority of the GDP impacts (68%) 
occurred in the states where EQT operates. The remaining 
32% of GDP contributions were from out-of-state suppliers 
that provided goods and services for operational activities in 
EQT’s six primary operating states. 
At $2.4 billion or 46% of the total, EQT’s activities in 
Pennsylvania represented the largest U.S. GDP contribution.

MAINTAINING A DIVERSE AND  
LOCAL SUPPLY CHAIN
EQT’s procurement function is essential to achieving a 
best-value supply chain that ensures safe and responsible 
operations. The Company works to build open and honest 
relationships with local and diverse suppliers who can 
provide innovative solutions, high-quality goods and services, 
competitive pricing, and are able to perform consistently as 
required by Company operations. 
The procurement department manages numerous control 
and compliance processes, facilitating a selection of suppliers 
that can best help to meet the Company’s performance and 
sustainability goals and values. These processes, which 
include purchase order approval limits, competitive bid 
requirements, and periodic reviews of spend allocations,  
also ensure conformity with environmental, safety, and  
legal requirements set forth by the Company.  
To ensure a quality supply chain, EQT’s procurement team 
works with the business segments to monitor supplier 
performance — implementing corrective actions if needed. 
The Company also evaluates its procurement strategies, 
procedures, and reporting activities regularly, including  
items such as:
• Spend / le verage strategies
• Supplier selection pr ocess and associated due diligence
• Evaluation of suppliers’ ISNetWorld® safety ratings• Consistent application of the Codes of Business Conduct 
to the Company’s supply chain
• Suppliers ’ utilization of electronic invoicing rather  
than paper
• EQT maintains an ongoing dial ogue with its suppliers 
regarding areas, issues, or concerns that may cause 
negative impact or perception. As such, adjustments can 
be made that provide a mutually beneficial solution for all 
parties — one such adjustment led to offering discount 
payment terms for suppliers looking to improve their cash 
flow position. In addition to maintaining effective sourcing 
processes and procedures, contract management also 
plays an active role in handling vendor compliance.  
Before execution of any supplier agreement, the vendor 
must meet prescribed compliance requirements, and 
a supplier cannot commence work until a mutually 
acceptable contract is fully executed.
• To support the Company in its commitment to ethical 
behavior, the majority of vendors receive an annual 
notification of their obligation to comply with the Codes 
of Business Conduct and Ethics, and specifically, their 
responsibility to be aware of actual or apparent conflicts 
of interest. EQT does not track the communication of 
anti-corruption policies to business partners by type 
or location, however, in 2014 approximately 1,650 EQT 
and 200 EQM vendors received the notification letter. 
As a follow-up, EQT completed vendor audits for those 
companies identified in EQT’s most recent fraud risk 
assessment as having higher-risk profiles.  All vendors 
Go back to Table of Contents45ECONOMIC IMPACT
have access to the Codes of Business Conduct and 
Ethics via the EQT and EQM public websites, and most 
procurement contracts require that vendors comply  
with the Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics, or 
a similar code that complies with the U.S. Federal 
Sentencing Guidelines.  
EXPANDING LOCAL CONTENT
EQT spends money with large and small suppliers throughout 
the U.S.; however, the Company values the benefits of 
supporting local economic development and is committed  
to awarding procurement contracts locally where possible. 
EQT defines local spend as purchases from suppliers based 
within one of the six states where the Company conducts 
significant business activity and makes purchases to support 
that activity.  During 2014, the local spend with suppliers 
located within the Company’s six-state operating footprint  
(PA, WV, KY, VA, OH, TX) was 88% of the total procurement 
budget. After careful consideration during the selection 
process, the Company strives to select local suppliers when  
all other factors are equal.
All suppliers, whether local or national, are subject to the 
same general consideration requirements, including:
• Safety  – Safe and environmentally friendly operations are 
imperative at EQT; and suppliers must achieve “approval 
status” (as applicable to the good or service provided) by 
the Company’s Safety Department and by ISNetworld®.                                                                  
• Value  – EQT places significance on the overall value that 
suppliers offer. Suppliers who differentiate their offerings 
from their competitors through increased value usually 
merit greater consideration
• Price  – EQT takes pride in being a responsible operator 
and a low-cost producer; therefore, in many cases, lower 
supplier costs are looked upon favorably as it enables the 
Company to achieve cost-savings  
• Quality  – As EQT strives to be a good neighbor by 
respecting the communities where it operates, 
the Company demands best-in-class supply chain 
performance that mirrors this expectation
• Delivery  – Along with being a low-cost producer, on-time 
delivery is a critical measurement consideration to avoid 
expensive operational delays
IDENTIFYING DIVERSE BUSINESSES
To encourage diverse supplier utilization, EQT actively tracks 
the number of diverse suppliers, the aggregate spend, and 
the percentage of total spend going to diverse suppliers; and 
in turn, reports this information to the Company’s senior 
management. EQT defines diverse businesses as: Minority Business Ent erprise (MBE) : A for-profit 
enterprise, regardless of size, physically located in the 
United States or its territories; and owned, operated, 
and controlled by minority group members. “Minority 
group members” are U.S. citizens who are Asian, 
African American, Hispanic, and Native American. 
Ownership by minority individuals means the business  
is at least 51% owned by such individuals or, in the 
case of a publicly owned business, one or more such 
individuals own at least 51% of the stock. Further, those 
minority group members control the management and 
daily operations. 
 Woman Business Enterprise (WBE) : An independent 
business concern where one or more women, who are 
U.S. citizens or Legal Resident Aliens, own and control 
at least 51% of the organization. For these entities, the 
business formation and principal place of business  
must be in the U.S. or its territories; and one or more  
of the women owners control the management and  
daily operation of the business. 
 Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 
(SDVOSB):   
A “small business concern owned and controlled by 
service-disabled veterans.” For consideration as a 
SDVOSB, a business must meet the following criteria: 
• Not less than 51% is owned by one or more service-
disabled veterans or, in the case of any publicly owned 
business, not less than 51% of the stock is owned by one 
or more service-disabled veterans, and 
• The management and daily busines s operations are 
controlled by one or more service-disabled veterans 
or, in the case of a veteran with permanent and severe 
disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such  
a veteran
To enhance its awareness and access to local and minority 
suppliers, EQT uses national and regional councils, chambers, 
and coalitions to help identify qualified local bidders. In 2014, 
the Company expanded its supplier outreach to include 
educational seminars, including supplier diversity education, 
to build the capacity of local firms hoping to expand into the 
natural gas industry. The following organizations helped to 
facilitate these efforts with their members: 
• African American Chamber of Commerce of Western 
Pennsylvania (AACCWP)
• Houston Minority Supplier Development Council (HMSDC)
• Marcellus Shale Coalition (MSC)—EQT participates on the 
Supply Chain Steering Committee.
• Southwes t Minority Supplier Development Council 
(SMSDC)Go back to Table of Contents46• Supplier Diver sity Matchmaker
• Women’s Business Council-Southwest (WBCS)
• Women’s Business Enterprise Council (WBEC)
• Eastern Minority Supplier Development Council (EMSDC)
EQT sponsors and participates in EMSDC’s annual Business 
Opportunity Fair, and Company procurement personnel 
volunteer on EMSDC’s Education, Certification, and Planning 
Committees. EQT employees also provide guidance and 
leadership by serving on the EMSDC Board of Directors. 
ENCOURAGING INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS WITH  
LOCAL AND DIVERSE SUPPLIERS
EQT also supports WBEC’s annual matchmaking event to 
help identify qualified suppliers. Borrowing from that model, the 
Company co-sponsors an annual industry matchmaker event 
where EQT helps connect local suppliers with other energy 
companies to develop potential business opportunities. In fact, 13 
of the Company’s top suppliers attended the industry matchmaker 
event in 2014; many of these relationships stemming from 
individual meetings held during this annual event.
All of these events boost EQT’s pursuit of qualified local 
suppliers, and they support the Company’s efforts to 
encourage its first-tier suppliers and contractors to  
buy locally. To motivate these first-tier suppliers and  
contractors, EQT implemented several targeted procurement 
initiatives, including: 
• Adding language in EQT and EQM Requests f or Proposals  
that strongly encourage prime suppliers to seek out and 
include diverse businesses as part of their proposed solution 
• Requiring all vendor s to complete and submit a sub-
contracting document with their proposal identifying 
where and how they will utilize local vendors as part of 
the bidding process 
• Conducting meetings with EQT’s t op suppliers to provide 
diversity education, outline reporting requirements for 
sub-contracting with diverse suppliers, and identify specific commodities purchased by the top suppliers to 
align them with diverse firms selling those products  
• Tracking local and diverse vendor usage by asking top 
Company suppliers to provide their monthly spend with 
diverse sub-contractors and local suppliers
EXPANDING LOCAL ECONOMIES  
THROUGH SUPPLIER GROWTH
Identifying new suppliers to bid on projects is important; 
however, EQT also works closely with existing and successfully 
performing companies to identify opportunities to expand the 
work that they do for the Company. When a firm demonstrates 
scalable service capabilities, the Company works closely with 
them to mentor and effectively expand the capacity of their 
business offerings.  As these firms grow their capabilities,  
the Company considers them for larger projects, often 
resulting in the award of additional work and directly affecting 
the local workforce in a positive way.   
This type of proactive support for capacity building earned  
EQT the 2014 Eastern Minority Supplier Development Council’s 
Corporation of the Year Award, the Corporate Advocate of 
the Year Award, the Harold T. Bushey Award, the Corporate 
Volunteer of the Year Award, and the Economic Impact Award.  
The Company also received the Shining Star Award from the 
Women’s Business Enterprise Council.
 “EQT values the benefits of supporting local 
economic development and is committed  
to awarding procurement contracts locally 
where possible.

G4-13 In June 2014, EQT exchanged certain assets 
with Range Resources Corporation. The 
Company received approximately 73,000 
net acres and approximately 900 producing 
wells, most of which were vertical wells in the 
Permian Basin of Texas. In exchange, Range 
Resources received approximately 138,000 
net acres in EQT’s Nora Field of Virginia, the 
Company’s working interest in approximately 
2,000 producing vertical wells in Nora, the 
Company’s remaining 50% ownership in Nora 
Gathering, LLC, and $167.3 million in cash. 
This transaction also resulted in a significant 
reduction in EQT’s workforce in Virginia 
and an increase in Texas; many of these 
employees either relocated to other EQT 
facilities or transferred to Range Resources.None Not applicable Not applicable No
