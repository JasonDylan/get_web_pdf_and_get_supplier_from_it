ABOUT OUR  
SUSTAINABILITY  
REPORTING
Cummins’ sustainability 
reporting is primarily 
connected to four postings 
in the hope of reaching the 
right people with the right 
information at the right time.SUSTAINABILITY 
PROGRESS REPORT
This document is Cummins’ 2017 
Sustainability Progress Report, 
which reflects the company’s broad 
view of sustainability, including 
the environment, corporate 
responsibility, safety, diversity  
and inclusion, innovation, financial 
performance and our newest  
section on customer support.
As a signer of the United Nations’ 
Global Compact in 2017, Cummins 
supports the U.N.’s 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals to “end poverty, 
protect the planet and ensure 
prosperity for all.” See the notations 
on page 6 of this report where we 
believe our disclosures align with 
those aspirations.
We’ve continued working to make 
this report shorter and easier to read, 
moving many of the feature stories 
to The Newsroom on cummins.
com. We try to post at least one 
sustainability related story there  
per week. We also continue to  
move some data to our GRI Data 
Book, which can be found where  
we post all of our sustainability 
related documents.
This report was completed in  May 2018 and is Cummins’  
15th edition.CUMMINS  
GRI DATA BOOK
The company is again  
producing a separate posting  
called Cummins’ GRI Data  
Book. It follows the format of the  
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). 
Established by the United Nations, 
the GRI’s goal is to develop a 
consistent way for companies  
to report on their environmental, 
social and economic performance. We’ve also added some data we 
believed didn’t fit in the Progress 
Report, but was still important 
to disclose. The data book also 
includes an update on materiality.
The 2017 Cummins GRI Data  
Book will be posted by the end  
of June 2018.
CDP
Cummins is committed to  
sharing its CDP (formerly the  
Carbon Disclosure Project)  
water and climate filings.  
The 2017 filings will be posted  
in our repository sometime in  
July. The 2016 reports are  
available now.SUSTAINABILITY 
OVERVIEW
Cummins has also put together 
another eight-panel sustainability 
brochure to give readers a  
very high level look at the  
company’s sustainability efforts.  
The overview is posted with our 
other sustainability related reports  
in our document repository.

THE COVER
A validation team 
makes its way up  
a mountain road  
at Loveland Pass  
(6.7 percent grade  
at 11,990 feet),  
during testing  
of Cummins’ X12  engine in Colorado 
(U.S.A.) in 2017.The dependability of Cummins’ 
products is critical to the  
company’s sustainability, so 
Cummins engineers put them  
to the test before they go into 
production and reach customers.
Validation testing takes place  
not only in the U.S., but in China, 
India, the U.K. and elsewhere.  
U.S.-based teams in Columbus, Indiana have traveled as far as 
Fairbanks, Alaska, and Death  
Valley, California, to find the  
ideal combination of  
temperature and grade.The trips often take several weeks, under less than ideal conditions,  
but Cummins engineers love the 
chance to go in-depth on the 
company’s products, free of any 
distractions. You can learn more 
about validation testing, and 
numerous other aspects of the 
company’s business, by going to 
The Newsroom on cummins.com. 
Cummins tries to post at least one 
story a week on the website relative  
to the company’s sustainability.

PROGRESS REPORT 2017
6A NOTE FROM  
THE CHAIRMAN 
Greetings,
There are two critical challenges 
when it comes to the sustainability  
of a business like Cummins:
 »Achieving our mission of “powering a more prosperous 
world,” while meeting our 
obligation to use fewer of  
its resources.
 »Helping customers succeed 
through innovation and 
dependability, so when  
they win, we win.Neither is easy, but after more than 
25 years with Cummins, first as a 
wide-eyed summer intern and today 
as CEO of this nearly 100-year-old 
company, I can say with confidence we are up to the challenge.
Just in 2017, Cummins started 
production on the cleanest, most 
fuel efficient diesel engine our 
company has ever made, the X15. 
Our Cummins Westport joint venture 
launched a natural gas engine 
achieving emission levels 90 percent 
below EPA standards for a key contributor to smog. 
We started a new joint venture  
with Eaton to develop the most 
advanced automatic transmissions 
for medium and heavy-duty vehicles. 
And our company began work on 
an all-electric powertrain for urban 
buses that will be on the market  
by the end of 2019.We did all this without sacrificing 
our customers’ need for affordable, 
dependable power. That’s why I say, 
without hesitation, that innovation is 
good for customers and good for  the environment, too. It’s time to 
stop pitting the interests of one 
against the other. 
There are challenges, of course. 
Powertrain technologies are 
advancing faster than at any 
moment in my lifetime. We’ve 
just scratched the surface of 
what information technology can do through telematics. And new 
competitors and business models 
are constantly trying to disrupt us.
Cummins continually invests in  
new technologies and business 
areas to bring innovation to our 
customers in a dependable way.  
Our goal is to offer them the full 
range of powertrain technologies  so they can choose the right one  
for their application. Our products must work in extreme heat and bone-chilling cold; high 
in the mountains and far below 
the earth’s surface. And we must 
support and service our products nearly anywhere in the world.
That’s a tall order.  
But if we can help 
customers’ successfully 
transition to increasingly cleaner technologies, using fewer resources, 
we will achieve our 
mission of making people’s lives better by powering a more 
prosperous world.
Thank you for your interest  
in Cummins,

PROGRESS REPORT 2017 8  INTRODUCTION
* Excluding charges totaling $777 million in connection with tax reform,  
 full year net income attributable to Cummins was $1.8 billion.HOW WE  
DO IT
Cummins is organized into  
five business segments.  
In 2017, the company introduced 
an electrification division to 
manage its work in that fast 
growing area. In early 2018, 
the division was established 
as Cummins’ fifth business segment, Electrified Power. 
Here's a look at the  
company today:  CUMMINS  
ENGINE  BUSINESS
The Engine Business segment 
manufactures and markets diesel  and natural gas engines for on-  
and off-highway use around the  
world. Markets include heavy-  and medium-duty trucks, buses,  light-duty trucks and areas such  as agriculture, construction and  military equipment.
CUMMINS  
POWER  SYSTEMS
In 2016, Cummins reorganized its 
business, combining the company’s Power Generation segment and its 
high-horsepower engine business 
to create a new Power Systems segment. The segment is a global provider of power generation systems, components, and services in standby power, distributed power generation, 
as well as auxiliary power in mobile 
applications. The segment also designs, manufactures, sells and supports diesel and natural gas high horsepower engines for a wide variety of uses including power generation, 
marine, mining and rail.
 
   COMPONENTS BUSINESS
The Components segment  
is organized around the  following businesses:
 »Cummins Emission Solutions 
designs and builds exhaust 
aftertreatment solutions to  reduce emissions for light-, medium-, heavy-duty and  high-horsepower engines. 
 »Cummins Filtration designs  and builds heavy-duty air, fuel, hydraulic and lube filtration, and chemical and exhaust system technology products.
 »Cummins Fuel Systems designs and manufactures fuel systems that 
maximize power and fuel economy 
while helping to reduce emissions.
 »Cummins Turbo Technologies designs and builds turbochargers  to maximize engine performance and reduce emissions and  fuel consumption.CUMMINS 
DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS 
Cummins Distribution Business sells 
and services the full range of Cummins products for over 20 application 
segments in more than 190 countries 
and territories around the world.
ELECTRIFIED 
POWER
Cummins established its Electrified 
Power segment in early 2018.   This segment brings together all  
of the company’s electrification 
resources into a single reporting segment that posted its results  as part of Cummins' first quarter  earnings in 2018.

  INTRODUCTIONOUR KEY TOOLS
SIX SIGMA AND  
CONTINUOUS  IMPROVEMENT
Cummins is a big proponent  
of Six Sigma, using the business 
improvement tool to save the  
company and its customers  
billions of dollars.
Six Sigma uses data-based analysis to identify defects and  
variation in a wide range of manufacturing and business situations.  
Since its introduction at Cummins in 2000:
 »Approximately 23,000 people have been trained  
on Six Sigma tools at the company, including more  
than 11,400 current professional employees.
 »Six Sigma projects have identified an estimated  
$6.85 billion in Profit Before Interest and Taxes (PBIT) 
savings over the tool’s history at Cummins.
 »Cummins customers have saved an estimated  $1.44 billion through Six Sigma since the tool  
was first offered to them in 2005.Cummins employees also  
use Six Sigma when working  
with community partners on 
Corporate Responsibility projects. 
The tool’s impact, however, goes 
beyond cost savings and community 
engagement. It provides Cummins 
with a common language and 
collective mindset across the 
globe that can be used to address a problem or challenge almost 
anywhere in the world. 
The most impactful projects  
are honored as part of the 
company’s Impact Awards.  
As a continuous improvement 
company, Cummins is committed  
to providing great employees with 
the tools they need to solve the  most important challenges in the 
business, and to recognize the 
outstanding work they do. 
Six Sigma has widely been  
credited with helping turn  
Cummins into the vibrant,  
innovative company it is today.  
After 17 years as a key part  
of Cummins, Six Sigma has established itself as the principal 
problem solving tool used at  
the company.CUMMINS OPERATING SYSTEM 
The purpose of the Cummins Operating System is to continuously  
improve the company’s products and services by eliminating 
waste and reducing variation in processes. The 10 practices are:
PUT THE CUSTOMER FIRST  
AND PROVIDE REAL VALUE.

Products in-use goal at 97 percent completion
Cummins closed in on its 2020 products-in-use goal in 2017, changed logistics  
suppliers and worked on innovative solutions to its facility goals. UN GOALS
Cummins’ environmental 
initiatives align with  at least seven of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty and  ensure prosperity for all.  Here's a look at the seven.
Cummins officials meet with officials 
from Meadow Lake Wind Farm in northwest Indiana. Cummins entered  into an agreement to help the farm expand. To learn more click here.In several areas, facility improvement 
progress slowed as the company 
neared goals and additional gains 
became more challenging. If goals 
are set aggressively, easy gains can  
be accomplished relatively quickly, 
but the remaining advances often  
require significant effort. This has 
been particularly true for energy 
efficiency, where Cummins is  working on its third goal since 2006. 
However, with the ingenuity  
and hard work of more than  
58,000 employees around the  
world, the company is confident  
it will meet its 2020 goals.

HEALTH & SAFETYDIVERSITY & INCLUSIONENVIRONMENTPRODUCTS IN USE  
STRATEGY
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
from Cummins products in use are the 
company’s largest environmental impact 
and represent an estimated 99 percent  
of Cummins’ greenhouse gas (GHG) 
footprint due to fossil fuel use. 
Cummins’ biggest opportunity to expand 
product stewardship beyond the upfront 
design of its products is in working with 
customers to improve the efficiency of the company’s products in use and ensuring 
customers have the latest tools to improve 
fuel efficiency. Cummins’ goal is to partner 
with customers to improve the fuel 
efficiency of the company’s products  
in use, and by extension reduce CO
2.
Cummins wants to cut CO2 emissions 
by nearly 16 million metric tons, saving customers up to $6.3 billion through 
greater fuel efficiency by the end of 2020. 
In meeting this goal, Cummins expects 
to work with about 20 percent of its 
customer base, touching nearly 2 million 
engines as it tailors engine specifications 
to customer applications. Cummins’ fuel economy  
teams throughout the world  
have implemented more than  
250 products in use improvement 
projects since 2014, achieving a  
3.4 million metric ton annual run  
rate of CO2 reduction toward the 
company’s goal of a 3.5 million metric ton run rate by 2020.  
That’s about 97 percent of the  
way to the company’s latest goal.Performance in 2017 built on global momentum, with the launching of 
new initiatives and more Power 
System and Distribution Business 
projects. The average fuel economy 
improvement of nearly 7 percent 
across all projects is larger than the company’s original projections of  
2 to 5 percent improvements.
Global fuel economy teams

HEALTH & SAFETYDIVERSITY & INCLUSIONWATER STRATEGY
The goals of the company’s 
comprehensive water strategy, 
which addresses both direct 
water use and community 
engagement, are to mitigate 
business risk, to be a good 
global citizen and to reduce 
costs and compliance risk.
To achieve the company’s 
50 percent water intensity reduction goal, Cummins will 
expand the work it does with 
its sites in a water management 
program, including support of 
regenerative test cell projects 
using less water, intensive 
engagement with higher  
water use locations, water 
balance studies and strategic capital funding for water 
reduction projects.
Cummins’ strategy also 
identifies the critical role  
water plays in the company’s 
supply chain. The company  
is beginning to work with 
suppliers to help them develop 
less water intensive techniques. Cummins used 962 million gallons of water in 2017, a 32 million gallon 
increase from 2016, but a 10 million 
gallon decrease since the company 
initiated its water strategy in 2014. 
Since the goal’s baseline year of 
2010, direct water use is down  
by 16 percent, while water use 
adjusted for hours worked is down 
by 44 percent – all despite an increase in the number of facilities 
during the that time period.
Cummins’ water neutrality  
work is also progressing well.  
Eight sites have now been  validated as water neutral  toward the company’s 2020  
goal of 15. They are off-setting  
their water use with community 
improvements that either  
conserve water or make  
new sources available.
Meanwhile, a risk analysis  
and mapping exercise of the 
company’s top 200 suppliers, completed in 2016 by Verisk 
Maplecroft, has helped  
Cummins better understand  
water risk in its supply chain.

HEALTH & SAFETYDIVERSITY & INCLUSIONENERGY STRATEGY
Cummins continues to use 
a facility investment plan 
approach, with a focus on 
test cell energy recovery 
and investments in on-site 
renewable projects to offset 
electricity purchased from the 
grid. Ongoing site projects 
include “smart” lighting, and 
improvements to building envelopes and heating and 
cooling systems. The company 
estimates savings of nearly  
$50 million per year from its 
energy efficiency efforts. 
The 2020 energy goal includes 
a commitment to increase the 
amount of energy sourced  
from renewable power.  The company is looking to 
expand onsite renewables 
where it makes sense and has 
committed up to $10 million  
for these projects. Cummins 
has 14 solar installations,  
the most significant being the  
3.6 megawatt installation at  
the Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company Ltd. in China.The company’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased by about 
14,000 tons on an absolute basis in 
2017, but fell 3.6 percent adjusted 
for hours worked compared to 
the prior year. The company has 
now achieved about a 25 percent 
reduction in energy intensity (energy 
use adjusted by hours worked) 
toward its 2020 goal of a 32 percent reduction at company facilities.
Cummins’ primary energy 
consumption increased by 6 percent 
on an absolute basis while falling 
by 0.9 percent adjusted for hours 
worked compared to 2016. 
The company had a number  
of challenges in maintaining  
progress on its goal, including several new buildings and  distributor locations that were  part of the Distribution Business 
segment’s North American 
consolidation.
Cummins uses tools and  
resources available from  
programs such as ISO 50001,  
the international energy  
management system standard,  
and the U.S. Department of  Energy’s Superior Energy 
Performance program.  
The company plans to  
implement ISO 50001 at  
40 sites, or 90 percent of its  
carbon footprint, by 2020.  
Twenty six sites have been  
certified through 2017.

2016HARNESSING  WIND POWER
Cummins entered into a Virtual 
Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA) 
to expand a northwest Indiana  
wind farm in 2017. 
The company’s analysis showed 
that the VPPA was the most 
cost-effective way for Cummins to 
quickly encourage significant GHG 
reductions compared to investing  
in more onsite installations. 
The expansion will add 75 
megawatts to the existing  
600 megawatt capacity at the 
Meadow Lake Wind Farm  
complex. When fully operational in 
early 2019, the wind farm expansion 
will generate renewable electricity 
equivalent to the amount Cummins 
uses at all of its Indiana facilities.
The project will reduce GHG 
emissions by 165,000 metric tons 
CO2e per year (CO2 equivalent), 
which is equal to 21 percent  
of Cummins’ global GHG footprint.

HEALTH & SAFETYDIVERSITY & INCLUSIONWASTE  
STRATEGY
The company follows a 
waste management hierarchy 
consistent with current industry 
standards: avoid the generation 
of waste, reuse, recycle, and 
recover energy from waste. 
Reducing packaging is one 
key way Cummins avoids the 
generation of waste. Reusing 
waste might involve reusing pallets or finding an alternative 
use without any reprocessing. 
Recovery and reuse of  
coolants and solvents is  
still another example.
The recycling of metals,  
paper or wood also reduces  
the amount of waste that  
has to be disposed.  The company’s ultimate  
goal is “Zero Disposal”  
at 30 Cummins facilities  
by 2020.Cummins in 2017 recycled  
90 percent of the total waste  
the company generated  
over the year, equivalent to  
approximately 186,000 tons.
Since the baseline year of 2010, 
Cummins’ total waste disposed 
decreased by about 3 percent in 
absolute terms, while experiencing 
a 36 percent reduction in disposal adjusted for hours worked.
Compared with 2016,  
Cummins’ total waste disposed  
in 2017 increased by 801 tons  
or 4 percent on an absolute  
basis and by 2 percent adjusted  
for hours worked.
There are currently 10 sites certified 
as Zero Disposal – seven in Europe, and one each in North America,  
the Asia-Pacific region and the  
China region. Eighteen additional sites are approaching Zero Disposal, but face challenges such 
as regulatory barriers in India and 
China, and the absence of vendors 
to help with hard-to-recycle wastes. 
Under Cummins’ definition of  
Zero Disposal, waste can only be 
burned as a last resort to create 
energy and then only if there is a  
net energy gain, creating more energy than is needed merely  
to sustain combustion.Cummins is also committed  
to avoiding the generation of 
hazardous waste and properly 
handling hazardous materials  
in the workplace. The definition  
for what constitutes hazardous 
waste varies widely by country. 
Cummins follows all appropriate 
local and regional regulations.  
For U.S. sites that produce hazardous waste, Cummins has  
a formal vendor pre-qualification 
process to ensure waste is  
handled properly. 
 WASTE GOALS
INCREASE COMPANY  RECYCLING RATE TO  95 PERCENT BY 2020.
REACH “ZERO DISPOSAL” 
STATUS AT 30 SITES WITH 100 OR MORE PEOPLE BY 2020  WHERE 100 PERCENT  OF WASTE IS REUSED,  RECYCLED OR RECOVERED IN A  USEFUL MANNER.

STRATEGY
In meeting the company’s 
logistics goal, Cummins aims  
to create and maintain an 
efficient transportation network 
that reduces CO2 emissions by 
improving transport planning to maximize loads, reduce miles 
when trucks are empty and 
minimize distance traveled.A change in Cummins’ 
transportation management system 
impacted the company’s baseline 
data and additional data collected.
In 2017, Cummins changed its 
transportation management system 
provider.  The new system has been 
rolled out to all suppliers in the U.S., 
with Mexico expected to be added 
in 2018.  
Regional optimization solutions are 
planned throughout the company, 
starting with India and Europe in 
2018, and Africa, Brazil and Asia  
in 2019.  By the end of 2019,  
80 percent of the Cummins  
network will be using an  
optimized transportation solution.
The change is expected to result 
in more accurate data, but the 
company will be unable to report  
its progress until the baseline data  
is stable, which is expected by  
mid-2018.

In 2017, Cummins signed on to the Science Based Targets  
Initiative (SBTI) that uses environmental science to support  
companies with GHG reduction target setting, consistent  
with limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius or lower.
Cummins’ commitment will apply to its next facility energy and  
GHG reduction target to be announced in 2019. Cummins’ three 
energy/GHG reduction goals (including the current one with a goal 
completion date of 2020) have used the principles and data of  
science based target setting while not officially part of the initiative. 
And while not required, the SBTI encourages companies to set  a science based target for the sources of its large Scope 3  
emissions, which for Cummins is the company’s products in  
use that represent 99 percent of its GHG footprint.

SOLVE COMPLEX 
PROBLEMS
Cummins’ partnerships and its policy 
advocacy efforts play key roles in the 
company’s environmental strategy and 
performance.
They help Cummins meet product 
emission goals, use energy more 
efficiently and bring environmental 
solutions to the marketplace. Four 
of the company’s 10 environmental 
sustainability principles focus on 
partnerships with legislative and 
regulatory entities to develop sound 
public policy that reduces Cummins’ 
impact on the environment.
They are:
 »Help develop  
responsible regulations.
 »Promote technology  development.
 »Advocate for incentives  to accelerate progress.
 »Support a balanced  global approach.TIGHTER REGULATIONS 
GLOBALLY
Cummins has a long history of 
demonstrating its leadership in 
developing the technologies needed 
to meet tough emissions standards 
and improve fuel efficiency. 
Emissions regulations will continue 
to get tighter globally and the new 
frontier is around greenhouse gas 
(GHGs). With emerging technologies, 
the landscape on regulations is also shifting. For example, more local 
governments are setting emissions 
requirements at a pace and rate 
unlike national standards.
Phase 2 for U.S. GHG/fuel efficiency 
regulations passed in 2016 contain 
separate engine standards.  
Cummins continues to support 
this regulation and in 2017 worked to implement the requirement in company products. The first phase 
goes into effect in 2021.  
Cummins is also advocating  
for separate engine standards 
around the world as other regions 
consider GHG regulations.  
The company also continues 
working to achieve lower levels 
of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) in its product 
emissions globally. Over the next  
five years, India, China, Mexico, 
Brazil and other countries will move 
to the very low emissions levels 
contained in the Euro VI and EPA 
2010 emissions standards for  
on-highway products.
CUMMINS COMMITMENT
This is a challenge and a great step 
forward – the number of people 
living in markets regulated at these 
stringent levels will increase from  
1 billion today to more than 3 billion.
In the U.S., Cummins is  
committed to working with both  
the Environmental Protection  
Agency (EPA) and the California  
Air Resources Board (ARB) to maintain a national, heavy-duty  
NOx and GHG program,  
determining the best path for 
achieving impactful reductions.BUSINESS COALITIONS  
AND COUNCILS
Cummins is a member of several key  
organizations that promote sustainability  and responsible technology, including:
 »The DIESEL TECHNOLOGY FORUM, which is dedicated to raising 
awareness about the importance of clean diesel engines, fuel 
and technology. Since its founding in 2000, the forum has 
emerged as a leading source of information on agriculture, 
economics, energy, the environment, transportation and trade 
issues impacting diesel technology.
 »The HEALTH EFFECTS INSTITUTE, which is a non-partisan organization founded by the EPA and industry leaders, 
including Cummins, to provide high quality, impartial, and 
relevant science regarding the effects of air pollution on health.
 »BSR (formerly Business for Social Responsibility), which works 
with member companies to develop sustainable business strategies through research and cross-sector collaboration.
 »The ROCKY MOUNTAIN INSTITUTE’S BUSINESS  RENEWABLES CENTER, which is a member-based platform  
that works to streamline and accelerate corporate  
procurement of off-site, utility-scale wind and solar energy. 
 »The INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL ON CLEAN TRANSPORTATION, which is an initiative to help 20 large cities around the world address air quality standards and combat climate change. 
Cummins and other manufacturers have committed to  
making it easier for these major cities to purchase buses 
equipped with low-emissions technologies.

LEADERSHIP  
ENGAGEMENT
Cummins has a legacy of strong leadership dedicated to 
responsible corporate citizenship. With the roots of employee community engagement firmly embedded, Cummins CEO  Tom Linebarger issued a call to action to all Cummins leaders:  “Leaders do not delegate corporate responsibility.” Today, Cummins leaders  
directly engage in community 
involvement projects, serve as 
sponsors of community engagement 
teams and recognize employees’ 
volunteer efforts.
Direct leadership engagement  
was the catalyst to launch the 
company’s first global strategic 
community program, Cummins TEC: Technical Education  
for Communities. The Cummins  
TEC program educates and trains 
low-income youth in employable 
technical skills and connects them 
to good jobs in their communities. 
From a few pilots in 2012,  
the program has expanded to  
22 TEC schools now operating around the world, including  
the first U.S. site in Memphis,  
Tennessee (U.S.A.).
Following the success of  
Cummins TEC, in early  
2018 Cummins launched  Cummins Powers Women, 
a $10.6 million investment in 
the company’s most ambitious 
community initiative ever. Cummins 
Powers Women is the next phase 
of Cummins’ commitment to 
large-scale community impact and 
powering a more prosperous world.
Through Cummins Powers 
Women, the company will  partner with a network of best- 
in-class non-profit organizations  
with existing, outcome-based 
programs working to advance 
women in Cummins’ communities  
around the world. 
Cummins’ investment will  
support a range of effective 
programs, including grass-roots teaching and mentoring, financial  
 stability through entrepreneurship, leadership training, and strategic 
guidance to non-profit leaders. 
Cummins’ regional leadership  
teams will spearhead this global 
effort, working closely with the  
non-profits in their regions  
to find solutions to gender  
inequality in the communities Cummins serves.
The program is another  
example of Cummins living  
its mission to build a more 
prosperous world.
Cummins TEC: Technical Education

HEALTH & SAFETYDIVERSITY & INCLUSIONCUMMINS WORKS TO 
BECOME WORLD CLASS 
IN HEALTH AND SAFETY
At Cummins, our employees’ health  
and safety are the company’s highest 
priorities. Our employees are Cummins’  
most important asset and critical to  
the company’s sustainability.
For much of the past decade, 
Cummins has been on a journey  
to become world class in health  
and safety. The company’s 
Corporate Health & Safety team  
has led a multi-year effort to develop 
a culture where employees are fully 
engaged and committed to making 
Cummins a healthier and safer place 
to work. While significant strides have been achieved, even one 
incident is too many.
According to the most recent 
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
data published in 2016, the 
average Injury/Illness Rate (per 
200,000 hours worked) is 3.6 for 
manufacturing and 2.8 for the engine 
equipment manufacturing industry. By comparison, Cummins' Injury /  Illness Rate, also known as its 
Incidence Rate, was 0.691 for 
employees in 2017 and 0.926 
for contractors. There were no 
employee fatalities in 2017.
While the company’s average 
Injury/Illness Rate for employees 
and contractors showed increases 
over 2016, Cummins believes the company is strongly positioned to 
achieve its long term goals, including 
a 38 percent improvement in the 
Injury/Illness Rate over the next five 
years (see the goals on page 27). 
The Health & Safety team offers 
hazard prevention, control tools and 
guidance in more than 15 different areas ranging from driver safety, 
hand safety, and lockout / tag-out 
procedures, to machine guarding 
and working safely at heights.  
By taking direct action through 
training and by establishing the  
right culture, Cummins believes it 
can best protect its most important 
asset – its employees.
The company has proven this 
historically, reporting over the past 
decade a 47 percent reduction in 
Cummins’ overall recordable injuries 
and an over 60 percent reduction in 
injuries resulting in lost days. 
Cummins believes what matters 
most to achieve an injury free 
workplace is fostering a culture 
of caring along with a spirit of interdependence. Every employee 
must look out not only for their  
own safety, but for the safety of  
their co-workers, family, friends  
and communities.ERGONOMICS 
PROGRESS
Cummins had a remarkable 
year for ergonomics in 2017, with nearly 1,000 ergonomic 
improvements made across the 
company. These improvements can be partly attributed to the rollout of the Risk Reduction  Index (RRI) metric. The RRI is a leading indicator measuring 
the reduction of ergonomic risk 
through physical improvements.
In Cummins’ first year using this 
metric, the company experienced 
several improvements in its 
lagging metrics, including:
 »A 12 percent improvement  
in the Ergonomics  
Incidence Rate.
 »A reduction of ergonomic injuries as a percent of total injuries from 28 percent in  
2016 to 22 percent in 2017.
 »Cummins also had  
143 ergonomic improvements submitted for the company’s internal ergonomic best 
practice competition, with  
an innovative mobile hoist device being the winning project from the Cummins Distribution Business’  
South Pacific location. SOCIAL // HEALTH & SAFETY
DISTRIBUTION 
BUSINESS SEES DRAMATIC CHANGE
Perhaps no change in safety 
culture has been as dramatic as the change in Cummins’ 
Distribution Business.  
The segment’s Incidence  Rate is down four-fold from  its recent peak. Major injuries are down 80 percent from  their high and Lost Work Days 
have been reduced by over 
2,000 days per year.
Work began several years ago 
to change the safety culture 
in the business. Supported 
by new training and other steps, a team led by Health & Safety began building a culture of interdependency, where 
employees look out for their 
own safety and the safety of their co-workers. The team engaged leaders to support  the message and help drive culture change.
“Of course even one injury is 
too many,” said Distribution Business President Tony Satterthwaite, “but I’m 
proud to say the culture in 
the Distribution Business is definitely changing.”

HEALTHY LIFESTYLES
Cummins’ LiveWell Center in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.) is off to a promising 
start. The facility for employees and their families offers a broad range of 
services to get to the root of health issues, treating the cause of disease rather 
than just symptoms. Patients learn to prevent disease by addressing lifestyle 
choices such as what they eat and how much activity they get. Company 
officials are looking for ways that lessons from the center, which is separate 
from the company’s Health & Safety function, can be extended throughout  
the company. The center celebrated its first year in existence in 2017.

KEY ROLE IN 
SUSTAINABILITY
Cummins knows having diverse  
employees doesn’t drive business success 
alone. It’s how the company uses diversity – 
valuing and fully including diverse ideas  
and perspectives in the company’s  
decision making – that makes an impact. Truly making an effort to include, 
appreciate and value the unique 
backgrounds, skills and perspectives 
that each employee brings is 
Cummins at its core. That’s when 
the company is at its best and can 
win for its customers, powering a 
more prosperous world.
Leaders understand the importance 
of diversity and inclusion to a global company. Employees provide 
Cummins with thousands of 
backgrounds, skills, thoughts and 
ideas. One of those differences is 
languages. As a global company,  
Cummins needs employees all  
 over the world speaking the local language to better meet customer 
needs. As a result, the company’s 
employees speak hundreds of 
different languages. 
In early 2017, Chairman and  
CEO Tom Linebarger shared a 
statement with employees about 
the many languages spoken at 
Cummins and the importance of effectively navigating language 
challenges when communicating 
with one another.
Cummins employees gather at the

RESOURCE GROUPS
Employee Resource Groups 
(ERGs) at Cummins are 
voluntary, employee-led 
groups that serve as a 
resource for members and 
the company by fostering a 
diverse, inclusive workplace 
aligned with Cummins’ 
mission, vision and values. 
Cummins has more than 
100 ERGs, which are 
open to all employees and 
provide ample opportunities 
for leadership training, 
cross-cultural learning and 
professional development. 
ERGs can be site specific or 
they can cover a particular 
region. The groups are managed by the company’s 
Global Diversity and  
Inclusion team.
Established around the world, 
ERGs are organized by 
different facets of diversity like 
gender, generation, sexual 
orientation, ethnic heritage, 
mental/physical abilities and characteristics and race.

HEALTH & SAFETYDIVERSITY & INCLUSIONSOCIAL  //  DIVERSITY & INCLUSIONLeaders like Chief Operating 
Officer Rich Freeland shared their 
experiences with these challenges 
and how they approached them. 
Most importantly, they reflected  
on the lessons and takeaways that 
would help employees work through 
challenges when they exist. 
Through this language initiative, 
Cummins is working to ensure every employee feels they can contribute 
and is comfortable speaking up 
when they don’t understand or  
feel they haven’t been understood. 
Collaboration among  
global teams is a key driver of  
Cummins’ success, and without 
these different perspectives,  
the company would lose its  ability to innovate and ultimately,  
its position in the marketplace. 
Simply acknowledging the  
challenge can often be the hardest 
and most uncomfortable part.
By being aware and understanding 
these challenges, and addressing 
them, Cummins is empowering each 
employee to make their voice heard and work more effectively. It’s critical 
to unlocking the power of diversity 
and inclusion.SPENDING ON  
DIVERSE SUPPLIERS
Cummins believes supplier diversity is critical to the company’s  
sustainability efforts. Using diverse suppliers* enables Cummins to tap into the power of diverse thoughts and approaches, increases competition for Cummins' business, and spreads the benefit of economic development to a wider number of communities.
In 2016, Cummins was inducted into the Billion Dollar Roundtable,  
a prestigious advocate for best practices in corporate supplier  diversity. Members must have exceeded $1 billion in annual  spending with diverse suppliers.
The company’s efforts are led by the Global Diversity Procurement  
team, which can be reached through the company’s supplier portal.  Here’s a look at spending since 2010.
* The eight categories of diverse suppliers are: Minority Business Enterprises,

Among its advances in 2017, 
Cummins began production of its 
X15 engine, one of the cleanest, 
most efficient diesel engines the 
company has ever built. And one 
of the company’s joint ventures 
unveiled a natural gas engine 
platform achieving emissions levels 
far below EPA standards for nitrous 
oxide, a key contributor to smog. 
Work on electrified powertrains  
and bio and other renewable

With the unveiling of 
the concept Class 7 
Urban Hauler EV, AEOS, 
Cummins introduced a state-of-the-art battery pack, redefining energy-
efficiency and density 
capabilities for the electric vehicle market.
The lighter, denser battery design 
allows AEOS to hold a longer charge 
for improved range and faster 
charging, reducing down time.
Cummins is committed to leading 
technology in energy storage, power 
electronics, traction motor and 
system and component control for 
commercial applications, and will 
introduce its first electrified product in 2019 for the urban bus market.

OUT WITH THE OLD 
AND IN WITH THE NEW 
In September of 2017, Cummins Repower™ was launched to provide  
more clean, efficient, and reliable turn-key crate engines to the market.
The first engine package released was the R2.8 Turbo Diesel — a small 
4-cylinder engine with modern combustion technology and the emissions 
controls necessary to make it bring old vehicles back to life with ease. 
Doubling the fuel economy while also reducing vehicle emissions is  
not uncommon in many of the typical installations’ daily driving routes.  
In off-road trail riding, R2.8 Turbo Diesel-powered vehicles have proven  
their superiority by consuming one third of the fuel of their gasoline 
companions while providing unrivaled low-end diesel torque.
DIGITAL ACCELERATOR
Customers are looking for convenient and responsive interactions, real-time updates, and information that 
make products safer, more productive, and easier to use. 
In May 2017, Cummins formed a new internal 
organization led by Sherry Aaholm, Cummins Chief 
Information Officer, called the Digital Accelerator. 
This new organization seeks to streamline data-based 
innovation, bringing concepts from the idea stage to 
commercialization at the most efficient and effective pace. PATENTS

TO CUSTOMERS IS  
KEY TO SUCCESS
Keeping customers on the job 
and out of the repair shop is 
critical to Cummins’ business 
and sustainability.That’s why the company takes  
a multi-faceted approach to 
customer support, ranging  
from Cummins’ 24/7 Customer 
Solutions Center, implemented  
in North America in 2017,  
to the company’s Connected 
Diagnostics and telematics,  capable of sending signals  
directly over the air to improve engine and vehicle efficiency.
Cummins’ goal is three-fold:  
prevent trouble, address problems 
quickly and completely, and partner 
in our customers’ success, caring 
as much as they do about the 
challenges they face.
Of course it’s easy to talk  
about customer assistance.  Here’s how Cummins  
demonstrates its commitment:CUMMINS CARE
Cummins answered about  
384,000 customer service calls in 
North America in 2017, merging 
about 20 separate regional 
service phone numbers into one 
easy-to-remember number – 
1-800-CUMMINS™.
Since the introduction of 
1-800-CUMMINS in 2017,  
callers interact with a highly  trained staff capable of answering 
many of their questions, and 
elevating those they can’t to experts. 
Calls had an average wait time of 
90 seconds in 2017 and 70 percent 
of customer issues were resolved 
within 24 hours.
Customers have the option 
to quickly and easily rate their experience by simply grading the  
call at its conclusion on a 1-to- 
5 scale, which Cummins then  
uses for continuous improvement.  LOOKING  
AHEAD
Cummins is investing in  
Human Centered Design  
to better understand its 
customers and their needs.
Human Centered Design 
calls for including the human 
perspective in all steps of 
problem solving to leverage 
diverse perspectives, engage 
customers and end-users, and learn through iterative design 
to effectively deliver innovative, 
customer-centric products  
and services. 
In 2017, over 100 Cummins 
employees were trained in 
Human Centered Design with 
plans for 350 more in 2018. ECONOMIC // CUSTOMER SUPPORT

INNOVATION CUSTOMER SUPPORTETHICS & GOVERNANCEThe company is using what it 
learns in North America to improve 
customer support capabilities 
globally, standardizing processes 
where necessary while recognizing 
local cultures and practices.
Cummins Care also developed 
programs in 2017 to answer 
questions sent via email and  
instant messaging.
TELEMATICS AND 
CONNECTIVITY
The company is also using the 
convergence of telecommunications 
and information technology to 
provide customers the information 
they need to work more efficiently, 
increasing uptime and decreasing 
costly downtime.Cummins’ Connected Diagnostics™, 
for example, enables the company 
to communicate with its engines to 
recommend actions the moment an engine system fault occurs. 
Launched in 2014, Connected 
Diagnostics instantly transmits  
key engine and GPS data  
through a telematics connection, 
immediately applying Cummins’ 
analytics to transform the data  
into actionable information. 
A diagnosis of the fault, and clear 
recommendations regarding the 
continued vehicle operation are  
sent instantly to the operator  
or fleet manager. 
Connected Diagnostics is part of a 
suite of products Cummins offers 
through the use of telematics. 
Connected Advisor™, a service enabled by Connected Diagnostics, helps fleet managers and operators 
prioritize recommendations to 
determine whether something 
requires immediate attention or  
can be scheduled a few days out. 
Connected Software Updates™ 
deliver secure software updates 
for engine calibrations over-the-air, 
without a trip to the repair shop.GUIDANZ™ INCREASES 
UPTIME FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS
Cummins Guidanz is a suite of 
genuine service products, features 
and capabilities launched in 2017.  
It maximizes efficiency by 
streamlining processes associated 
with a service event. 
Guidanz enables service providers 
to offer quicker and more accurate 
service for greater customer 
satisfaction and improved uptime. There are more than 5,000 users 
utilizing Guidanz Web and the 
Guidanz mobile app.
Immediate Assessment, a feature 
of Guidanz, allows service providers 
to pull prioritized fault codes – 
estimating repair time and indicating 
the most likely cause of failure –  
wirelessly through their smart phones or tablets anywhere Internet 
service is available. Even if every 
service bay is full, an assessment 
can be made so the service provider 
can more effectively schedule and 
triage service work.
Customer support lines, telematics 
and helping service providers are just 
three ways Cummins demonstrates it is serious about customer service.BY THE

The Ethics & Compliance function focuses  
on helping Cummins maintain its tradition  
as an ethical company as it grows globally.While it has been renovated and expanded 
many times, the Columbus Engine Plant in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.) goes back to the earliest days of the company and figures such as founder Clessie Cummins and longtime CEO J. Irwin Miller worked within its walls. They established Cummins as an ethical company.ECONOMIC // ETHICS & GOVERNANCE

INNOVATION CUSTOMER SUPPORTETHICS & GOVERNANCEAll company employees worldwide, 
regardless of position, are expected 
to observe high ethical standards 
and comply with the company’s 
Code of Business Conduct.  
The code is built around 10 ethical 
principles the company reinforces 
through more than a dozen online 
training courses.
The courses touch on issues such 
as anti-bribery, conflicts of interest,  
data privacy, export compliance, fair 
labor standards and fair competition.  
In addition, Cummins conducts an annual ethics certification process  
to ensure employees around  
the world understand and follow  
the code and its underlying policies.In 2017, 24,533 employees and 
officers, including all members 
of the Board of Directors, 
completed Cummins’ annual 
Ethics Certification. The Ethics 
& Compliance function reviewed 
any exceptions and worked with 
Cummins’ Human Resources  
staff to ensure they were 
documented and investigated.
Ethics & Compliance also helps 
develop new policies, updates 
existing policies, and provides 
guidance on compliance issues 
around the company. In 2017, the 
function played a key role in the 
drafting of a new Human Rights 
Policy and provided guidance on a 
host of issues such as Sales Agents and Third Party Intermediaries, 
Governmental Sales and Fair 
Competition and Anti-Trust. 
Cummins employees can  
report ethical concerns at

RIGHTS POLICY
Cummins adopted its first Human Rights Policy in 2017, 
addressing human rights violations ranging from human  
trafficking and child labor to forced labor and indentured labor.
The company also commits to supply chain transparency, 
pledging to work with suppliers and partners in high risk 
locations to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and other 
human rights violations.
A story on the policy and the policy itself are publicly  
available in The Newsroom on cummins.com.MAINTAINING  
THE CODE
Training and guidance are not enough to ensure compliance.  
Cummins relies on its employees to speak up if they witness  
behavior they believe violates the Code of Conduct.
Once a potential issue is reported, Cummins has a global team  
of Master Investigators who investigate alleged Code of Conduct  
violations. In 2017, nearly 2,000 cases were investigated.  
Thirty-eight percent of those cases were substantiated and

INNOVATION CUSTOMER SUPPORTETHICS & GOVERNANCECUMMINS WORKS  
TO EFFECTIVELY  
MANAGE RISK
Managing risk effectively is another critical factor in Cummins’ sustainability.  
To get that job done, the company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team  
works with the company’s top leaders, regional leaders in Cummins’ Area  
Business Organizations (ABOs) and Cummins’ Internal Audit function.
The company’s approach to  
risk starts with its Enterprise  
Risk Council, made up of the 
company’s top leaders who,  
working with ERM, oversee  
risk management and provide 
direction on risk-related matters.
The council, established in 2016, 
is part of a framework designed 
to drive continuous improvement in risk management, where risk 
is recognized and responded to 
appropriately. Each company leader 
on the council takes ownership of 
individual risks that could impact  
the company’s growth plans or  
long term sustainability.In 2017, ERM also worked with the leaders of Cummins’ regional 
organizations, known as ABOs, 
to take greater oversight of risk 
management at individual locations 
within the company, especially  
those deemed critical to  
Cummins’ operations.
As of 2017, every Cummins location, 
more than 600 in all, has a Business Continuity Plan. The plan directs 
how each site would operate in the 
midst of a major disruption such  
as a natural disaster affecting the 
location or a major supplier.Sites are required to conduct table-top exercises on a regular basis 
to test how each would react in 
the midst of an emergency. ABO 
leaders are responsible for ensuring 
these exercises are both robust and 
accomplished within their regions.
In addition, more extensive “stress 
tests” are conducted at least 
once every four years by a third party working with ERM and other 
functions at Cummins at the more 
than 70 sites deemed most critical  
to Cummins’ operations.
ERM also keeps a running list of 
nearly 100 top risks facing the 
company. It works with the Internal 
Audit function to prepare special reports on the 20 or so thought to 
present the greatest risk to Cummins 
and reports regularly on them to  
the company’s Board of Directors.
Cummins believes this multi-faceted 
approach is critical to effectively 
managing risk.RISK AND THE 
ENVIRONMENT
Cummins considers 
environmental risks among the top 100  the company faces. 
Among its top 20 risks is 
uncertainty about product 
regulations. This could include 
the regulations themselves or 
enforcement of regulations. 
Cummins supports tough, clear 
and enforceable environmental 
regulations that drive innovation.
The company also includes 
facility compliance with environmental regulations  
a risk within the top 100. 
The company believes it has 
established a strong record 
for compliance with the 
most stringent environmental 
regulations for facilities.TO LEARN MORE

WITH POLICY MAKERS 
TO BUILD A MORE 
PROSPEROUS WORLD
The company’s Government Relations staff advocates globally for 
policies, legislation, government research funding and regulatory 
guidelines that promote products and technologies benefitting  
the environment and other matters important to Cummins.
Efforts in the United States include 
working with Congress, the White  
House, state governments, trade 
associations and industry to protect  
fuel efficiency regulations and 
develop next-tier pollution standards 
for heavy duty vehicles, and to 
broadly educate policy makers  
about how economic development 
and competitiveness can flourish when regulations are tough, clear 
and enforceable.
In China, Cummins continues  
to advocate for the adoption of  
strict emission standards across  
all engines. The company has 
provided the Chinese government  
 with technical advice, global best 
practices and thought leadership in 
preparation for the implementation  
of new emissions regulations  
(NS IV and CS IV).
With decentralization of the 
government approval authority, 
Cummins China effectively  
created a grassroots outreach 
effort engaging the company’s senior regional leadership with 
local Chinese officials to establish 
Cummins as a strong resource  
in environmental and  
manufacturing matters. 
 
 In Europe, Cummins is advocating for future (post Stage V for non-
road and Euro VI for on-highway) 
emissions standards that are tough, 
clear and enforceable and maintain 
focus on the engine. Government 
Relations is also promoting the 
idea of including an engine focused 
element in the heavy duty vehicle 
carbon dioxide (CO
2) emissions 
regulation, rather than solely a  
whole vehicle limit to enable  
further CO2 reductions.
As the company continues 
developing innovative technology 
for customers, Cummins continues 
to partner with policy makers and 
regulators around the world. Cummins CEO Tom Linebarger has forcefully argued for free trade, testifying  
before a congressional committee in 2017 and appearing at a number of forums.  He maintains trade can be good for everyone involved. ECONOMIC // ETHICS & GOVERNANCE // GOVERNMENT RELATIONS

ACTIVITIES
Cummins bans contributions 
using corporate funds to 
candidates, political parties 
and independent expenditures, 
including advertisements that 
support or oppose individual 
candidates.
The company also will not use 
corporate funds to contribute to 
501 (c) (4) and 527 tax-exempt groups in the United States 
that are engaged in political 
activity or make payments to 
influence ballot issues unless 
the issues are directly tied to 
the company’s core values and 
business interests.
In those cases, Cummins is 
committed to publicly disclosing any payments including 
recipient names and amounts. 
The company made no such 
payments in 2017.LOBBYING
Cummins belongs to a number of trade organizations to further business 
interests. While the company might not agree with these associations on every 
matter, Cummins believes they help ensure government leaders know where 
the company stands on key issues. Here’s a list of U.S. trade organizations 
Cummins paid dues in excess of $50,000 during calendar year 2017, as well 
as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which fell below the $50,000 threshold. 
Listed with each entity is Cummins’ estimation of the portion of these dues 
used for lobbying or other political expenditures:POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS
