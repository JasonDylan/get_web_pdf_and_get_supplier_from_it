2019AnnualReport_InsidePages.indd   4 12/18/19   1:50 PM5DEERE DELIVERS SOUND PERFORMANCE 
IN YEAR OF UNCERTAINTY
Despite unsettled conditions that weighed on demand 
for popular models of equipment, John Deere had a  
year of sound performance in 2019 . Among our achievements, we launched important new products with the latest technology and advanced features, improved our competitive position throughout much  
of the world, and took further actions to ensure the success of the strategic plan that will guide our efforts in coming years. Plus, we provided solid returns to  
our shareholders. 
The overall economic picture continued to be positive, 
leading to improved demand for smaller equipment and record sales and profits for 'eere…ïs construction and forestry business. Key agricultural markets, however, remained under pressure. Persistent trade tensions  
and difficult growing and harvesting conditions  
caused many farmers to become cautious about  
making major purchases. 
1et income for fiscal  was . billion a  percent 
increase over 2018 and the second-highest total in company history. Net sales and revenues rose 5 percent, to  . billion a new high. $dMusted for changes  
in the U.S. tax code ‚Äì which reduced 2018 reported earnings by a significant amount …ë net income was  
up 4 percent. 
The company again generated healthy cash flow  
in addition to . billion in economic profit  
or Shareholder Value Added* (SVA). SVA equals 
operating profit minus an implied cost of capital.  
It is a primary measure for managing the company  
and making investment decisions.
'eere maintained its strong financial condition  
ending the year with a healthy cash balance of about 
. billion. 2ur equipment operations carried relatively modest debt while the financialservices business remained conservatively capitalized.
The company…ïs financial performance allowed it to maNe 
further investments in advanced products, technologies, and other growth-oriented projects. For the year,  
'eere devoted . billion to research and development and capital expenditures.$lso nearly . billion was returned to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The quarterly dividend rate was increased during the year by 10 percent, marking the eighth increase in the last decade.  
'eere shareholders reali]ed a total return of  percent for the year versus 14 percent for the broader market.

'eere…ïs financialservices unit made a substantial 
contribution to company earnings while providing competitive financing to our global customers. Its loan and lease portfolio grew by  percent to . billion  
as credit quality continued to be strong. Net income  
was lower mainly due to prioryear ta[ benefits and impairments and higher losses on operating leases  
in 2019 .
GLOBAL TRENDS SUPPORTIVE OF GROWTH
'eere…ïs record of performance has provided a sturdy foundation for the company to capitalize on trends of power and promise. These trends as we…ïve noted in the past, center on a growing global population and an emerging middle class in many parts of the world.
Although commodity prices may show wide variation 
over short periods, demand tends to follow a steadier course. In the last half century, global consumption of

grain and oilseeds has declined only three times and 
risen without interruption for more than two decades. We have every reason to believe this trend of steady growth in demand will continue, requiring increased levels of agricultural production.
At the same time, people are racing to live in cities, 
leading to a greater need for roads, bridges,  
buildings, and the equipment needed to construct  
them. Urbanization also spurs development of an  
economic middle class, especially in fast-growing  
emerging markets. 
PURSUING A FAR-REACHING STRATEGY
These factors point to continuing demand for productive equipment and underscore our company‚Äôs ambitious operating strategy. The plan stresses the importance of technology, global growth, and standout financial performance. It aims to estaElish a more ÕëexiEle cost structure and a more versatile Eusiness and product lineup that can generate solid financial results on a consistent basis.
At the heart of the strategy is a commitment to 
innovation and quality. Throughout our history, Eoth have proved crucial to expanding our gloEal presence and providing customers Zith exceptional productivity and reliable performance.
7In support of our strategic plan, Ze are placing particular emphasis on these areas: 
 ‚ÄìPrecision Technologies. Intensify our efforts in precision technologies, a field certain to define the future of our industries and one in which Deere is committed to being the undisputed leader. Areas of focus include making further advances in vehicle automation and autonomy and increasing the number of customers who choose to manage their farms through our digital operations center. 
 ‚ÄìAftermarket. (xpand Deere…ïs aftermarNet Eusiness Ey increasing our share of parts purchased and service work performed on our products over their life cycle. 
 ‚ÄìCapital Allocation. Ensure a disciplined approach to capital allocation by focusing research and investment dollars on the most promising and profitaEle opportunities. We will, at the same time, conduct a careful assessment of those operations that cannot meet our performance standards. 
 ‚ÄìStructure. Create a leaner organizational structure that can respond to changing market conditions with greater speed and agility. The company has taken a number of streamlining actions in recent months and is evaluating further moves along these lines.
 ‚ÄìTalent. Step up efforts to become a magnet for talented employees, especially those with the technical skills needed to ensure our success as a smart industrial company.

more than 160 million acres of production data. 
PROMOTING SUSTAINABILITY  
IN OPERATIONS & PRODUCTS
John Deere is committed to operating in a safe, environmentally sustainable manner and developing products that disturb the environment to a  
minimal extent.
During the year, a neZ filtration system Zas installed  
at our Greeneville, Tennessee, factory, which reduced 
water usage in the paint system by over 20 percent.  
Also, Deere headquarters and several factories in  
Mexico undertook major composting projects to reduce Zaste that otherZise Zould go to landfills. In another example, a new monitoring system helped manage SETTING THE PACE IN INNOVATION
Long a Deere hallmark, product innovation earned further global recognition last year, including a gold medal and three silver medals from Europe‚Äôs leading agricultural trade fair and a pair of silver medals from a well-regarded agribusiness exhibition in France.  
In addition, a noted group of 8.S. agricultural and biological engineers recognized six of our new products for innovation. Among the honored innovations Zas an advanced tractor transmission that helps drive electrically-powered implements as well as a popular feature that enables dealers to remotely monitor the condition of customer equipment in the field. 
During the year, extensive updates were made to the 
company…ïs Õëagship roZ-crop tractors, including introduction of the industry…ïs first fixed-frame four-track tractor. Enhancements to other large and mid-  
sized tractors boost comfort and performance and  
offer increased levels of innovation. A neZly launched self-propelled sprayer, equipped with a 1,600-gallon  
tanN and 132-foot carEon-fiEer Eoom, has raised the Ear for applicator productivity. In another case, an advanced roZ-crop planter for customers in South America delivers up to tZice the planting accuracy as previous models.

Meanwhile, customers have responded 
favorably to advanced products designed and built with sustainability in mind. These products apply inputs with great precision, efficiently guide equipment through the field, and offer improved fuel economy as well as greater reliance on electric  
drives. Our Blue River Technology unit continued  
with the development of sprayers that aim to dramatically reduce herbicide usage. 
SHOWING THE WAY IN RESPONSIBLE CITIZENSHIP
Wherever we operate, Deere is committed to sharing with others and being a responsible corporate citizen. During the year, the company and its foundation made charitaEle contriEutions of approximately $38 million, helping improve lives throughout the  world. These contributions focused on empowering smallholder farmers, helping local communities grow, and providing quality educational opportunities.
As in past years, Deere employees supported their 
communities through extensive volunteer efforts.  
By logging some 215,000 volunteer hours in 2019 ,  
a record, employees moved closer to the goal of 1 million volunteer hours for the period 2017 through 2022.
Deere continued its work in support of smallholder 
farmers in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. During the year, the program Zas expanded to Nigeria, where it is helping farmers in 11 villages adopt more modern agricultural practices and achieve higher living standards.
Well-known for its record of responsible citizenship, 
Deere earned further accolades in 2019 . The company again appeared in prominent listings of best employers and was recognized for having one of the world‚Äôs top-100 brands.

2019AnnualReport_InsidePages.indd   10 12/18/19   1:50 PMThe year 2019 capped an eventful decade in which  
John Deere achieved great success and took major steps to create a more dynamic business model. Over the period, the company expanded its customer base, added to its global footprint,  
and made strides in innovation and precision technologies. Net income totaled nearly $26 billion for the decade, which included nine of the ten best years for earnings in company history. Deere also completed its largest-ever acquisition with the purchase of Wirtgen Group, the world‚Äôs premier roadbuilding company. The move brought global size and scale to our construction equipment division, whose sales tripled during the decade. 
Deere also created a more tightly focused business 
lineup by shedding non-core operations and acquiring  or strengthening those that build on the company‚Äôs leadership in farm equipment and technology. Perhaps the biggest story was the emergence of precision technologies, which have brought unparalleled capabilities to our customers and are helping establish Deere as a smart industrial company. 
As proof of our success building a more resilient 
enterprise, even in the face of a three-year (2014-16) sales decline of over 30 percent, annual earnings never dipped EeloZ 1.5 Eillion. Investors profited, too: Deere stockholders realized a total return of nearly 17 percent a year for the 10-year period versus about 14 percent for the overall market. COMPANY MAKES

Nestled in the picturesque English town of Virginia 
Water, the Wentworth Club and its three world-class golf courses are steeped in history. 
Home to a top European Tour event, the BMW 
Championship, Wentworth is known for its  
commitment to nature and conservation. The club‚Äôs courses are painstakingly maintained and celebrated for their pristine condition. 
Wentworth management trusts only the finest 
equipment to care for its courses in a sustainable manner ‚Äî a key factor behind the club‚Äôs decision in 2019 to form an exclusive partnership with Deere to supply golf course maintenance equipment. Today the fleet consists of more than 140 machines ‚Äî ranging from fairway mowers to GPS precision sprayers.  
‚ÄúWe knew the environmental and sustainability aspects 
were really important to Wentworth,‚Äù said Brian D‚Äô Arcy, division sales manager. An agricultural industry leader in GPS technology, Deere also is developing systems for golf course maintenance. One example is Deere‚Äôs ProGator GPS precision sprayer. It delivers significant environmental benefits by applying inputs with great accuracy and only to predetermined target areas. Using the sprayer, Wentworth both reduced chemical use 20 percent and cut costs. 
The sprayer uses Deere‚Äôs automatic-guidance system 
to steer itself with single-inch accuracy. 
‚ÄúWe are delighted to welcome Deere to Wentworth as 
our exclusive partner in the supply of greenskeeping and grounds machinery through our dealer Farol,‚Äù said Kenny Mackay, Wentworth director of golf.  
‚ÄúThis agreement represents a significant investment to ensure our fleet is always at the forefront of technology and innovation.‚Äù

2019AnnualReport_InsidePages.indd   20 12/20/19   12:16 PMShareholder Value Added (SVA) ‚Äî essentially, the difference between operating profit and the pretax cost of capital ‚Äî is a metric 
used by John Deere to evaluate business results and measure sustainable performance. To arrive at SVA, each equipment segment is assessed a pretax cost of assets ‚Äî generally 12% of average identifiable operating assets with inventory at standard cost (believed to more closely approximate the current cost of inventory and the company‚Äôs related investment). The financial services segment is assessed a cost of average equity ‚Äî approximately 13% pretax (15% in 2017 and 2018). The amount of SVA is determined by deducting the asset or equity charge from operating profit.
Additional information on these metrics and their relationship to amounts presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP can be found at our website,  
www.JohnDeere.com/Investors. Note: Some totals may vary due to rounding.
* On December 1, 2017 , the Company acquired the stock and certain assets of substantially all of Wirtgen Group 
Holding GmbH‚Äôs operations (Wirtgen), the leading manufacturer worldwide of roadbuilding equipment. Wirtgen is included in the construction and forestry segment. Wirtgen is excluded from the metrics above.
** The 2018 SVA was adjusted for certain effects of U.S. Tax Reform legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 , due to 
the significant discrete income tax benefit in 2018. 2019 SVA is calculated with unadjusted U.S. GAAP information. To create and grow SVA, Deere equipment 
operations are targeting an operating return on average operating assets (OROA) of 20% at mid-cycle sales volumes and equally ambitious returns at other points in the cycle. (For purposes of this calculation, operating assets are average identifiable assets during the year  with inventories valued at standard cost.)SVA: FOCUSING ON GROWTH AND SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE

23 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED  
NOVEMBER 3, 2019, OCTOBER 28, 2018, AND OCTOBER 29, 2017 
OVERVIEW 
Organization 
The company‚Äôs equipment operations generate revenues and cash 
primarily from the sale of equipment to John Deere dealers and distributors. The equipment operations manufacture and 
distribute a full line of agricultural equipment; a variety of 
commercial and consumer equipment; and a broad range of equipment for construction, road building, and forestry. The company‚Äôs financial services primarily provide credit services, which mainly finance sales and leases of equipment by John Deere dealers and trade receivables purchased from the equipment 
operations. In addition, financial services offers extended 
equipment warranties. The information in the following discussion is presented in a format that includes information grouped as consolidated, equipment operations, and financial services. The company also views its operations as consisting of two geographic areas, the U.S. and Canada, and outside the U.S. and Canada. The 
company‚Äôs operating segments consist of agriculture and turf, construction and forestry, and financial services. 
T
rends and Economic Conditions 
The company‚Äôs agriculture and turf equipment sales increased 2 
percent in 2019 and are forecast to decrease 5 to 10 percent for 2020. Industry agricultural machinery sales in the U.S. and Canada 
for 2020 are forecast to decline about 5 percent, compared to 2019 . 
Industry sales in the European Union (EU)28 member nations and South American industry sales of tractors and combines are forecast to be about the same in 2020. Asian sales are also forecast to be about the same in 2020. Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be about the 
same. The company‚Äôs construction and forestry sales increased 10 
percent in 2019 . The segment‚Äôs sales are forecast to decrease 10 to 15 percent in 2020. Global forestry  industry sales are expected to 
be about the same as 2019 sales. Net income of the company‚Äôs financial services operations attributable to Deere & Company in 2020 is expected to be approximately $600 million. 
Items of concern include trade agreements, the uncertainty of the 
effectiveness of governmental actions in respect to monetary and fiscal policies, the impact of sovereign debt, Eurozone and Argentine issues, capital market disruptions, changes in demand 
and pricing for used equipment, and geopolitical events. 
Significant fluctuations in fore ign currency exchange rates and 
volatility in the price of many commodities could also impact the company‚Äôs results. 
The company‚Äôs results reflected continued uncertainties in the 
agricultural sector. Trade tens ions and difficult growing and 
harvesting conditions have caused farmers to become cautious 
about major equipment purchases. Financial services‚Äô results were also pressured by operating lease losses. The favorable general economic conditions supported demand for smaller equipment 
and led to strong sales and operating profit for the construction 
and forestry operations. Despite the present challenges, the longer-term outlook for the company‚Äôs businesses remains positive. The company believes it is well positioned to be a leader in the delivery of smarter, more efficient, and sustainable solutions. 
In addition, a series of measures to create a leaner organization 
structure have been initiated that will allow the company to 
operate with more speed and agility.

019 COMPARED WITH 2018 
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 
The following table provides the net income attributable to Deere 
& Company in millions of dollars as well as diluted and basic earnings per share in dollars: 
 2 019  2 018  
Net income attributable to Deere & Company .......   $  3,253  $  2,368

Basic earnings per share .....................................     10.28   7.34  
Net income in 2019 and 2018 was affected by discrete adjustments 
to the provision for income taxes, including those related to the 
U.S. tax reform legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 (tax reform) (see Note 9). The adjustments in 2019 related to tax reform reduced the provision for income taxes by $68 million and in 2018 
increased the provision by $704 million.  
The worldwide net sales and revenues, price realization, and the 
effect of currency translation for worldwide, U.S. and Canada, and outside U.S. and Canada in millions of dollars follows:

Financial services net income .........     539    942  -43  
The discussion on net sales and operating profit are included in the 
Business Segment and Geograph ic Area Results below. The 
equipment operations‚Äô 2019 and 2018 net income included a 
discrete income tax benefit related to tax reform of $65 million and 
expense of $1,045 million, respectively (see Note 9). Financial  
 
24 services‚Äô net income was affected by favorable income tax benefits 
related to tax reform of $3 million and $341 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Excluding the tax reform adjustments, the financial services 
segment net income decreased compared to 2018 due to impairments and higher losses on operating lease residual values and unfavorable financing spreads, partially offset by income 
earned on a higher average portfolio. Additional information is 
presented in the following discussion of the ‚ÄúWorldwide Financial Services Operations.‚Äù 
The cost of sales to net sales ratio and other significant statement 
of consolidated income changes not previously discussed in 
millions of dollars follow:

Interest expense  ...............................    1,466    1,204  +22  Other operating expenses  ................    1,578    1,399  +13  
 
The cost of sales to net sales ratio increased compared to 2018 
mainly due to higher production costs, the unfavorable effects of 
foreign currency exchange, and a less favorable product mix, partially offset by price realization. Finance and interest income increased in 2019 due to a larger average credit portfolio and higher average interest rates. Research and development expenses increased as a result of spending to support new, advanced 
products. Selling, administrative and general expenses increased 
primarily due to employee separation costs and acquisition related amortization, partially offset by the favorable effects of currency translation and lower incentive compensation. Interest expense increased in 2019 due to higher average borrowing rates and higher 
average borrowings. Other operating expenses increased in 2019 
primarily due to impairments and higher losses on operating lease 
residual values and increased depreciation of equipment on operating leases, partially offset by lower pension and postretirement benefit costs excluding the service cost component. 
The company has several funded and unfunded defined benefit 
pension plans and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans, 
primarily health care and life insurance plans. The company‚Äôs costs for these plans in 2019 were $235 million, compared with $353 million in 2018. The long-term expected return on plan assets, 
which is reflected in these costs, was an expected gain of 6.5 
percent in 2019 and 6.8 percent in 2018, or $838 million and $797 million, respectively. The actual return was a gain of $2,163 million in 2019 and $322 million in 2018. In 2020, the expected return will be approximately 6.4 percent. The company‚Äôs costs under these plans in 2020 are expected to increase approximately $75 million. The company makes any required contributions to the plan assets 
under applicable regulations and voluntary contributions after 
evaluating the company‚Äôs liquidity position and ability to make tax-deductible contributions. Total company contributions to the plans were $518 million in 2019 and $1,426 million in 2018, which included voluntary contributions and direct benefit payments. The 
voluntary contributions to plan assets were $306 million in 2019 , 
which included $300 million to a U.S. OPEB plan, and $1,305 million in 2018, which included $1,300 million to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans. Total company contributions in 2020 are expected to be approximately $525 million. The anticipated contributions include a voluntary U.S. OPEB plan contribution of $300 million. 
The remaining contributions primarily include direct benefit 
payments from company funds. The company has no significant required contributions to U.S. pension plan assets in 2020 under applicable funding regulations. See the discussion in ‚ÄúCritical Accounting Policies‚Äù for more information about pension and OPEB benefit obligations.

USINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS 
The following discussion relates to operating results by reportable 
segment and geographic area. Operating profit is income before certain external interest expense, certain foreign exchange gains or losses, income taxes, and corporate expenses. However, operating profit of the financial services segment includes the 
effect of interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains or 
losses.

orldwide Agriculture and Turf Operations 
The agriculture and turf segment results in millions of dollars 
follow: 
 2 019  2 018  %  Change  
Net sales ...........................................   $  23,666  $  23,191  +2  
Operating profit ...............................     2,506    2,816  -11  
Operating margin .............................    10.6%   12.1%    
Segment sales increased due to price realization and higher 
shipment volumes, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Operating profit decreased largely due to 
higher production costs, the unfavorable effects of currency 
exchange, increased research and development costs, higher selling, administrative, and general expenses, and a less favorable sales mix, partially offset by pric e realization and higher shipment 
volumes.

orldwide Construction and Forestry Operations 
The construction and forestry segm ent results in millions of dollars 
follow: 
 2 019  2 018  %  Change  
Net sales ...........................................   $  11,220  $  10,160  +10  
Operating profit ...............................     1,215    868  +40  
Operating margin .............................    10.8%   8.5%    
Segment sales increased in 2019 primarily due to higher shipment 
volumes and price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable 
effects of currency translation. The inclusion of Wirtgen‚Äôs sales for two additional months in 2019 accounted for about 4 percent of the sales increase. Wirtgen‚Äôs operating profit was $343 million in 2019 , compared with $116 million in the prior year. Excluding 
Wirtgen, the operating profit improvement in 2019 was primarily  
 
25 driven by price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially 
offset by higher production costs and a less favorable sales mix.  
Worldwide Financial Services Operations 
The financial services segment revenue, interest expense, and 
operating profit in millions of dollars, along with the ratio of earnings to fixed charges follow: 
 
  2 019  2 018  %  Change  
Revenue (including  
intercompany revenue) .................   $  3,969  $  3,560  +11  
Interest expense .............................     1,234    936  +32  
Operating profit ...............................     694    792  -12  Consolidated ratio of earnings to  
fixed charges .................................     1.57    1.87    
 
Operating profit in 2019 declined mainly due to impairments and 
higher losses on operating lease residual values and unfavorable 
financing spreads, partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio. The average balance of receivables and leases financed was 8 percent higher in 2019 , compared with 2018. Interest expense increased in 2019 as a result of higher average 
borrowing rates and higher average borrowings. 
E
quipment Operations in U.S. and Canada 
The equipment operations in th e U.S. and Canada results in 
millions of dollars follow: 
 
  2 019  2 018  %  Change

Operating profit ...............................     2,335    2,356  -1  
Operating margin .............................    11.5%   12.5%    
 
The operating profit decrease was due primarily to higher 
production costs, a less favorable sales mix, increased research and development expenses, and higher selling, administrative, and general expenses. The decline was largely offset by price 
realization and higher shipment volumes. Net sales increased in 
2019 due primarily to price realization and higher shipment volumes. The physical volume of sales, excluding the effect of acquisitions, increased 4 percent, compared with 2018. 
E
quipment Operations outside U.S. and Canada 
The equipment operations outside the U.S. and Canada results in

Operating profit ...............................     1,386    1,328  +4  
Operating margin .............................    9.5%   9.2%    
 
Operating profit increased primarily due to price realization and 
higher shipment volumes, partially offset by higher production 
costs, the unfavorable effects of currency exchange, increased research and development expenses, and higher selling, administrative, and general expenses. Net sales increased 1 percent in 2019 , with Wirtgen adding 3 percent, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily the result of the Wirtgen acquisition and 
price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of 
currency translation. The physical volume of sales, excluding the effect of acquisitions, was the same as 2018. M
ARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK 
Net income attributable to Deere & Company for fiscal 2020 is forecast to be in a range of $2,700 million to $3,100 million. 
During the first quarter of 2020, the company announced a 
broad voluntary employee-separation program. The program‚Äôs total pretax expenses are estimated to be about $140 million with annual savings of about $115 million (see Note 31). 
A
griculture and Turf. The company‚Äôs worldwide sales of agriculture 
and turf equipment are forecast to decline about 5 to 10 percent 
for fiscal year 2020, including price realization of 2 percent and a 
negative currency translation effect of 1 percent. Industry sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to decrease about 5 percent, driven by lower demand for large equipment. Full year industry sales in the EU28 member nations are forecast to be about the same as 2019 as are South American 
industry sales of tractors and combines. Asian sales are forecast to 
be about the same as 2019 . Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be about the same for 2020. 
C
onstruction and Forestry. The company‚Äôs worldwide sales of 
construction and forestry equipment are anticipated to decrease 
about 10 to 15 percent for 2020, with price realization having a 
favorable effect of 1 percent and foreign currency translation having an unfavorable effect of 1 percent. The outlook reflects slowing construction activity as well as the company‚Äôs efforts to assist dealers to manage their inventory levels. In forestry, global industry sales are expected to  be about the same as 2019 . 
F
inancial Services. Fiscal year 2020 net income attributable to 
Deere & Company for the financial services operations is expected to be approximately $600 million. Net income is expected to benefit from lower losses on lease re sidual values as well as income 
earned on a higher average portfolio. These items are forecast to be partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses, less 
favorable financing spreads, and higher selling and administrative 
expenses.

AFE HARBOR STATEMENT 
Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation 
Reform Act of 1995: Statements under ‚ÄúOverview,‚Äù ‚ÄúMarket 
Conditions and Outlook,‚Äù and other forward-looking statements 
herein that relate to future events, expectations, and trends 
involve factors that are subject to change, and risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the company‚Äôs businesses. 
The company‚Äôs agricultural equipment business is subject to a 
number of uncertainties including the factors that affect farmers‚Äô confidence and financial condition. These factors include demand for agricultural products, world grain stocks, weather conditions, 
soil conditions, harvest yields, prices for commodities and 
livestock, crop and livestock production expenses, availability of transport for crops, trade restrictions and tariffs (e.g., China), global trade agreements (e.g., the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), the level of farm product exports (including concerns  
 
26 about genetically modified organisms), the growth and 
sustainability of non-food uses for some crops (including ethanol and biodiesel production), real estate values, available acreage for 
farming, the land ownership policies of governments, changes in 
government farm programs and policies, international reaction to such programs, changes in and effects of crop insurance programs, changes in environmental regulations and their impact on farming practices, animal diseases (e.g., African swine fever) and their effects on poultry, beef and pork consumption and prices and on 
livestock feed demand, and crop pests and diseases. 
Factors affecting the outlook for the company‚Äôs turf and utility 
equipment include consumer confidence, weather conditions, customer profitability, labor supply, consumer borrowing patterns, 
consumer purchasing preferences, housing starts and supply, 
infrastructure investment, spending by municipalities and golf courses, and consumable input costs. 
Consumer spending patterns, real estate and housing prices, the 
number of housing starts, interest rates and the levels of public 
and non-residential construction are important to sales and results of the company‚Äôs construction and forestry equipment. Prices for pulp, paper, lumber and structural panels are important to sales of forestry equipment. 
All of the company‚Äôs businesses and its results are affected by 
general economic conditions in the global markets and industries 
in which the company operates; customer confidence in general economic conditions; government spending and taxing; foreign currency exchange rates and their vo latility, especially fluctuations 
in the value of the U.S. dollar; interest rates (including the availability of IBOR reference rates); inflation and deflation rates; changes in weather patterns; the political and social stability of the global markets in which the company operates; the effects of, or response to, terrorism and security threats; wars and other conflicts; natural disasters; and the spread of major epidemics. 
Significant changes in market liqu idity conditions, changes in the 
company‚Äôs credit ratings and any fa ilure to comply with financial 
covenants in credit agreements could impact access to funding 
and funding costs, which could reduce the company‚Äôs earnings and 
cash flows. Financial market conditions could also negatively 
impact customer access to capital for purchases of the company‚Äôs products and customer confidence and purchase decisions, borrowing and repayment practices, and the number and size of customer loan delinquencies and defaults. A debt crisis, in Europe or elsewhere, could negatively impact currencies, global financial 
markets, social and political stability, funding sources and costs, 
asset and obligation values, cust omers, suppliers, demand for 
equipment, and company operations and results. The company‚Äôs investment management activities could be impaired by changes in the equity, bond and other financial markets, which would negatively affect earnings. 
The anticipated withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the 
European Union and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere. The economic conditions and outlook could be further adversely affected by (i) the uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the exit, (ii) new or modified trading 
arrangements between the United Kingdom and other countries, 
(iii) the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union, or (iv) the risk that the euro as th e single currency of the Eurozone 
could cease to exist. Any of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur, could affect 
economic growth or business activity in the United Kingdom or the 
European Union, and could result in the relocation of businesses, cause business interruptions, lead to economic recession or depression, and impact the stability of the financial markets, availability of credit, currency exchange rates, interest rates, financial institutions, and political, financial and monetary 
systems. Any of these developments could affect our businesses, 
liquidity, results of operations and financial position. 
Additional factors that could materially affect the company‚Äôs 
operations, access to capital, expenses and results include changes 
in, uncertainty surrounding and the impact of governmental trade, 
banking, monetary and fiscal policies, including financial regulatory reform and its effects on the consumer finance industry, derivatives, funding costs and other areas, and governmental programs, policies, tariffs and sanctions in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of certain industries or sectors; 
retaliatory actions to such changes in trade, banking, monetary 
and fiscal policies; actions by central banks; actions by financial and securities regulators; actions by environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies, including those related to engine emissions, carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, noise and the effects of climate change; changes to GPS radio frequency 
bands or their permitted uses; changes in labor and immigration 
regulations; changes to accounting standards; changes in tax rates, estimates, laws and regulations and company actions related thereto; changes to and compliance with privacy regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign laws when expanding to new markets and otherwise; and actions by other regulatory bodies. 
Other factors that could materially affect results include 
production, design and technological innovations and difficulties, including capacity and supply constraints and prices; the loss of or challenges to intellectual property rights whether through theft, 
infringement, counterfeiting or otherwise; the availability and 
prices of strategically sourced materials, components and whole goods; delays or disruptions in the company‚Äôs supply chain or the loss of liquidity by suppliers; disruptions of infrastructures that support communications, operations or distribution; the failure of suppliers or the company to comply with laws, regulations and 
company policy pertaining to employment, human rights, health, 
safety, the environment, anti-corruption, privacy and data protection and other ethical business practices; events that damage the company‚Äôs reputation or brand; significant investigations, claims, lawsuits or other legal proceedings; start-up of new plants and products; the success of new product initiatives; 
changes in customer product pref erences and sales mix; gaps or 
limitations in rural broadband coverage, capacity and speed  
 
27 needed to support technology so lutions; oil and energy prices, 
supplies and volatility; the availability and cost of freight; actions 
of competitors in the various industries in which the company 
competes, particularly price discount ing; dealer practices especially 
as to levels of new and used field inventories; changes in demand 
and pricing for used equipment and resulting impacts on lease residual values; labor relations and contracts; changes in the ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel; acquisitions and divestitures of businesses; greater than anticipated transaction 
costs; the integration of new businesses; the failure or delay in 
closing or realizing anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures; the implementation of organizational changes; the failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits of cost reduction, productivity, or efficiency efforts; difficulties related to the conversion and implementation of enterprise 
resource planning systems; security breaches, cybersecurity 
attacks, technology failures and other disruptions to the company‚Äôs and suppliers‚Äô information technology infrastructure; changes in company declared dividends and common stock issuances and repurchases; change s in the level and funding of 
employee retirement benefits; changes in market values of 
investment assets, compensation, retirement, discount and 
mortality rates which impact retirement benefit costs; and significant changes in health care costs. 
The liquidity and ongoing profitability of John Deere Capital 
Corporation and other credit subsidiaries depend largely on timely 
access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements, and to fund operations, costs, and purchases of the company‚Äôs products. If general economic conditions deteriorate or capital markets become more volatile, funding could be unavailable or insufficient. Additionally, customer confidence levels may result in 
declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and 
default rates, which could materially impact write-offs and provisions for credit losses. 
The company‚Äôs outlook is based upon assumptions relating to the 
factors described above, which are sometimes based upon 
estimates and data prepared by government agencies. Such estimates and data are often revised. The company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise its outlook, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Further information concerning the company and its businesses, 
including factors that could materially affect the company‚Äôs 
financial results, is included in the company‚Äôs other filings with the SEC.

2018 Form 10-K. 
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
The discussion of capital resources and liquidity has been 
organized to review separately, where appropriate, the company‚Äôs consolidated totals, equipment operations, and financial services 
operations. C
ONSOLIDATED 
Positive cash flows from consolidated operating activities in 2019 
were $3,412 million. This resulted primarily from net income 
adjusted for non-cash provisions and a change in accrued income 
taxes payable/receivable, which were partially offset by an increase in receivables related to sales, an increase in inventories after adjusting for equipment transferred to operating leases (see Note 7) and the disposition of the construction and forestry retail locations in Canada (see Note 4), and a change in net retirement 
benefits (see Note 8). Cash outflows from investing activities were 
$3,924 million in 2019 , due primarily to the cost of receivables (excluding receivables related to sales) and cost of equipment on operating leases acquired exceeding the collections of receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $2,848 million, purchases of property and equipment of $1,120 
million, and purchases of marketable securities exceeding proceeds 
from maturities and sales by $51 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales of business es and unconsolidated affiliates, 
net of cash sold, of $93 million (see Note 4). Cash inflows from financing activities were $509 million in 2019 , due primarily to an increase in borrowings of $2,643 million and proceeds from 
issuance of common stock (resulting from the exercise of stock 
options) of $178 million, partially offset by repurchases of common stock of $1,253 million and dividends paid of $943 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased $59 million during 201 9.  
Over the last three years, operating activities have provided an 
aggregate of $7 ,430 million in cash. In addition, increases in 
borrowings were $9 ,774 million, proceeds from issuance of common stock (resulting from the exercise of stock options) were $924 million, proceeds from sales of businesses and 
unconsolidated affiliates were $363 million, and proceeds from 
maturities and sales exceeded purchases of marketable securities by $178 million. The aggregate amount of these cash flows was used mainly to acquire receivables (excluding receivables related to sales) and equipment on operating leases that exceeded collections of receivables and the proceeds from sales of 
equipment on operating leases by $5,950 million, acquire 
businesses of $5,529 million, purchase property and equipment of $2,611 million, pay dividends of $2,513 million, and repurchase common stock of $2,217 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased $534 million over the three-year period. 
The company has access to most global capital markets at 
reasonable costs and expects to have sufficient sources of global 
funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs. Sources of liquidity for the company include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds from operations, the issuance of 
commercial paper and term debt, the securitization of retail notes 
(both public and private markets), and committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit. The company‚Äôs commercial paper outstanding at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 was $2,698 million and $3,857 million, respectively, while the total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities position was 
$4,438 million and $4,394 million, respectively. The amount of the 
total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by  
 
28 foreign subsidiaries was $2,731 million and $2,433 million at 
November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively. 
Lines of Credit. The company also has access to bank lines of credit 
with various banks throughout the world. Worldwide lines of credit 
totaled $8,499 million at November 3, 2019 , $5,143 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper, and short-term bank borrowings, 
excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-
term borrowings, were primarily considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at November 3, 2019 was a 364-day credit facility agreement of $2,800 million, expiring in fiscal April 2020. In addition, total credit lines included long-term credit facility agreements of $2,500 million, expiring in April 2023, 
and $2,500 million, expiring in  April 2024. The agreements are 
mutually extendable and the annual facility fees are not significant. 
These credit agreements require John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to 
capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder‚Äôs equity 
excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreements also require the equipment operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total debt and stockholders‚Äô equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) 
of 65 percent or less at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this 
provision, the company‚Äôs excess equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of restriction at November 3, 2019 was $13,554 million. Alternatively under this provision, the equipment operations had the capacity to incur additional debt of $25,171 million at November 3, 2019 . All of these credit agreement 
requirements have been met during the periods included in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Debt Ratings. To access public debt capital markets, the company 
relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term 
credit ratings to the company‚Äôs securities as an indicator of credit 
quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold company securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw company ratings based on its assessment of the company‚Äôs current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment 
obligations. Each agency‚Äôs rating should be evaluated 
independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets. 
The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook 
currently assigned to unsecured company securities by the rating 
agencies engaged by the company are as follows: 
 
       
   Senior         
  Long-Term  Short-Term  Outlook

Moody‚Äôs Investors Service, Inc. ..........    A2   Prime-1   Stable Standard & Poor‚Äôs ...............................    A   A-1   Stable 
 Trade accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales of 
goods to independent dealers. Trade receivables increased by $226 million in 2019 due primarily to higher shipment volumes, partially 
offset by foreign currency translation. The ratio of trade accounts 
and notes receivable at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 to fiscal year net sales was 15 percent in both 2019 and 2018. Total worldwide agriculture and turf receivables increased $14 million and construction and forestry receivables increased $212 million. The collection period for trade receivables averages less than 12 
months. The percentage of trade receivables outstanding for a 
period exceeding 12 months was 3 percent at November 3, 2019 and 2 percent at October 28, 2018. 
Deere & Company‚Äôs stockholders‚Äô equity was $11,413 million at 
November 3, 2019 , compared with $11,288 million at October 28, 
2018. The increase of $125 million resulted from net income attributable to Deere & Company of $3,253 million and an increase in common stock of $168 million, which were partially offset by an increase in treasury stock of $1,162 million, dividends declared of $963 million, a change in the retirement benefits adjustment of 
$678 million, a change in the cumulative translation adjustment of 
$448 million, and an unrealized loss on derivatives of $75 million. 
E
QUIPMENT OPERATIONS 
The company‚Äôs equipment businesses are capital intensive and are 
subject to seasonal variations in financing requirements for inventories and certain receivables from dealers. The equipment 
operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to 
financial services. T o the extent necessary, funds provided from operations are supplemented by external financing sources. 
Cash provided by operating activities of the equipment operations 
during 2019 , including intercompany cash flows, was $3,200 million 
due primarily to net income adjusted for non-cash provisions, partially offset by a change in accrued income taxes payable/receivable, a change in net retirement benefits (see Note 8), an increase in trade receivables and Equipment Operations‚Äô financing receivables, and an increase in inventories after adjusting 
for the Canada retail locations disposition (see Note 4) and foreign 
currency translation. 
Over the last three years, these operating activities, including 
intercompany cash flows, have provided an aggregate of $8,915 
million in cash. 
Trade receivables held by the equipment operations increased by 
$108 million during 2019 . The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services 
(see previous consolidated discussion). 
Inventories decreased by $174 million in 2019 due primarily to the 
Canada retail locations disposition (see Note 4) and the effect of foreign currency translation. Most of these inventories are valued 
on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The ratios of inventories on 
a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis (see Note 16), which approximates current cost, to fiscal year cost of sales were 29 percent and 30 percent at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively. 
Total interest-bearing debt of the equipment operations was 
$6,446 million at the end of 2019 , compared with $6,223 million at  
 
29 the end of 2018 and $5,866 million at the end of 2017 . The ratio of 
total debt to total capital (total interest-bearing debt and stockholders‚Äô equity) at the end of 2019 , 2018, and 2017 was 36 
percent, 36 percent, and 38 percent, respectively. 
The company may from time to time seek to retire portions of its 
outstanding debt securities through cash repurchases or exchanges for other securities, in open-market purchases, privately 
negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases or 
exchanges, if any, will be subject to and depend on prevailing market conditions, the company‚Äôs liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. 
Property and equipment cash expenditures for the equipment 
operations in 2019 were $1,118 million, compared with $893 million in 2018. Capital expenditures in 2020 are estimated to be approximately $1,100 million. 
In October 2019 , the company entered into a definitive agreement 
to acquire Unimil, a privately held Brazilian company in the aftermarket service parts business for sugarcane harvesters. The expected cash purchase price is R$375 million (or approximately 
US$95 million based on the exchange rate at the end of the fiscal 
year). The company expects to fund the acquisition and the transaction expenses with current cash. The transaction requires customary regulatory approval and is expected to close in six to ten months. 
F
INANCIAL SERVICES 
The financial services operations rely on their ability to raise 
substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios. Their primary sources of funds for this purpose are a combination of commercial paper, term debt, securitization of retail notes, equity capital, and borrowings from Deere & Company. 
The cash provided by operating and financing activities was used 
for investing activities. Cash flows from the financial services‚Äô 
operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, were $2,418 million in 2019 . Cash used by investing activities totaled $4,721 million in 2019 due primarily to the cost of receivables 
(excluding trade and wholesale) and cost of equipment on 
operating leases acquired exceeding collections of these receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $3,729 million, an increase in trade receivables and wholesale notes of $935 million, and purchases of marketable securities exceeding proceeds from maturities and sales by $60 
million. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $2,264 million 
in 2019 , representing primarily an increase in external borrowings 
of $2,416 million and an increase in borrowings from Deere & Company of $305 million, partially offset by dividends paid to Deere & Company of $427 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased $53 million. 
Over the last three years, the operating activities, including 
intercompany cash flows, have provided $5,937 million in cash. In addition, an increase in total borrowings of $7 ,351 million provided cash inflows. These amounts have been used mainly to fund receivables (excluding trade and wholesale) and equipment on operating lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases, by $9 ,677 
million, fund an increase in trade and wholesale receivables of 
$2,537 million, pay dividends to Deere & Company of $1,256 million, and purchase $140 million of marketable securities in excess of maturities and sales. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased $579 million over the three-year period. 
Receivables and equipment on operating leases increased by $3,211 
million in 2019 , compared with 2018. Total acquisition volumes of 
receivables (excluding trade and wholesale) and cost of equipment on operating leases increased 7 percent in 2019 , compared with 2018. The volumes of retail notes, revolving charge accounts, 
financing leases, and operating leases increased approximately 10 
percent, 6 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent, respectively. During 2019 , the amount of wholesal e notes and trade receivables 
increased 17 percent and 3 percent, respectively. At November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, net receivables and leases administered, which include receivables administered but not 
owned, were $46,194 million and $42,985 million, respectively. 
Total external interest-bearing debt of the financial services 
operations was $38,888 million at the end of 2019 , compared with $36,033 million at the end of 2018 and $34,179 million at the end of 
2017 . Total external borrowings have changed generally 
corresponding with the level of the receivable and lease portfolio, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in payables owed to Deere & Company, and the change in investment from Deere & Company. The financial services operations‚Äô ratio of total interest-bearing debt to total stockholder‚Äôs equity was 8.0 to 1 at 
the end of 2019 , 7 .5 to 1 at the end of 2018, and 7 .6 to 1 at the end of 
20 1 7.  
The Capital Corporation has a revolving credit agreement to utilize 
bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 14). At 
November 3, 2019 , the facility had a total capacity, or ‚Äúfinancing 
limit,‚Äù of up to $3,500 million of secured financings at any time. The facility was renewed in November 2019 with a capacity of $3,500 million. After a two-year revolving period, unless the banks and Capital Corporation agree to renew, Capital Corporation would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the 
retail notes are collected. At November 3, 2019, $1,434 million of 
short-term securitization borrowings was outstanding under the agreement. 
During 2019 , the financial services operations issued $3,310 million 
and retired $2,914 million of retail note securitization borrowings. 
During 2019 , the financial services operations also issued $8,638 million and retired $5,454 million of long-term borrowings, which were primarily medium-term notes. 
O
FF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
At November 3, 2019 , the company had approximately $343 million 
of guarantees issued primarily to banks outside the U.S. and Canada related to third-party receivables for the retail financing of John Deere and Wirtgen equipment. The company may recover a portion of any required payments incurred under these  
 
30 agreements from repossession of the equipment collateralizing the 
receivables. The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at November 3, 2019 was approximately seven years.

respectively. 
C
RITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The preparation of the company‚Äôs consolidated financial 
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
revenues, and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements. The accounting policies below are those management believes are the most critical to the preparation of the company‚Äôs financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective, or 
complex judgments. The company‚Äôs other accounting policies are 
described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
S
ales Incentives 
At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the company records an 
estimate of the future sales incentive costs as a reduction to the sales price. These incentives may be based on a dealer‚Äôs purchase 
volume, or on retail sales incentive programs for allowances and 
financing programs that will be due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimated cost of these programs is based on historical data, announced and expected incentive programs, field inventory levels, and forecasted sales volumes. The final cost of these programs is determined at the end of the measurement period for volume-based incentives or when the dealer sells the equipment to the retail customer. This is due to 
numerous programs available at any particular time and new 
programs that may be announced after the company records the equipment sale. Changes in the mix and types of programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly. 
The sales incentive accruals at November 3, 2019 , October 28, 2018, 
and October 29 , 2017 were $2,033 million, $1,850 million, and $1,581 
million, respectively. The total accrual is recorded $1,443 million, $1,297 million, and $1,089 million in trade accounts and notes receivable ‚Äì net, and $590 million, $553 million, and $492 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses at November 3, 2019 , 
October 28, 2018, and October 29 , 2017 , respectively. The increases 
in 2019 and 2018 were related primarily to higher sales volume.  
The estimation of the retail sales incentive accrual is impacted by 
many assumptions. One of the key assumptions is the predictive 
value of the historical percent of retail sales incentive costs to retail 
sales from dealers. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus 1.1 percent, compared to the average retail sales incentive costs to retail sales percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated retail incentive cost experience percent were to 
increase or decrease 1.1 percent, the sales incentive accrual at 
November 3, 2019 would increase or decrease by approximately $94 million. 
P
roduct Warranties 
At the time a sale is recognized, the company records the 
estimated future warranty costs. The company generally 
determines its total warranty liability by applying historical claims 
rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and consideration of current quality developments. Variances in claims experience and the type 
of warranty programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly. 
The product warranty accruals, excluding extended warranty 
unamortized premiums, at November 3, 2019 , October 28, 2018, and 
October 29 , 2017 were $1,218 million, $1,146 million, and $1,007 
million, respectively. The increases in 2019 and 2018 were related primarily to higher sales volume. 
Estimates used to determine the product warranty accruals are 
significantly affected by the historical percent of warranty claims 
costs to sales. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .09 percent, compared to the average warranty costs to sales percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience percent were to increase or decrease .09 percent, 
the warranty accrual at November 3, 2019 would increase or 
decrease by approximately $40 million.  
 
31 Postretirement Benefit Obligations 
Pension and other postretirement benefit, primarily health care 
and life insurance plans, obligations are based on various 
assumptions used by the company‚Äôs actuaries in calculating these 
amounts. These assumptions includ e discount rates, health care 
cost trend rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement rates, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions affect future expenses and obligations. 
The pension liabilities, net of pe nsion assets, recognized on the 
balance sheet at November 3, 2019 were $226 million. The pension 
assets, net of pension liabilities, recognized on the balance sheet at October 28, 2018 were $494 million. The pension liabilities, net 
of pension assets, recognized on the balance sheet at October 29 , 
2017 were $1,073 million. The increase in pension net liabilities in 2019 was due primarily to decreases in discount rates and interest on the liabilities, largely offset by the return on plan assets. The increase in pension net assets in 2018 was due primarily to increases in discount rates and cont ributions to a U.S. pension plan 
(see Note 8), partially offset by interest on the liabilities. The OPEB liabilities, net of OPEB assets, at November 3, 2019 , October 28, 2018, and October 29 , 2017 were $4,686 million, $4,753 million, and $5,623 million, respectively. The decrease in OPEB net liabilities in 2019 was due primarily to contributions to a U.S. OPEB plan, a decrease in health care trend rates, and company contributions for 
benefit payments, mostly offset by decreases in discount rates. 
The decrease in OPEB net liabilities in 2018 was due primarily to increases in discount rates and contributions to the U.S. OPEB 
plans (see Note 8). 
The effect of hypothetical changes to selected assumptions on the 
company‚Äôs major U.S. retirement benefit plans would be as follows 
in millions of dollars:

or losses. 
 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually 
and when events or circumstances change such that it is more 
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is reduced 
below its carrying amount. The end of the fiscal third quarter is the annual measurement date. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of th e goodwill is considered impaired, 
a loss is measured as the excess of the reporting unit‚Äôs carrying value over the fair value, with a limit of the goodwill allocated to 
that reporting unit. 
An estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is determined 
through a combination of comparable market values for similar businesses and discounted cash fl ows. These estimates can change 
significantly based on such factors as the reporting unit‚Äôs financial performance, economic conditions, interest rates, growth rates, pricing, changes in business strategies, and competition. 
Based on this testing, the company has not identified a reporting 
unit for which the goodwill was impaired in 2019 , 2018, or 2017 . For 
all reporting units, a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value would have had no effect on the carrying value of goodwill at the annual measurement date in 2019 . 
A
llowance for Credit Losses 
The allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the losses 
inherent in the company‚Äôs receivab le portfolio. The level of the 
allowance is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, 
including historical net loss experience by finance product category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions in the company‚Äôs major markets and geographies, commodity price trends, and credit risk quality. The company has 
an established process to calculate a range of possible outcomes 
and determine the adequacy of the allowance. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly by finance product category. Different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses. 
The total allowance for credit losses at November 3, 2019 , October 
28, 2018, and October 29 , 2017 was $222 million, $248 million, and $243 million, respectively. The allowance decrease in 2019 was mainly due to continued improvement in credit loss experience in 
certain foreign markets. The allowance increase in 2018 was due 
primarily to growth in the receivable portfolio. 
The assumptions used in evaluating the company‚Äôs exposure to 
credit losses involve estimates and significant judgment. The 
historical loss experience on the receivable portfolio represents 
one factor used in determining the allowance for credit losses. Compared to the average loss experience over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .04 percent, compared to the average loss experience percent during that period. Holding other factors constant, if this 
estimated loss experience on the receivable portfolio were to 
increase or decrease .04 percent, the allowance for credit losses at November 3, 2019 would increase or decrease by approximately $14 million. 
O
perating Lease Residual Values 
The carrying value of equipment on operating leases is affected by 
the estimated fair values of the equipment at the end of the lease 
(residual values). Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case the company may record a gain or a loss for the difference  
 
32 between the estimated residual value and the sale price. The 
residual values are dependent on current economic conditions and are reviewed when events or circumstances necessitate an 
evaluation. Changes in residual value assumptions would affect the 
amount of depreciation expense and the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases. 
The total operating lease residual values at
 November 3, 2019 , 
October 28, 2018, and October 29 , 2017 were $5,259 million, $5,089 
million, and $4,679 million, respectively. The changes in 2019 and 2018 were due primarily to the increasing levels of operating leases. 
Estimates used in determining end of lease market values for 
equipment on operating leases significantly impact the amount 
and timing of depreciation expense. Hypothetically, if future market values for this equipment were to decrease 10 percent from the company‚Äôs present estimates, the total effect would be to increase the company‚Äôs annual depreciation for equipment on operating leases by approximately $175 million. 
I
ncome Taxes 
The company‚Äôs income tax provision, deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities, and liabilities for uncertain tax benefits represent the company‚Äôs best estimate of current and future income taxes to be paid. The annual tax rate is based on income tax laws, statutory tax rates, taxable income levels, and tax planning opportunities 
available in various jurisdictions where the company operates. 
These tax laws are complex, and require significant judgment to determine the consolidated provisio n for income taxes. Changes in 
tax laws, regulations, statutory tax rates, and estimates of the company‚Äôs future taxable income levels could result in actual realization of deferred taxes being materially different from 
amounts provided for in the consolidated financial statements. 
Deferred income taxes represent temporary differences between 
the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. 
Deferred tax assets also include loss carryforwards and tax credits. 
These assets are regularly assessed for the likelihood of recoverability from estimated future taxable income, reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies. To the extent the company determines that it is more likely than not a deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is 
established. The recoverability analysis of the deferred income tax 
assets and the related valuation allowances requires significant judgment and relies on estimates. 
Uncertain tax positions are determined based on whether it is 
more likely than not the tax positions will be sustained based on 
the technical merits of the position. For those positions that meet the more likely than not criteria, an estimate of the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority is recognized. The ultimate resolution of the tax position could take 
many years and result in a payment that is significantly different 
from the original estimate. Tax reform included additional requirements effective for the company in 2019 . Those provisions include a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), a tax determined by base 
erosion and anti-abuse tax benefits (BEAT) from certain payments 
between a U.S. corporation and foreign subsidiaries, a limitation of certain executive compensation, a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (FDII), and interest expense limitations. These provisions require interpretation and the use of estimates to determine the liability and benefits. The company‚Äôs accounting 
policy election is to treat the taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in 
taxable income under GILTI as a period cost when incurred. 
A provision for foreign withholding taxes has not been recorded on 
undistributed profits of the company‚Äôs non-U.S. subsidiaries that 
are determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If 
management intentions change in the future, there may be a significant impact on the provision for income taxes in the period the change occurs. For further information on income taxes, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. 
F
INANCIAL INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK INFORMATION 
The company is naturally exposed to various interest rate and 
foreign currency risks. As a result, the company enters into derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures that arise in the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The company‚Äôs financial 
services operations manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations while responding to favorable financing opportunities. In addition, the company has interest rate exposure at certain equipment operations units for below market 
retail financing programs that are used as sales incentives and are 
offered for extended periods. Accordingly, from time to time, these operations enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage their interest rate exposure. The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling, and financing in currencies other than 
the functional currencies. The company has entered into 
agreements related to the management of these foreign currency transaction risks. 
I
nterest Rate Risk 
Quarterly, the company uses a combination of cash flow models to 
assess the sensitivity of its financial instruments with interest rate 
exposure to changes in market interest rates. The models calculate 
the effect of adjusting interest rates as follows: cash flows for financing receivables are discounted at the current prevailing rate for each receivable portfolio, cash flows for marketable securities are primarily discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve 
plus market credit spreads, cash flows for unsecured borrowings 
are discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market 
credit spreads for similarly rated borrowers, cash flows for securitized borrowings are discounted at the swap yield curve plus a market credit spread for similarly rated borrowers, and cash flows for interest rate swaps are projected and discounted using forward rates from the swap yield curve at the repricing dates. The net loss  
 
33 in these financial instruments‚Äô fair values which would be caused 
by increasing the interest rates by 10 percent from the market rates at November 3, 2019 would have been approximately $22 million. 
The net loss from decreasing the interest rates by 10 percent at 
October 28, 2018 would have been approximately $21 million. 
F
oreign Currency Risk 
In the equipment operations, the company‚Äôs practice is to hedge 
significant currency exposures. Worldwide foreign currency exposures are reviewed quarterly. Based on the equipment 
operations‚Äô anticipated and committed foreign currency cash 
inflows, outflows, and hedging policy for the next twelve months, the company estimates that a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies through 2020 would decrease the 2020 expected net cash inflows by approximately $11 million. At October 28, 2018, a hypothetical 10 percent 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar under similar assumptions and 
calculations indicated a potential $55 million adverse effect on the 2019 net cash inflows. In the financial services operations, the company‚Äôs policy is to hedge the foreign currency risk if the currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of the receivable portfolio. As a 
result, a hypothetical 10 percent ad verse change in the value of the 
U.S. dollar relative to all other foreign currencies would not have a 
material effect on the financial services cash flows.  
34 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT  
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Deere & 
Company: 
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
of Deere & Company and subsidia ries (the "Company") as of 
November 3, 2019 and October 28 , 2018, the related statements 
of consolidated income, consolidated comprehensive income, 
changes in consolidated stockhol ders' equity, and consolidated 
cash flows for each of the th ree years in the period ended 
November 3, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to 
as the "financial statements‚Äù) . In our opinion, the financial 
statements present fair ly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Company as of November 3, 2019, and October 
28, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for 
each of the three years in the pe riod ended November 3, 2019, in 
conformity with accounting princi ples generally accepted in the 
United States of America. 
We have also audited, in accord ance with the standards of the 
Public Company Accounting Ov ersight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting 
as of November 3, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control ‚Äî Integrated Framework (2 013) issued by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organizations of  the Treadway Commission and 
our report dated December 19, 20 19, expressed an unqualified 
opinion on the Company's inte rnal control over financial 
reporting. 
Basis for Opinion  
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the 
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to 
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion. C
ritical Audit Matters  
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit 
committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are 
material to the financial statements  and (2) involved our especially 
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, 
providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the 
accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
S
ales Incentives ‚Äî Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements 
Critical Audit Matter Description The sales incentive accrual at November 3, 2019 was $2,033 million, 
of which $1,443 million is recorded within trade accounts and notes receivable ‚Äì net and $590 million is recorded within accounts payable and accrued expenses. At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the Company records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs as a reduction to the sales price. These incentives 
may be based on a dealer‚Äôs purchase volume, or on retail sales 
incentive programs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimated cost of these programs is based on historical data, announced and expected incentive programs, field inventory levels and forecasted sales volumes. The final cost of these programs is 
determined at the end of the measurement period for volume-
based incentives or when the dealer sells the equipment to the retail customer. This is due to numerous programs available at any particular time and new programs that may be announced after the company records the equipment sale. Changes in the mix and types of programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed 
quarterly. The estimation of the sales incentive accrual is impacted 
by many assumptions. One of the key assumptions is the predictive value of the historical percentage of sales incentive costs to retail sales from dealers. 
We identified the sales incentive accrual as a critical audit matter 
because estimating sales incentive costs requires significant judgment by management and changes in historical percentage of sales incentive costs to retails sales from dealers could have a 
material impact on the sales incentive accrual. Auditing 
management‚Äôs assumptions about the predictive nature of historical sales incentive costs involves a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort to evaluate the reasonableness of management‚Äôs estimates. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to testing management‚Äôs assumption 
that historical sales incentive costs are predictive of future incentive costs included the following, among others: 
‚Ä¢ We tested the effectiveness of management‚Äôs controls over the 
assumptions used to estimate the sales incentive accrual. 
‚Ä¢ We evaluated management‚Äôs ability to accurately forecast 
future incentive costs performing a retrospective review that  
35 involved comparing actual incentive costs to management‚Äôs 
historical forecasts. 
‚Ä¢ We evaluated the reasonableness of management‚Äôs assumption that historical sales incentive costs are predictive of future incentive costs by: 
‚Ä¢ Considering the impact of changes in the current economic conditions and competitive environment. 
‚Ä¢ Testing the completeness of the population used in the calculation by inspecting a sample of incentive program communications to dealers to ensure all sales incentive programs offered were included in the calculation and by confirming sales incentive payments with a sample of dealers. 
‚Ä¢ Comparing historical and current sales incentive costs in the following manner: 
‚Ä¢ Type and number of programs 
‚Ä¢ Geography 
‚Ä¢ Program size and duration 
‚Ä¢ Eligible products 
A
llowance for Credit Losses ‚Äì Refer to Notes 2 and 13 to the 
financial statements  
Critical Audit Matter Description 
The allowance for credit losses as of November 3, 2019 was $222 
million. The allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the losses inherent in the Company‚Äôs receivable portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical net loss experience by product 
category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic 
conditions in the Company‚Äôs major markets and geographies, commodity price trends, and credit risk quality. The Company has an established process to calculate a range of possible outcomes and determine the adequacy of the allowance. Historical receivable write-offs and recoveries are considered as part of the loss 
experience by product category. The adequacy of the allowance is 
assessed quarterly. 
The allowance for credit losses specific to the revolving charge 
accounts portfolio of $3,943 million as of November 3, 2019 was $40 million. The assumptions used in evaluating the Company‚Äôs exposure to revolving credit losses involve estimates and require significant judgments, as no single statistic, measurement or assumption determines the adequacy of the allowance for credit 
losses for the revolving charge accounts portfolio. Additionally, the 
revolving charge accounts portfolio is more susceptible to losses as the loans within this portfolio are unsecured. Losses in this 
portfolio are expected to follow poor economic conditions prior to losses in the other portfolios. Losses in the revolving charge accounts portfolio could grow to material levels before the full 
extent of losses is observable in the historical loss data. Therefore, 
historical loss experience is not the sole predicting factor of anticipated losses. Consequently, qualitative factors (which consider overall economic conditions, the agricultural market, commodity price trends, and delinquency trends) are considered when adjusting historical loss experience for the purpose of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses for the revolving charge accounts portfolio. 
We identified the allowance for credit losses specific to the 
revolving charge accounts portfolio as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgment required by management in determining these qualitative adjustments. Given the subjective 
nature and judgment applied by management to determine the 
allowance for credit losses related to the revolving charge accounts portfolio, auditing the allowance for credit losses required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to testing the allowance for credit 
losses for the revolving charge accounts portfolio included the following: 
‚Ä¢ We tested the effectiveness of controls over the determination 
of the allowance for credit losses for the revolving charge 
accounts portfolio, including the qualitative factors considered. 
‚Ä¢ We evaluated the accuracy and relevance of the underlying historical data used in the Company‚Äôs model which included: 
‚Ä¢ Historical write-off experience 
‚Ä¢ Other historical loss metrics 
‚Ä¢ Portfolio duration 
‚Ä¢ Delinquency trends 
‚Ä¢ Trends in non-performing loans 
‚Ä¢ Trends in portfolio quality 
‚Ä¢ We tested the computational accuracy of the Company‚Äôs model. 
‚Ä¢ We evaluated the various qualitative adjustment factors considered in the Company‚Äôs determination of the allowance for credit losses. Our evaluation included: 
‚Ä¢ Comparison of the qualitative factors used by the Company to source data provided by the Company and/or to externally available data 
‚Ä¢ Consideration and evaluation of contradictory evidence 
‚Ä¢ Consideration of specific revolving charge accounts portfolio delinquency trends within particular geographic 
locations 
‚Ä¢ We evaluated management‚Äôs ability to accurately estimate the 
losses inherent in the revolving charge accounts portfolio by comparing management‚Äôs historical estimates to actual losses 
incurred.

36 MANAGEMENT‚ÄôS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER 
FINANCIAL REPORTING 
The management of Deere & Co mpany (the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù) is 
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal 
control over financial reporting.  The company‚Äôs internal control 
system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the preparation and fair presen tation of published financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. 
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have 
inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined 
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Management assessed the effectiveness of the company‚Äôs 
internal control over financial re porting as of November 3, 2019, 
using the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated 
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway  Commission. Based on that 
assessment, management believes that, as of November 3, 2019, the company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting was 
effective. 
The company‚Äôs independent regist ered public accounting firm 
has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the company‚Äôs 
internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.

R
EPORT OF INDEPENDENT  
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Deere & 
Company: 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of 
Deere & Company and subsidiaries (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) as of 
November 3, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control 
‚Äî Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 3, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control ‚Äî 
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the 
year ended November 3, 2019 of the Company and our report 
dated December 19 , 2019 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.  
B
asis for Opinion  
The Company‚Äôs management is responsible for maintaining 
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management‚Äôs Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent 
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the 
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
D
efinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial 
Reporting 
A company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company‚Äôs 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that  the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The notes to consolidated financial statements  are an integral part of this statement. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
42 1. ORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION 
Structure of Operations 
The information in the notes and related commentary are 
presented in a format that includes data grouped as follows: 
Equipment Operations  ‚Äì Includes the company‚Äôs agriculture and 
turf operations and construction and forestry operations with 
financial services reflected on the equity basis. 
Financial Services  ‚Äì Includes primarily the company‚Äôs financing 
operations. 
Consolidated  ‚Äì Represents the consolidation of the equipment 
operations and financial services. References to ‚ÄúDeere & 
Company‚Äù or ‚Äúthe company‚Äù refer to the entire enterprise. 
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements represent primarily the 
consolidation of all companies in which Deere & Company has a controlling interest. Certain variable interest entities (VIEs) are consolidated since the company is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs‚Äô economic performance and the 
obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that 
could potentially be significant to the VIEs. Deere & Company records its investment in each unconsolidated affiliated company (generally 20 to 50 percent ownership) at its related equity in the net assets of such affiliate (see Note 11). Other investments (less than 20 percent ownership) are recorded at cost. 
F
iscal Year 
The company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the last 
Sunday in the reporting period. The fiscal year ends for 2019 , 2018, and 2017 were November 3, 2019 , October 28, 2018, and October 29 , 2017 , respectively. Fiscal year 2019 contained 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 . 
V
ariable Interest Entities 
The company consolidates certain VIEs related to retail note 
securitizations (see Note 14). 
The company also has an interest in a joint venture that 
manufactures construction equipment in Brazil for local and 
overseas markets. The joint venture is a VIE; however, the company is not the primary beneficiary. Therefore, the entity‚Äôs financial results are not fully consolidated in the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements, but are includ ed on the equity basis. During 
2019 , the company made an additi onal contribution to the joint 
venture in exchange for non-voting preferred stock and terminated a loan guarantee. The maximum exposure to losses at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 in millions of dollars follows: 
 
        
  2019  2018  
Receivables from unconsolidated affiliates ...   $ 4    $ 2  
Investment in unconsolidated affiliates ....    18     
Loan guarantee ........................................      25  
Total .........................................................   $ 22  $ 27  
   2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The following are significant accounting policies in addition to 
those included in other notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
U
se of Estimates in Financial Statements 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts and related disc losures. Actual results could 
differ from those estimates. 
Revenue Recognition 
Sales of equipment and service parts are recognized when each of 
the following criteria are met: (1) the company and an independent 
customer approve a contract with commercial substance, (2) the 
sales price is determinable and collectability of the payments are probable based on the terms outlined in the contract, and (3) control of the goods has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control generally occurs for equipment and service parts when the good is delivered as specified in the contract and the risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred. In the U.S. and most 
international locations, this tran sfer occurs primarily when goods 
are shipped. In Canada and some other international locations, certain goods are shipped to dealers on a consignment basis under which the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the dealer at the time the goods are shipped. Accordingly, in these 
locations, sales are not recorded until a retail customer has 
purchased the goods. Generally, no right of return exists on sales of equipment. 
In limited instances, equipment is transferred to a customer or a 
financial institution with an obligation to repurchase the 
equipment for a specified amount, which is exercisable at the customer‚Äôs option. When the equipment is expected to be repurchased, those arrangements are accounted for as leases. When the operating lease criteria ar e met, no sale is recorded at 
the time of the equipment transfer and the difference between 
sale price and the specified repurchase amount is recognized as 
revenue on a straight-line basis until the customer‚Äôs option expires. When this equipment is not expected to be repurchased, a sale is recorded with a return obligation. 
Under the terms of sales agreements with dealers, interest-free 
periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and 
the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest is primarily charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods are 
sold to a retail customer by the dealer or the expiration of the 
interest-free period granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment is received by the company. Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed market rates. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after the company recognizes a sale and are responsible for payment even if the 
equipment is not sold to retail customers. If the interest-free or 
below market interest rate period exceeds one year, the company adjusts the expected sales revenue for the effects of the time  
 
43 value of money using a current market interest rate. The revenue 
related to the financing component is recognized in ‚ÄúFinance and interest income‚Äù using the interest method. The company does not 
adjust the sales price to account for a financing component if the 
expected interest-free or below market period is one year or less. 
Service parts and certain attachments returns are estimable and 
accrued at the time a sale is recognized. The estimated parts 
returns are recorded in ‚ÄúOther assets‚Äù for the inventory value of 
estimated part returns, adjusted for restocking fees. The estimated dealer refund liability, adjusted for restocking fees, is recorded in ‚ÄúAccounts payable and accrued expenses‚Äù. The estimated returns are based on historical return rates, current dealer inventory levels, and current economic conditions. 
The company remanufactures used engines and components 
(cores) that are sold to dealers and end customers for maintenance and repair parts. Revenue for remanufactured components is recognized using the same criteria  as other parts sales. When a 
remanufactured part is sold, the company collects a deposit that is repaid if the customer returns a core that meets certain specifications within a defined time period. The deposit received from the customer is recognized as a liability in accounts payable and accrued expenses and the used component that is expected to be returned is recognized in ot her assets in the consolidated 
balance sheet. When a customer returns a core, the deposit is repaid, the liability reversed, and the returned core is recorded in inventory to be remanufactured and sold to another customer. If a core is not returned within the required time as estimated, the deposit is recognized as revenue in net sales, and the estimated core return is recorded as an expense in cost of sales in the 
statement of consolidated income. 
Certain equipment is sold with precision guidance, telematics, and 
other information gathering and analyzing capabilities. The solutions require hardware, software, and include an obligation to 
provide telematic services for a specific period of time. These 
solutions are generally bundled with  the sale of the equipment, but 
can also be purchased or renewed separately. The revenue related to the hardware and embedded software is generally recognized at the time of the equipment sale and recorded in ‚ÄúNet sales‚Äù in the 
consolidated statement of income. The revenue for the future 
services is generally deferred and recognized over the service 
period. The deferred revenue is recorded as a contract liability in ‚ÄúAccounts payable and accrued expenses‚Äù in the consolidated balance sheet and is recognized in ‚ÄúOther income‚Äù with the associated expenses recognized in other operating expenses in the statement of consolidated income. 
Financing revenue is recorded over the lives of the related 
receivables using the interest method. Deferred costs on the origination of financing receivables are recognized as a reduction in ‚ÄúFinance and interest income‚Äù over the expected lives of the 
receivables using the interest method. Income and deferred costs 
on the origination of operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled lease terms in ‚ÄúFinance and interest income.‚Äù S
ales Incentives 
In certain markets, the company provides sales incentives to dealers. These incentives may be based on a dealer‚Äôs purchase 
volume or on retail sales incentive programs for allowances and 
financing programs that will be due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. At the time of the sale to a dealer, the company records an estimated cost of these programs as a reduction to the sales price. The estimated cost is based on historical data, announced and expected incentive programs, field 
inventory levels, and forecasted sales volumes. The final cost of 
these programs is determined at the end of the measurement period for volume-based incentives  or when the dealer sells the 
equipment to a retail customer. Actual cost differences from the original cost estimate are recognized in net sales. 
P
roduct Warranties 
For most equipment and parts sales, the company provides a 
standard warranty to provide assurance that the equipment will function as intended for a specified period. At the time a sale is recognized, the estimated future warranty costs are recorded. The company generally determines its total warranty liability by applying historical warranty claims rate experience to the 
estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still 
under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primaril y determined by a review of five-
year claims costs with consideration of current quality developments. The company also offers extended warranty arrangements for purchase at the customer‚Äôs option. The 
premiums for extended warranties are recognized in other income 
in the statement of consolidated income primarily in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. The unamortized extended warranty premiums (deferred revenue) are recorded in ‚ÄúAccounts payable and accrued expenses‚Äù in the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 23). 
S
ales and Transaction Taxes 
The company collects and remits taxes assessed by different 
governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the company and its customers. These taxes include sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes. The company elected to exclude these taxes from the 
determination of the sales price (excluded from revenues). 
S
hipping and Handling Costs 
Shipping and handling costs related to the sales of the company‚Äôs 
equipment after a customer obtains control of the equipment are accrued at the time of the sale in cost of sales. 
C
ontract Costs 
Incremental costs of obtaining a revenue contract are recognized 
as an expense when incurred sinc e the amortization period would 
be one year or less. 
Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred. This expense 
was $215 million in 2019 , $188 million in 2018, and $169 million in 
20 1 7.   
 
44 Depreciation and Amortization 
Property and equipment, capitalized software, and other 
intangible assets are generally stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation or amortization. These assets are depreciated over 
their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method. Equipment on operating leases is depreciated over the terms of the leases using the straight-line method. Property and equipment expenditures for new and revised products, increased capacity, and the replacement or major renewal of significant items 
are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor 
renewals are generally charged to expense as incurred. 
S
ecuritization of Receivables 
Certain financing receivables are periodically transferred to special 
purpose entities (SPEs) in securitization transactions (see Note 14). These securitizations qualify as collateral for secured borrowings 
and no gains or losses are recognized at the time of securitization. 
The receivables remain on the balance sheet and are classified as ‚ÄúFinancing receivables securitized - net.‚Äù The company recognizes finance income over the lives of these receivables using the interest method. 
R
eceivables and Allowances 
All financing and trade receivables are reported on the balance 
sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for credit losses, and any deferred fees or costs on originated financing receivables. The company also records an allowance and provision for credit losses related to the receivables from sales (trade receivables and certain financing receivables). 
The allowance is a reduction to the receivable balances and the 
provision is recorded in selling, administrative and general expenses. The allowance represents an estimate of the losses inherent in the receivable portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on many qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical net loss experience by finance product category, 
portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions in the 
company‚Äôs major markets and geographies, commodity price trends, and credit risk quality. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly by finance product category. Receivables are written-off to the allowance when the account is considered uncollectible (see Note 13). 
I
mpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Other Intangible 
Assets 
The company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets 
(including equipment on operating leases, property and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets) when events or circumstances warrant such a re view. Goodwill and intangible 
assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually at the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and more often if events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below the carrying value. Goodwill is allocated and reviewed for impairment by reporting units, which consist primarily of the operating segments and certain other reporting units. Goodwill is 
allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created 
the goodwill resides. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying 
value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the goodwill is considered impaired, the impairment is measured as the excess of the reporting unit‚Äôs carrying value over the fair value, with a limit of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If the carrying value of the long-
lived asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the 
amount by which the carrying valu e exceeds the fair value of the 
asset (see Notes 5 and 27). 
D
erivative Financial Instruments 
It is the company‚Äôs policy that derivative transactions are executed 
only to manage exposures arising in the normal course of business 
and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or 
trading. The company‚Äôs financial services operations manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities. The company also has foreign 
currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations 
related to buying, selling, and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies. In addition, the company has interest rate exposure at certain equipment operations units for below market retail financing programs that are used as sales incentives and are offered for extended periods.  
All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. Cash 
collateral received or paid is not offset against the derivative fair values on the balance sheet. Each derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, fair value hedge, or remains undesignated. 
Changes in the fair value of deri vatives that are designated and 
effective as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive 
income (OCI) and reclassified to the income statement when the effects of the item being hedged are recognized in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as fair value hedges are recognized 
currently in net income. These changes are offset in net income by 
fair value changes related to the risk being hedged on the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges are recognized currently in the income statement. 
All designated hedges are formally documented as to the 
relationship with the hedged item as well as the risk-management 
strategy. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, the 
hedge designation is removed, or the derivative is terminated, 
hedge accounting is discontinued (see Note 28). 
F
oreign Currency Translation 
The functional currencies for most of the company‚Äôs foreign 
operations are their respective local currencies. The assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the 
end of the period exchange rates. The revenues and expenses are 
translated at weighted-average rates for the period. The gains or losses from these translations are recorded in OCI. Gains or losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved and foreign exchange derivative contracts are included in net income. The  
 
45 pretax net loss for foreign exchange in 2019 , 2018, and 2017 was $13 
million, $8 million, and $62 million, respectively. 
  
3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
New Accounting Standards Adopted 
In the first quarter of 2019 , the company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in 
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue 
Recognition. The ASU was adopted using a modified-retrospective approach to all incomplete contracts as of the adoption date. The ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be 
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. A five-step model 
is used to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognized. The ASU also requires expanded disclosures to include disaggregated revenue by geographic regions and major product lines. 
The ASU required that a gross asset and liability rather than a net 
liability be recorded for the value of estimated service parts returns 
and the related refund liability. The gross asset is recorded in other assets for the inventory value of estimated parts returns and the gross liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued 
expenses for the estimated dealer refund. The table below reflects 
the change for the estimated parts returns in the affected lines on the consolidated balance sheet in millions of dollars. 
 
  October 28  Cumulative Effect  October 29  
  2018  from Adoption  2018  
Assets           
Other assets ...............   $ 1,718  $ 110  $ 1,828  
Liabilities           
Accounts payable and 
accrued expenses .....   $ 10, 111  $ 110  $ 10,221  
 
There were no significant changes affecting the timing of revenue 
recognition from the adoption. The company‚Äôs updated revenue 
policies are included in Note 2 and additional disclosures in Note 6. 
In the first quarter of 2019 , the company adopted ASU No. 2016-01, 
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends ASC 825-10, Financial Instruments ‚Äì 
Overall. This ASU changed the tr eatment for available for sale 
equity investments by recognizing unrealized fair value changes 
directly in net income and no longer in OCI. The cumulative effect of adoption resulted in an $8 milli on after-tax reclassification from 
OCI to retained earnings. 
In the first quarter of 2019 , the company adopted ASU No. 2016-18, 
Restricted Cash, which amends ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows. 
The ASU requires that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The ASU was adopted using a retrospective transition approach resulting in an 
update to the 2017 and 2018 consolidated and supplemental 
consolidating statement of cash flows (see Note 7). The ASU did not have a material effect on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements. 
In the first quarter of 2019 , the company early adopted ASU No. 
2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which amends ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The 
purpose of this ASU is to better align a company‚Äôs risk 
management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships, simplify the hedge accounting requirements, and improve the disclosures of hedging arrangements. The adoption did not have a material effect on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements (see Note 28). The company continues to 
evaluate potential additional hedge accounting relationships 
provided by the new standard to further improve risk management. 
The company also adopted the following standards in the first 
quarter of 2019 , none of which had a material effect on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements: 
 
Accounting Standards Updates   
2016-15‚ÄîClassification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, 
which amends ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows  
2016-16‚ÄîIntra-Entity Transfers of A ssets Other Than Inventory, which 
amends ASC 740, Income Taxes  
2017-01‚ÄîClarifying the Definition of a Business, which amends ASC 
805, Business Combinations  
2017-09‚ÄîScope of Modification Accounting, which amends ASC 718, 
Compensation - Stock Compensation  
2018-13‚ÄîDisclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure 
Requirements for Fair Value Meas urement, which amends ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurement  
2018-14‚ÄîDisclosure Framework - Change s to the Disclosure Requirements 
for Defined Benefit Plans, which amends ASC 715-20, Compensation - 
Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General  
2018-16‚ÄîInclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) 
Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge 
Accounting Purposes, which amends ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging  
New Accounting Standards to be Adopted 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 
842), which supersedes ASC 840, Leases. The ASU‚Äôs primary change is the requirement for lessee entities to recognize a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset during the term of operating lease arrangements. The ASU does not significantly 
change the lessee‚Äôs recognition, measurement, and presentation of 
expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard. Lessors‚Äô accounting under the AS U is largely unchanged from the 
previous accounting standard. The ASU also expands the disclosures for leases. The effective date is the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the ASU will be adopted using the modified-
retrospective approach that will not require earlier periods to be 
restated. The company will elect the optional practical expedients to not reassess whether existing contracts contain leases, not reassess lease classification, and not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases. The company will not elect the use of the hindsight practical expedient. In addition, the company will elect to combine 
lease and non-lease components for most asset classes and to not recognize a right of use asset or lease liability for arrangements that qualify as short-term leases. A software application for lessee  
 
46 accounting will be implemented for the adoption, along with new 
processes and controls. The estimated right of use assets and lease liabilities at adoption will be approximately $375 million. The 
adoption will not have a material effect on the company‚Äôs 
operating results or cash flows. 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of 
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which establishes ASC 326, 
Financial Instruments ‚Äì Credit Losses. The ASU revises the 
measurement of credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost from an incurred loss methodology to an expected loss methodology. The ASU affects trade receivables, debt securities, net investment in leases, and most other financial assets that represent a right to receive cash. Additional disclosures about 
significant estimates and credit quality are also required. In 
November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19 , Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments ‚Äì Credit Losses. This ASU clarifies that receivables from operating leases are accounted for using the lease guidance and not as financial instruments. In May 2019 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-05, 
Targeted Transition Relief, which amends ASC 326. This ASU 
provides an option to irrevocably elect to measure certain individual financial assets at fair value instead of amortized cost. In November 2019 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-11, Codification 
Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments ‚Äì Credit Losses. The ASU clarifies the treatment of expected recoveries for 
amounts previously written off on purchased receivables, provides 
transition relief for troubled debt restructurings, and allows for certain disclosure simplifications of accrued interest. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. The ASUs will be adopted using a modified-retrospec tive approach. The company is 
evaluating the potential effects on the consolidated financial 
statements. 
In March 2017 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, Premium 
Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which amends ASC 310-20, Receivables ‚Äì Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs. 
This ASU reduces the amortization period for certain callable debt 
securities held at a premium to the earliest call date. The treatment of securities held at a discount is unchanged. The effective date is 
the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The ASU will be adopted using a modified-retrospective approach . The adoption will not have a 
material effect on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial 
statements. 
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07 , Improvements to 
Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC 718, Compensation ‚Äì Stock Compensation. The ASU requires 
that most of the guidance related to stock compensation granted 
to employees be followed for non-employees, including the measurement date, valuation approach, and performance conditions. The expense is recogn ized in the same period as 
though cash were paid for the good or service. The effective date is the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The ASU will be adopted 
using a modified-retrospective approach. The adoption will not 
have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued  ASU No. 2018-15, Customer‚Äôs 
Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, which amends 
ASC 350-40, Intangibles ‚Äì Goodwill and Other ‚Äì Internal-Use 
Software. This ASU requires customers in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to evaluate the implementation costs of the hosting arrangement using the guidance to develop internal-use software. The project development stage determines the implementation costs that are capi talized or expensed. Capitalized 
implementation costs are amortized over the term of the service arrangement and are presented in the same income statement line item as the service contract costs. The effective date will be the first quarter of
 fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. The 
company will adopt the ASU on a prospective basis. The company is evaluating the potential effects on the company‚Äôs consolidated 
financial statements. 
In April 2019 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, Codification 
Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments ‚Äì Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial 
Instruments. The effective dates for the separate portions of the 
ASU and the expected effect on  the consolidated financial 
statements are as follows: (1) clarifications to ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, is the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, which is under evaluation, (2) clarifications to ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to 
Accounting for Hedging Activities is the first quarter of fiscal year 
2020, with early adoption permitted, which will not have a material effect, and (3) clarifications to ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities is the 
first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted, which will not have a material effect on the company‚Äôs 
consolidated financial statements.   
 
47 4. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

irtgen 
In December 2017 , the company acquired Wirtgen, which was a 
privately-held international company and is the leading manufacturer worldwide of road construction equipment. Headquartered in Germany, Wirtgen has six brands across the road 
building sector spanning processing, mixing, paving, compaction, 
and rehabilitation. Wirtgen sells products in more than 100 countries and had approximately 8,200 employees at the acquisition date. 
The total cash purchase price, net of cash acquired of $191 million, 
was $5,136 million, a portion of which is held in escrow to secure 
certain indemnity obligations of Wirtgen. In addition to the cash purchase price, the company assumed $1,641 million in liabilities, which represented substantially al l of Wirtgen‚Äôs liabilities. The 
company financed the acquisition and associated transaction 
expenses from a combination of cash and new debt financing, 
which consisted of medium-term notes, including ‚Ç¨850 million issued in September 2017 . The asset and liability fair values at the acquisition date in millions of dollars follow:

48 Wirtgen‚Äôs results are incorporated in the company‚Äôs consolidated 
financial statements using a one-month lag period and are included in the construction and forestry segment. The net sales 
and revenues and operating profit  included in the company‚Äôs 
statement of consolidated income in 2018 was $3,181 million and 
$116 million, respectively. During 2018, the company recognized $56 million of acquisition related costs, which were recorded $30 million in selling, administrative and general expenses and $26 million in other operating expenses. 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales and revenues and 
net income were prepared as if the acquisition closed at the beginning of fiscal year 2017 and follow in millions of dollars: 
 
  2018  2017  
Net sales and revenues  .......................   $ 37,822   $ 32,946   
Net income attributable to  
Deere & Company  ............................   $ 2,637   $ 2,272   
 
The pro forma amounts were calculated using policies consistent 
with the company‚Äôs accounting policies and included the additional 
expense from the amortization from the allocated purchase price adjustments. The pro forma results excluded acquisition related costs incurred in both years and assumed the medium-term notes used to fund the acquisition were issued in fiscal year 2016 at the 
interest rate of the actual notes. In addition, the pro forma results 
for the year ended October 29 , 2017 included nonrecurring pretax expenses of $291 million for the higher cost basis from the inventory fair value adjustment and $84 million for the amortization of identifiable intangible assets. Anticipated synergies or other expected benefits of the acquisition were not 
included in the pro forma results. As a result, the unaudited pro 
forma financial information may not have been indicative of the results for future operations or the results if the acquisition closed at the beginning of fiscal year 2017 . 
B
lue River 
In September 2017 , the company acquired Blue River Technology 
(Blue River), which is based in Sunnyvale, California for an 
acquisition cost of approximately $284 million, net of cash acquired of $4 million and $21 million funded to escrow for post-acquisition expenses. Blue River has designed and integrated computer vision and machine learning technology to optimize the use of farm inputs. Machine learning technologies could eventually 
be applied to a wide range of the company‚Äôs products. The asset 
and liability fair values at the acquisition date in millions of dollars follow: 
 
     
  September 2017  
Trade accounts and notes receivable ......................  $ 1  
Property and equipment  ........................................  2  
Goodwill ..................................................................    193

Accounts payable and accrued expenses  ...............  $ 1  
Deferred income taxes  ...........................................   36  
Total liabilities ......................................................  $ 37  
 The identifiable intangibles were primarily related to in-process 
research and development, which will not be amortized until the research and development efforts are complete or end.  
The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Blue River is 
included in the company‚Äôs agriculture and turf operating segment. 
For the acquisitions, the goodwill was the result of future cash 
flows and related fair value exceeding the fair value of the 
identified assets and liabilities. For the acquisitions other than Wirtgen, the results of these operat ions have been included in the 
company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements in the agriculture and turf operating segment and the pro forma results of operations as 
if these acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the current 
or comparative fiscal year would not differ significantly from the reported results. 
D
ispositions 
In October 2019 , the company sold its construction and forestry 
retail locations in Canada. At the time of the sale, total assets were 
$187 million consisting of inventory of $138 million, property and 
equipment ‚Äì net of $24 million, other assets of $3 million, and goodwill of $22 million. The liabilities consisted of $10 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses. In addition, the company accrued $15 million for transaction expenses and related costs. The total proceeds from the sale will be approximately $187 million, 
with $93 million received in the fourth quarter of 2019 . The 
remaining sales price is due based on standard payment terms of new equipment sales to independent dealers and separately negotiated terms ranging from 12 months to five years. A pretax loss of approximately $5 million was recorded in other operating expenses in the construction and forestry segment. 
In May 2018, the company sold construction and forestry retail 
locations in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. At the time of 
the sale, total assets were $74 million and liabilities were 
approximately $2 million. The asse ts consisted of trade accounts 
and notes receivable ‚Äì net of $3 million, inventory of $52 million, property and equipment ‚Äì net of $11 million, and goodwill of $8 million. The liabilities consisted of $2 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses. The total proceeds from the sale were 
approximately $84 million, with $67 million received in 2018. The 
remaining sales price was due based on standard payment terms of new equipment sales to independent dealers or refinanced wholesale terms. A pretax gain of $12 million was recorded in other income in the construction and forestry segment. 
In November 2017 , the company sold its construction and forestry 
retail locations in Florida. At the time of the sale, total assets were 
$93 million and liabilities were $1 million. The assets consisted of inventory of $61 million, property and equipment ‚Äì net of $21 million, goodwill of $10 million, and $1 million of other assets. The 
liabilities consisted of $1 million of accounts payable and accrued 
expenses. The total proceeds from the sale were approximately $105 million, with $89 million received in 2018. The remaining sales price was due based on standard payment terms of new equipment sales to independent dealers or refinanced wholesale terms. A pretax gain of $13 million was recorded in other income in the 
construction and forestry segment.  
 
49 For the retail location dispositions, the company sells equipment, 
service parts, and provides other services to the purchasers as independent dealers. 
 
5. SPECIAL ITEMS 
Impairments 
In the fourth quarter of 2019 , the company recorded non-cash charges in other operating expenses of approximately $59 million pretax for the impairment of equipment on operating leases and approximately $18 million pretax on matured operating lease inventory recorded in other assets. The impairment was the result 
of lower estimated values of used agriculture and construction 
equipment than originally estimate d with the probable effect that 
the future cash flows would not cover the carrying amount of the net assets. The assets are part of the financial services operations (see Note 27). 
In the fourth quarter of 2017 , the company recorded a non-cash 
charge of $40 million pretax in equity in loss of unconsolidated 
affiliates for an other than temporary decline in value of an investment in an international construction equipment manufacturer with a $14 million income tax benefit recorded in the 
provision for income taxes (see Note 27).  
E
mployee-Separation Programs 
During 2019, the company completed certain employee-
separation programs designed for specific functions and 
geographic areas as part of its on -going efforts to create a more 
efficient organizational structur e. The programs provided for 
cash payments based on years of  service. The expenses were 
recorded in the period the employees irrevocably accepted the 
separation offer. Th e programs‚Äô total pretax expenses were $30 
million, which were primarily recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. The total 2019 expenses were allocated approximately 18 
percent cost of sales, 2 percent research and development, and 
80 percent selling, administrative and general. In addition, the expenses were allocated 62 percent to the agriculture and turf operations, 8 percent to the construction and forestry 
operations, and 30 percent to th e financial services operations. 
Savings from these programs are estimated to be approximately 
$30 million in 2020.  
During the fourth quarter of 2016, the company announced 
voluntary employee-separation programs as part of its effort to reduce operating costs. The programs provided for cash payments 
based on previous years of service. The expense was recorded in 
the period the employees accepted the separation offer. The programs‚Äô total pretax expenses were $113 million, of which $11 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $102 million in 2017 . The total 2017 expenses were allocated approximately 30 percent cost of sales, 16 percent research and development, and 54 
percent selling, administrative and general. In addition, the 
expenses were allocated 75 percent to agriculture and turf operations, 17 percent to the construction and forestry operations, and 8 percent to the financial services operations. Savings from these programs were estimated to be approximately $70 million in 2017. S
ale of Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate 
In December 2016, the company sold approximately 38 percent of its interest in SiteOne Landscape Su pply, Inc. (SiteOne) resulting in 
gross proceeds of $114 million and a gain of $105 million pretax or $66 million after-tax. In April 2017 , the company sold an additional 68 percent of its then remaining interest in SiteOne resulting in gross proceeds of $184 million and a gain of $176 million pretax or $111 million after-tax. In July 2017 , the company sold its remaining interest in SiteOne resulting in gross proceeds of $98 million and a 
gain of $94 million pretax or $59 million after-tax. The gains were 
recorded in other income in the agriculture and turf operating segment. 
After the December 2016 sale, the company retained approximately 
a 15 percent ownership interest in SiteOne and approximately a 5 
percent ownership interest after the April sale. Prior to April 2017 , the company‚Äôs representation on the SiteOne board of directors allowed the company to exercise significant influence, and therefore, the investment in SiteOne was accounted for using the equity method. In March 2017 , the company reduced its 
representation on the SiteOne board of directors. As a result, 
beginning April 2017 the investment in SiteOne was recorded as an available-for-sale security and presented in marketable securities.

. CASH FLOW INFORMATION 
For purposes of the statement of consolidated cash flows, the 
company considers investments with purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Substantially all of the company‚Äôs short-term borrowings, excluding the current 
maturities of long-term borrowings, mature or may require 
payment within three months or less. 
The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade 
receivables to financial services. These intercompany cash flows 
are eliminated in the consolidated cash flows. 
All cash flows from the changes in trade accounts and notes 
receivable (see Note 13) are classified as operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows as these receivables arise 
from sales to the company‚Äôs customers. Cash flows from financing 
receivables that are related to sales to the company‚Äôs customers (see Note 13) are also included in operating activities. The remaining financing receivables are related to the financing of equipment sold by independent dealers and are included in investing activities. 
The company had the following non-cash operating and investing 
activities that were not included in the statement of consolidated cash flows. The company transferred inventory to equipment on  
 
51 operating leases of $679 million, $855 million, and $801 million in 
2019 , 2018, and 2017 , respectively. The company also had accounts payable related to purchases of property and equipment of $152 
million, $183 million, and $108 million at November 3, 2019 , October 
28, 2018, and October 29 , 2017 , respectively.

Total ........................................   $ 99  $ 111  $ 132  $ 154  
 
The equipment operations‚Äô restricted cash relates to miscellaneous 
operational activities. The financial services restricted cash primarily relates to securitization of financing receivables (see Note 
14). The restricted cash is recorded in other assets in the 
consolidated balance sheet.  
Cash payments for interest and income taxes consisted of the

The company has several funded and unfunded defined benefit 
pension plans and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans, 
primarily health care and life insurance plans, covering its U.S. employees and employees in certain foreign countries. The company uses an October 31 measurement date for these plans. 
The components of net periodic pension cost and the assumptions 
related to the cost consisted of the following in millions of dollars

52 The spot yield curve approach is used to estimate the service and 
interest cost components of the net periodic pension and OPEB costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used 
to determine the benefit plan obligations to relevant projected 
cash outflows. The components of net periodic pension and OPEB cost excluding the service component are included in the line item ‚ÄúOther operating expenses‚Äù in the Statement of Consolidated 
Income. 
The previous pension cost in net income and other changes in plan 
assets and benefit obligations in other comprehensive income in

In 2019 , the company made a voluntary contribution of $300 
million to a U.S. OPEB plan. In 2018, the company made voluntary 
contributions of $870 million to a U.S. pension plan and $430 
million to its U.S. OPEB plans. 
The actuarial loss for pension for 2019 was primarily due to a 
decrease in discount rates. The actuarial loss for OPEB for 2019 was 
primarily due to a decrease in discount rates partially offset by a 
decrease in health care trend rate s. The actuarial gain for pension 
and OPEB for 2018 was primarily du e to an increase in discount 
rates. 
The mortality assumptions for the 2019 and 2018 benefit plan 
obligations reflect the most recent tables and scales issued by the

The total accumulated benefit obligations for all pension plans at 
November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, were $13,430 million and 
$11,485 million, respectively. 
The accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets 
for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $1,836 million and $924 million, respectively, at 
November 3, 2019 and $1,710 million and $1,015 million, respectively, 
at October 28, 2018. The projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $10,097 million and $9 ,031 million, respectively, at November 3, 2019 and $1,833 million and $1,029 million, respectively, at October 28, 2018. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss). To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a 
component of net periodic cost over the remaining service period 
of the active participants. For plans in which all or almost all of the plan‚Äôs participants are inactive, the amortization period is the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. 
The company expects to contribute approximately $80 million to 
its pension plans and approximately $445 million to its OPEB plans 
in 2020. The anticipated OPEB contributions include a voluntary $300 million to a U.S. plan, which will increase plan assets. The pension and remaining OPEB contributions primarily include direct benefit payments from company funds. 
The benefits expected to be paid from the benefit plans, which 
reflect expected future years of service, are as follows in millions of 
dollars:

*       Net of prescription drug group benefit subsidy under Medicare Part D. 
 The annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered 
health care benefits (the health care cost trend rates) used to determine accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were 
based on the trends for medical and prescription drug claims for 
pre- and post-65 age groups due to the effects of Medicare. For the 2019 actuarial valuation, the weighted-average composite trend rates for these obligations were assumed to be an 8.6 percent increase from 2019 to 2020, gradually decreasing to 4.7 percent from 2027 to 2028 and all future years. The 2018 
obligations and the cost in 2019 assumed an 8.9 percent increase 
from 2018 to 2019, gradually decreasing to 4.8 percent from 2024 to 2025 and all future years.  
The discount rate assumptions used to determine the pension and 
OPEB obligations for all periods presented were based on 
hypothetical AA yield curves represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. These discount rates represent the rates 
at which the company‚Äôs benefit obligations could effectively be settled at the October 31 measurement dates.

otal net assets  ......................................   $  719      
Investments at net asset value in the preceding tables are 
measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical 
expedient, and therefore, are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. 
Fair values are determined as follows: 
Cash and Short-T erm Investments ‚Äì Include accounts that are 
valued based on the account value, which approximates fair value, and investment funds that are valued based on a constant fund net asset value (NAV) using the NAV per share practical expedient or on 
the fund‚Äôs NAV based on the fair value of the underlying securities. 
Also included are securities that are valued using a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data. 
Equity Securities and Funds
 ‚Äì The values are determined primarily 
by closing prices in the active market in which the equity 
investment trades, or the fund‚Äôs NAV , based on the fair value of the underlying securities. 
Fixed Income Securities and Funds
 ‚Äì The securities are valued using 
either a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all 
significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk, and prepayment speeds, or 
they are valued using the closing prices in the active market in 
which the fixed income investment trades. Fixed income funds are valued using the fund‚Äôs NAV , based on the fair value of the underlying securities. 
Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Equity, Hedge Funds, and 
Other
 ‚Äì The investments that are structured as limited  
 
55 partnerships are valued at estimated fair value based on their 
proportionate share of the limited partnership‚Äôs fair value that is determined by the respective general partner. These investments 
are valued using a combination of NAV , an income approach 
(primarily estimated cash flows discounted over the expected holding period), or market approach (primarily the valuation of similar securities and properties). Real estate investment trusts are primarily valued at the closing prices in the active markets in which the investment trades. 
Interest Rate, Foreign Currency, Equity, and Other Derivative 
Instruments
 ‚Äì The derivatives are valued using either an income 
approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates, 
or a market approach (closing prices in the active market in which 
the derivative instrument trades). 
The primary investment objective for the pension and health care 
plans assets is to maximize the growth of these assets to support 
the projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a long period of 
time, and to do so in a manner that is consistent with the company‚Äôs risk tolerance. The asset allocation policy is the most important decision in managing the assets and it is reviewed regularly. The asset allocation policy considers the company‚Äôs long-term asset class risk/return expectations for each plan since the 
obligations are long-term in nature. The current target allocations 
for pension assets are approximately 32 percent for equities, 45 percent for debt, 5 percent for real estate, and 18 percent for other investments. The target allocations for health care assets are approximately 58 percent for equities, 34 percent for debt, and 8 percent for other investments. The allocation percentages above 
include the effects of combining derivatives with other 
investments to manage asset allocations and exposures to interest rates and foreign currency exchange. The assets are well diversified and are managed by professional investment firms as well as by investment professionals who are company employees. As a result of the company‚Äôs diversified investment policy, there were no 
significant concentrations of risk. 
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects 
management‚Äôs expectations of long-term average rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the projected 
benefit obligations. A market related value of plan assets is used to 
calculate the expected return on assets. The market related value recognizes changes in the fair value of pension plan assets systematically over a five-year period. The market related value of the health care plan assets equals fair value. The expected return is based on the outlook for inflation and for returns in multiple asset 
classes, while also considering historical returns, asset allocation, and investment strategy. The company‚Äôs approach has emphasized the long-term nature of the return estimate such that the return assumption is not changed significantly unless there are fundamental changes in capital markets that affect the company‚Äôs expectations for returns over an extended period of time (i.e., 10 to 
20 years). The average annual return of the company‚Äôs U.S. 
pension fund was approximately 9 .6 percent during the past ten years and approximately 7 .9 percent during the past 20 years. Since return premiums over inflation and total returns for major asset classes vary widely even over ten-year periods, recent history is not necessarily indicative of long-term future expected returns. The 
company‚Äôs systematic methodology for determining the long-term 
rate of return for the company‚Äôs investment strategies supports its long-term expected return assumptions. 
The company has created certain Voluntary Employees‚Äô Beneficiary 
Association trusts (VEBAs) for the funding of postretirement 
health care benefits. The future expected asset returns for these VEBAs are lower than the expected return on the other pension and health care plan assets due to investment in a higher proportion of liquid securities. These assets are in addition to the other postretirement health care plan assets that have been 
funded under Section 401(h) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and 
maintained in a separate account in the company‚Äôs pension plan trust. 
The company has defined contribution plans related to employee 
investment and savings plans primarily in the U.S. The company‚Äôs 
contributions and costs under these plans were $192 million in 2019 , $206 million in 2018, and $188 million in 2017 . The contribution rate varies primarily based on the company‚Äôs performance in the prior year and employee participation in the plans.

. INCOME TAXES 
On December 22, 2017 , the U.S. government enacted tax reform. 
The primary provisions of tax reform affecting the company in 2018 were a reduction to the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and a transition from a worldwide corporate tax 
system to a primarily territorial tax system. The reduction in the 
corporate income tax rate required the company to remeasure its U.S. net deferred tax assets to the new corporate tax rate and the transition to a territorial tax system required payment of a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed and previously untaxed non-U.S. earnings (repatriation tax). The 
repatriation tax was paid in 2019 . 
In 2019 , the company was subject to additional provisions of the 
U.S. tax reform legislation. The company‚Äôs U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate was 21 percent and approximately 23.3 percent for 
2019 and 2018, respectively. The main provisions of tax reform 
affecting the company in 2019 include a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), a tax determined by base erosion and anti-abuse tax benefits (BEAT) for certain payments between a U.S. corporation and foreign subsidiaries, a limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, a deduction for 
foreign derived intangible income (FDII), and interest expense 
limitations. The combined effects of these provisions did not have a significant effect on the 2019 provision for income taxes. 
In 2019 and 2018, the company recorded discrete tax adjustments 
related to the remeasurement of the company‚Äôs net deferred tax 
assets to the new corporate income tax rate and for the repatriation tax.

Included in the equipment operations‚Äô repatriation tax amount was an accrual of approximately $63 million for 2018, which was 
reduced to $31 million for 2019 for foreign withholding taxes on 
earnings of subsidiaries outside the U.S. 
The repatriation tax expense is based on interpretations of existing 
laws, regulations, and certain assumptions. The company continues to analyze the repatriation tax provisions, and monitor 
legislative and regulatory developments. 
The provision for income taxes by taxing jurisdiction and by

Based upon the location of the company‚Äôs operations, the consolidated income before income taxes in the U.S. in 2019 , 2018, 
and 2017 was $2,166 million, $2,275 million, and $1,607 million, 
respectively, and in foreign countries was $1,922 million, $1,796 
million, and $1,547 million, respectively. Certain foreign operations are branches or partnerships of Deere & Company and are subject to U.S. as well as foreign income tax regulations. The pretax income by location and the preceding analysis of the income tax provision by taxing jurisdiction are not directly related. A comparison of the statutory and effective income tax provision and reasons for related differences in millions of dollars follow:

At November 3, 2019 , accumulated earnings in certain subsidiaries 
outside the U.S. totaled $2,608 million, of which a portion were subject to the repatriation tax in 2018, and are not subject to 
additional U.S. income tax. No provision for foreign withholding 
taxes has been made since these earnings are expected to remain indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Determination of the amount of a foreign withholding tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable. 
Deferred income taxes arise because there are certain items that 
are treated differently for financial accounting than for income tax reporting purposes. An analysis of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 in millions of dollars follows:

57 Deere & Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in 
the U.S., which includes the wholly-owned financial services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for income taxes generally 
as if they filed separate income tax returns, with a modification for 
realizability of certain tax benefits. 
At November 3, 2019 , tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of $781 
million were available with $319 mi llion expiring from 2020 through 
2039 and $462 million with an indefinite carryforward period. 
A reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits 
at November 3, 2019 , October 28, 2018, and October 29 , 2017 in millions of dollars follows: 
 
           
    2019    2 018    2 017   
Beginning of year balance ............................   $  279  $  221  $  198

current year  .............................................      30     36     35

End of year balance .....................................   $  553  $  279  $  221 
*       See Note 4. 
 
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at November 3, 2019 and 
October 28, 2018 that would affect the effective tax rate if the tax 
benefits were recognized was $153 million and $128 million, 
respectively. The increase from 2018 primarily relates to the interpretation of a recently issued repatriation tax regulation for companies that do not have a calendar fiscal year end. The increase was partially offset by the settlement of U.S. income tax positions related to the 2008 through 2014 tax years. The remaining liability 
was related to tax positions for which there are offsetting tax 
receivables, or the uncertainty was only related to timing. The company expects that any reasonably possible change in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months would not be significant. 
The company files its tax returns according to the tax laws of the 
jurisdictions in which it operates, which includes the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed the examination of 
the company‚Äôs federal income tax returns for periods prior to 2015. The years 2015, 2016, and 2017 federal income tax return are currently under examination. Various state and foreign income tax returns, including major tax jurisdictions in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, India, Mexico, 
Russia, Singapore, and Spain also remain subject to examination by 
taxing authorities. 
The company‚Äôs policy is to recognize interest related to income 
taxes in interest expense and interest income and recognize 
penalties in selling, administrati ve and general expenses. During 
2019 , 2018, and 2017 , the total amount of expense from interest and 
penalties was $13 million, $23 million, and $6 million and the interest income was $25 million,  $12 million, and $6 million, 
respectively. At November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, the liability for accrued interest and penalties totaled $76 million and $90 million, respectively, and the receivable for interest was $4 million and none, respectively.

11. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES 
Unconsolidated affiliated companies are companies in which 
Deere & Company generally owns 20 percent to 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares. Deere & Company does not control 
these companies and accounts for its investments in them on the 
equity basis. The investments in these companies primarily consist of Bell Equipment Limited (31 percent ownership), Deere-Hitachi Construction Machinery Corporation (50 percent ownership), and Deere-Hitachi Maquinas de Construcao do Brasil S.A. (50 percent ownership). In 2017 , the company sold its interest in SiteOne (see 
Note 5). The unconsolidated affiliated companies primarily 
manufacture or market equipment. Deere & Company‚Äôs share of the income or loss of these companies is reported in the consolidated income statement under ‚ÄúEquity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates.‚Äù The investment in these companies is reported in the consolidated bala nce sheet under ‚ÄúInvestments in 
unconsolidated affiliates.‚Äù 
Combined financial information of the unconsolidated affiliated 
companies in millions of dollars follows:

undistributed earnings of the unconsolidated affiliates of $135 million. Dividends from unconsolida ted affiliates were $30 million 
in 2019 , $12 million in 2018, and $4 million in 2017 . 
In the ordinary course of business, the company purchases and 
sells components and finished goods to the unconsolidated affiliated companies. Transactions with unconsolidated affiliated 
companies reported in the statement of consolidated income in

12. MARKETABLE SECURITIES 
All marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. Prior to 
2019 , all unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities were shown as a component of stockholders‚Äô equity. Beginning in 2019 with the adoption of ASU No. 2016-01, unrealized gains and losses on equity securities are shown as a component of net income (see 
Note 3). Realized gains or losses from the sales of marketable 
securities are based on the specific identification method. 
The amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities at

Unrealized gains on equity securities held at November 3, 2019 
were $17 million in total, with $7 million recognized in 2019 . Proceeds and realized gains on equity securities sold during 2019 and 2018 were not material. Proceeds and realized gains on equity securities sold in 2017 were $294 million and $273 million, respectively (see Note 5).  D

ebt securities ..................................................   $ 506   $ 522   
Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because 
some securities may be called or prepaid. Because of the potential 
for prepayment on mortgage-backed securities, they are not categorized by contractual maturity. Proceeds from the sales of debt securities were $31 million in 2019 , $40 million in 2018, and 
$109 million in 2017 . Realized gains, realized losses, the increase 
(decrease) in net unrealized gains or losses, and unrealized losses that have been continuous for over twelve months were not significant in 2019 , 2018, and 2017 . Unrealized losses at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 were primarily the result of an increase in interest rates and were not recognized in income due to the 
ability and intent to hold to maturity. There were no significant 
impairment write-downs in the periods reported.

The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade 
receivables to financial services and provide compensation to 
these operations at approximate market rates of interest. 
Trade accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales of 
goods to independent dealers. Under the terms of the sales to 
dealers, interest is primarily charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain interest-free periods granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment  
 
59 is received by the company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after 
the company recognizes a sale and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers. The interest-
free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold 
and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed market rates. The company evaluates and assesses dealers on an ongoing basis as to their creditworthiness 
and generally secures the receivables by retaining a security 
interest in the goods associated with the trade receivables or with other financial instruments. In certain jurisdictions, the company is obligated to repurchase goods sold to a dealer upon cancellation or termination of the dealer‚Äôs contract for such causes as change in ownership and closeout of the business. 
Trade accounts and notes receivable include receivables from sales 
to certain retail customers with payment terms less than twelve months. The customer cannot cancel purchases or return the equipment after delivery. The company evaluates and assesses 
retail customers at the time of purchase as to their 
creditworthiness and generally retains a security interest in the goods associated with the receivables. 
Trade accounts and notes receivable have significant 
concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf sector and 
construction and forestry sector as shown in the previous table. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area.

The residual values for investments in financing leases at 
November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 totaled $333 million and 
$294 million, respectively. Financing receivables have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf sector and construction and forestry sector as shown in the previous table. On a geographic basis, there 
is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area. 
The company generally retains as collateral a security interest in the equipment associated with retail notes, wholesale notes, and financing leases. 
Financing receivables at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018

The maximum terms for retail notes are generally seven years for 
agriculture and turf equipment and five years for construction and forestry equipment. The maximum term for financing leases is 
generally six years, while the average term for wholesale notes is 
less than twelve months. 
At November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, worldwide net 
financing receivables administered, which include financing 
receivables administered but not owned, totaled $33,583 million 
and $31,082 million, respectively.  
 
60 Past due balances of financing receivables still accruing finance 
income represent the total balance held (principal plus accrued interest) with any payment amounts 30 days or more past the 
contractual payment due date. Non-performing financing 
receivables represent loans for which the company has ceased accruing finance income. Beginning in 2019 , the company ceased accruing finance income when these receivables are generally 90 days delinquent. Previously, finance income ceased accruing when the receivables were generally 120 days delinquent. This change in 
estimate was made on a prospective basis and did not have a 
significant effect on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements. Management‚Äôs methodology to determine the collectability of delinquent accounts was not affected by the change. Generally, when receivables are 120 days delinquent the estimated uncollectible amount, after charging the dealer‚Äôs 
withholding account, if any, is written off to the allowance for 
credit losses. Finance income for non-performing receivables is recognized on a cash basis. Accrual of finance income is generally resumed when the receivable becomes contractually current and collections are reasonably assured.

accruing interest and non-performing financing receivables at

Past-due amounts over 30 days represented 1.23 percent and 1.70 
percent of the receivables financed at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively. The allowance for credit losses represented .44 percent and .57 percent of financing receivables 
outstanding at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, 
respectively. In addition, at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, the company‚Äôs financial servic es operations had $152 million 
and $156 million, respectively, of deposits primarily withheld from 
dealers and merchants available for potential credit losses. 
Financing receivables are considered impaired when it is probable 
the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to 
the contractual terms. Receivables reviewed for impairment generally include those that are past due, have provided bankruptcy notification, or require significant collection efforts. 
Receivables that are impaired are generally classified as non-
performing. An analysis of the impaired fina ncing receivables at November 3,

A troubled debt restructuring is generally the modification of debt 
in which a creditor grants a concession it would not otherwise 
consider to a debtor that is experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications may include a reduction of the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity dates, a reduction of the face amount or maturity amount of the debt, or a reduction of accrued interest. During 2019 , 2018, and 2017 , the company identified 522, 
587 , and 474 receivable contracts, primarily trade receivables and 
retail notes, as troubled debt restructurings with aggregate balances of $36 million, $34 million, and $16 million pre-modification and $35 million, $34 million, and $15 million post-modification, respectively. In 2017 , there were $3 million of troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted and were 
written off. In 2019 and 2018, there were no significant troubled 
debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted and were written off. At November 3, 2019 , the company had commitments to lend approximately $18 million to borrowers whose accounts were modified in troubled debt restructurings.

62 14. SECURITIZATION OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES 
The company, as a part of its overall funding strategy, periodically 
transfers certain financing receivables (retail notes) into VIEs that 
are SPEs, or non-VIE banking operations, as part of its asset-backed securities programs (sec uritizations). The structure of 
these transactions is such that the transfer of the retail notes did not meet the accounting criteria for sales of receivables, and is, therefore, accounted for as a secured borrowing. SPEs utilized in 
securitizations of retail notes differ from other entities included in 
the company‚Äôs consolidated statements because the assets they hold are legally isolated. Use of the assets held by the SPEs or the non-VIEs is restricted by terms of the documents governing the securitization transactions. 
In these securitizations, the retail notes are transferred to certain 
SPEs or to non-VIE banking operations, which in turn issue debt to 
investors. The debt securities issued to the third party investors result in secured borrowings, which are recorded as ‚ÄúShort-term securitization borrowings‚Äù on the consolidated balance sheet. The 
securitized retail notes are recorded as ‚ÄúFinancing receivables 
securitized - net‚Äù on the balance sheet. The total restricted assets on the balance sheet related to these securitizations include the financing receivables securitized less an allowance for credit losses, and other assets primarily representing restricted cash. Restricted cash results from contractual requirements in securitized 
borrowing arrangements and serves as a credit enhancement. The 
restricted cash is used to satisfy payment deficiencies, if any, in the required payments on secured borrowings. The balance of restricted cash is contractually stipulated and is either a fixed amount as determined by the initial balance of the financing receivables securitized or a fixed percentage of the outstanding 
balance of the securitized financing receivables. The restriction is 
removed either after all secured borrowing payments are made or proportionally as these receivables are collected and borrowing obligations reduced. For those securitizations in which retail notes are transferred into SPEs, the SPEs supporting the secured borrowings are consolidated unless the company does not have 
both the power to direct the activities that most significantly 
impact the SPEs‚Äô economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the SPEs. No a dditional support to these SPEs 
beyond what was previously contractually required has been provided during the reporting periods. 
In certain securitizations, the company consolidates the SPEs since 
it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPEs‚Äô economic performance through its role as servicer of all the receivables held by the SPEs, and the obligation 
through variable interests in the SPEs to absorb losses or receive 
benefits that could potentially be significant to the SPEs. The restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses, and other assets) of the consolidated SPEs totaled $2,895 million and $2,593 million at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization 
borrowings and accrued interest) of these SPEs totaled $2,847 
million and $2,520 million at No vember 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively. The credit holders of these SPEs do not have legal recourse to the company‚Äôs general credit. 
In certain securitizations, the company transfers retail notes to 
non-VIE banking operations, which are not consolidated since the 
company does not have a controlling interest in the entities. The company‚Äôs carrying values and interests related to the securitizations with the unconsolidated non-VIEs were restricted 
assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses and 
other assets) of $491 million and $504 million at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) were $465 million and $475 million at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively. 
In certain securitizations, the company transfers retail notes into 
bank-sponsored, multi-seller, commercial paper conduits, which are SPEs that are not consolidated. The company does not service a significant portion of the conduits‚Äô receivables, and therefore, 
does not have the power to direct the activities that most 
significantly impact the conduits‚Äô economic performance. These conduits provide a funding source to the company (as well as other transferors into the conduit) as they fund the retail notes through the issuance of commercial paper. The company‚Äôs carrying values and variable interest related to these conduits were restricted 
assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses, and 
other assets) of $1,079 million and $1,033 million at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) related to these conduits were $1,015 million and $965 million at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively. 
The company‚Äôs carrying amount of the liabilities to the 
unconsolidated conduits, compared to the maximum exposure to loss related to these conduits, which would only be incurred in the event of a complete loss on the restricted assets, was as follows at 
November 3 in millions of dollars: 
    
     2 019   
Carrying value of liabilities  ................................................   $ 1,015    
Maximum exposure to loss  ................................................     1,079   
The total assets of unconsolidated VIEs related to securitizations were approximately $37 billion at November 3, 2019 . 
The components of consolidated restricted assets related to 
secured borrowings in securitization transactions at November 3, 
2019 and October 28, 2018 were as follows in millions of dollars: 
       
         2 019              2 018       
Financing receivables securitized (retail notes) .......   $  4,395  $  4,032   
Allowance for credit losses ..................................      (12)    (10) 
Other assets ........................................................      82     108  
Total restricted securitized assets ......................    $  4,465   $  4,130   
 
63 The components of consolidated secured borrowings and other 
liabilities related to securitizations at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 were as follows in millions of dollars:
  
 
        
      2 019      2 018   
Short-term securitization borrowings ....................   $ 4,321   $ 3,957    
Accrued interest on borrowings ..............................     6     3   
Total liabilities related to restricted securitized assets ....    $ 4,327    $3,960   
 
The secured borrowings related to these restricted securitized 
retail notes are obligations that are payable as the retail notes are liquidated. Repayment of the secured borrowings depends primarily on cash flows generated by the restricted assets. Due to 
the company‚Äôs short-term credit rating, cash collections from these 
restricted assets are not required to be placed into a segregated collection account until immediately prior to the time payment is required to the secured creditors. At November 3, 2019 , the maximum remaining term of all securitized retail notes was approximately six years. 
  
15. EQUIPMENT ON OPERATING LEASES 
Operating leases arise primarily from the leasing of John Deere equipment to retail customers. Initial lease terms generally range from 12 to 60 months. Net equipment on operating leases at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 consisted of the following 
in millions of dollars: 
 
 
        
      2 019      2 018  
Equipment on operating leases:        
Agriculture and turf  .......................................   $5,888   $5,682   
Construction and forestry  ...............................     1,679     1,483   
Equipment on operating leases ‚Äì net ....................    $ 7,567    $ 7,165   
The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease. The accumulated depreciation on this equipment was $1,855 million and $1,515 million at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively. The corresponding depreciation expense was 
$981 million in 2019 , $928 million in 2018, and $853 million in 2017 . 
Future payments to be received on operating leases totaled $2,498 
million at November 3, 2019 and are scheduled in millions of dollars as follows: 2020 - $1,086, 2021 - $759, 2022 - $419, 2023 - $193, and 2024 - $41. At November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, the 
company‚Äôs financial services operations had $12 million and $34 
million, respectively, of deposits wi thheld from dealers available for 
potential losses on residual values. 
Equipment returned to the company upon termination of leases 
and held for subsequent sale or lease is recorded in ‚ÄúOther assets‚Äù 
at the lower of net book value or estimated fair value of the equipment less costs to sell and is not depreciated. The matured operating lease inventory at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 was $163 million and $247 million, respectively. 
  
 16. INVENTORIES 
A majority of inventory owned by Deere & Company and its U.S. 
equipment subsidiaries are valued at cost, on the ‚Äúlast-in, first-out‚Äù 
(LIFO) basis. Remaining inventor ies are generally valued at the 
lower of cost, on the ‚Äúfirst-in, first-out‚Äù (FIFO) basis, or net realizable value. The value of gross inventories on the LIFO basis at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 represented 55 percent and 54 percent, respectively, of worldwide gross inventories at 
FIFO value. The pretax favorable income effect from the liquidation

  19. TOTAL SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS 
Total short-term borrowings at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 consisted of the following in millions of dollars: 
    2019      2 018  
Equipment Operations

Totalshort-termborrowings ..........................   $ 15,105    $ 15,019   
*    Includes unamortized fair value adjustments related to interest rate swaps.  
The short-term securitization borr owings are secured by financing 
receivables (retail notes) on the balance sheet (see Note 14). Although these securitization borrowings are classified as short-term since payment is required if the retail notes are liquidated 
early, the payment schedule for these borrowings, which are net of 
debt acquisition costs, at November 3, 2019 based on the expected liquidation of the retail notes in millions of dollars is as follows: 2020 - $2,174, 2021 - $1,278, 2022 - $663, 2023 - $195, 2024 - $15, and 2025 - $1. 
The weighted-average interest rates on total short-term 
borrowings, excluding current maturities of long-term borrowings, 
at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 were 2.9 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively. 
Lines of credit available from U.S. and foreign banks were $8,499 
million at November 3, 2019 . At November 3, 2019 , $5,143 million of 
these worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper, and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were primarily 
considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit 
lines at November 3, 2019 was a 364-day credit facility agreement of $2,800 million, expiring in fiscal April 2020. In addition, total credit lines included long-term credit facility agreements of $2,500 million, expiring in April 2023, and $2,500 million, expiring in April 2024. The agreements are mutually extendable and the 
annual facility fees are not significant. These credit agreements 
require Capital Corporation to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder‚Äôs equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal 
quarter. The credit agreements also require the equipment operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total  
 
65 debt and stockholders‚Äô equity excluding accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss)) of 65 percent or less at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, the company‚Äôs excess 
equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of restriction at 
November 3, 2019 was $13,554 million. Alternatively under this provision, the equipment operations had the capacity to incur additional debt of $25,171 million at November 3, 2019 . All of these credit agreement requirements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements. 
Deere & Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation 
pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to 
maintain Capital Corporation‚Äôs consolidated tangible net worth at 
not less than $50 million. This agreement also obligates Deere & Company to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. Deere & Company‚Äôs obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are 
independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its 
indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, Deere & Company‚Äôs obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporation‚Äôs indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Deere & Company‚Äôs obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of 
any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of Capital 
Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement during the periods included in  the consolidated financial 
statements.

23. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
The company generally determines its total warranty liability by 
applying historical claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based 
on dealer inventories and retail sale s. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and 
current quality developments. 
The premiums for extended warranties are primarily recognized in 
income in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the 
contract period. The unamortized extended warranty premiums (deferred revenue) included in the following table totaled $582 million and $506 million at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, 
respectively. 
A reconciliation of the changes in the warranty liability and 
unearned premiums in millions of dollars follows:

At November 3, 2019 , the company had approximately $343 million of guarantees issued primarily to banks outside the U.S. and Canada related to third-party receivables for the retail financing of 
John Deere and Wirtgen equipment. The company may recover a 
portion of any required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the equipment collateralizing the receivables. At November 3, 2019 , the company had accrued losses of approximately $14 million under these agreements. The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at 
November 3, 2019 was approximately seven years. 
At November 3, 2019 , the company had commitments of 
approximately $281 million for the construction and acquisition of property and equipment. Also at November 3, 2019 , the company 
had restricted assets of $88 million, classified as ‚ÄúOther assets‚Äù. 
See Note 14 for additional restricted assets associated with borrowings related to securitizations. 
The company also had other miscellaneous contingent liabilities 
totaling approximately $65 million at November 3, 2019 . The 
accrued liability for these contingencies was not material at November 3, 2019 . 
The company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which 
arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of 
which relate to product liability (including asbestos related liability), retail credit, employment, patent, and trademark matters. The company believes the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions would not have a material effect on its financial statements.  
 
67 24. CAPITAL STOCK 
Changes in the common stock account in millions were as follows: 
 
       
  Number of      
      Shares Issued      Amount

The number of common shares the company is authorized to issue 
is 1,200 million. The number of authorized preferred shares, none 
of which has been issued, is nine million. 
The Board of Directors at its meeting in December 2013 authorized 
the repurchase of up to $8,000 million of common stock (45.4 
million shares based on the fiscal year end closing common stock price of $176.11 per share). At the end of the fiscal year, this repurchase program had $1,075 million (6.1 million shares at the same price) remaining to be repurchased. Repurchases of the company‚Äôs common stock under this plan will be made from time 
to time, at the company‚Äôs discretion, in the open market. 
A reconciliation of basic and diluted net income per share 
attributable to Deere & Company follows in millions, except per 
share amounts: 
 
       2 019          2 018           2 017

All stock options outstanding were included in the computation 
except .7 million in 2019 , .4 million in 2018, and .2 million in 2017 that 
had an antidilutive effect under the treasury stock method. 
 
25. STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS 
The company issues stock options and restricted stock awards to 
key employees under plans approved by stockholders. Restricted stock is also issued to nonemployee directors for their services as 
directors under a plan approved by stockholders. Options are 
awarded with the exercise price equal to the market price and become exercisable in one to three years after grant. Options expire ten years after the date of grant. Restricted stock awards generally vest after three years. The compensation cost for stock options, service based restricted stock units, and market/service 
based restricted stock units, which is based on the fair value at the 
grant date, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite period the employee is requir ed to render service. The 
compensation cost for performance/service based units, which is based on the fair value at the grant date, is recognized over the employees‚Äô requisite service period and periodically adjusted for 
the probable number of shares to be awarded. According to these plans at November 3, 2019 , the company is authorized to grant an 
additional 8.3 million shares related to stock options or restricted stock. 
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of 
grant using a binomial lattice option valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded call options on the company‚Äôs stock. The expected volatilities are constructed 
from the following three components: the starting implied 
volatility of short-term call options traded within a few days of the valuation date; the predicted implied volatility of long-term call options; and the trend in implied volatilities over the span of the call options‚Äô time to maturity. The company uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee termination 
within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted 
is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rates utilized for periods throughout the contractual life of the options are based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant. 
The assumptions used for the binomial lattice model to determine 
the fair value of options follow:

*    Weighted-averages 
The weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted during 2019 , 2018, and 2017 were $46.96, $39 .11, and $24.46, respectively. The total intrinsic values of options exercised during 2019 , 2018, and 2017 were $186 million, $229 million, and $225 
million, respectively. During 2019 , 2018, and 2017 , cash received 
from stock option exercises was $178 million, $217 million, and $529 million with tax benefits of $44 million, $54 million, and $83 million, respectively. 
The company granted 447 thousand, 415 thousand, and 579 
thousand restricted stock units to employees and nonemployee 
directors in 2019 , 2018, and 2017 , of which 355 thousand, 330 thousand, and 465 thousand are subject to service based only conditions, 92 thousand, 85 thousand, and 57 thousand are subject to performance/service based conditions, and none, none,  
 
68 and 57 thousand are subject to market/service based conditions, 
respectively. The service based only units award one share of common stock for each unit at the end of the vesting period and 
include dividend equivalent payments. 
The performance/service based units are subject to a performance 
metric based on the company‚Äôs compound annual revenue growth rate, compared to a benchmark group of companies over the 
vesting period. The market/service based units are subject to a 
market related metric based on total shareholder return, compared to the same benchmark group of companies over the vesting period. The performance/service based units and the market/service based units both award common stock in a range of zero to 200 percent for each unit granted based on the level of the 
metric achieved and do not
 include dividend equivalent payments 
over the vesting period. The weighted-average fair values of the 
service based only units at the grant dates during 2019 , 2018, and 2017 were $149 .54, $151.67 , and $101.03 per unit, respectively, based on the market price of a share of underlying common stock. The fair value of the performance/service based units at the grant date 
during 2019 , 2018, and 2017 were $140.49 , $145.33, and $93.86 per 
unit, respectively, based on the market price of a share of underlying common stock excluding dividends. The fair value of the market/service based units at the grant date during 2017 was $129 .70 per unit based on a lattice valuation model excluding dividends.

During 2019 , 2018, and 2017 , the total share-based compensation 
expense was $82 million, $84 million, and $68 million, respectively, 
with recognized income tax benefits of $20 million, $20 million, and $25 million, respectively. At November 3, 2019 , there was $51 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans, which is related to restricted shares and options. This compensation is 
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
approximately two years. The total grant-date fair values of stock options and restricted shares vested during 2019 , 2018, and 2017 were $66 million, $63 million, and $72 million, respectively.

27. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. To 
determine fair value, the company uses various methods including market and income approaches. The company utilizes valuation models and techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs. The models are industry-standard models that consider various assumptions including time values and yield curves as well 
as other economic measures. These valuation techniques are 
consistently applied. Level 1 measurements consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 measurements include significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for 
similar assets or liabilities in active markets; identical assets or 
liabilities in inactive markets; observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves; and other market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 measurements include significant unobservable inputs. 
The fair values of financial instruments that do not approximate 
the carrying values at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 in 
millions of dollars follow:

*    Fair value measurements above were Level 3 for all financing receivables, Level 3 
for equipment operations short-term securitization borrowings, and Level 2 for 
all other borrowings. 
Fair values of the financing receivables that were issued long-term were based on the discounted values of their related cash flows at interest rates currently being offered by the company for similar 
financing receivables. The fair values of the remaining financing 
receivables approximated the carrying amounts. 
Fair values of long-term borrowings and short-term securitization 
borrowings were based on current market quotes for identical or 
similar borrowings and credit risk, or on the discounted values of 
their related cash flows at current market interest rates. Certain long-term borrowings have been swapped to current variable interest rates. The carrying values of these long-term borrowings included adjustments related to fair value hedges.

financing receivables with specific allowances in Note 13 that were not

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies the 
company uses to measure certain financial instruments on the 
balance sheet at fair value: 
Marketable Securities ‚Äì The portfolio of investments, except for 
the Level 3 measurement international debt securities, is primarily 
valued on a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all 
significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk, and prepayment speeds. Funds are primarily valued using the fund‚Äôs net asset value, based on the fair value of the underlying securities. The Level 3 measurement 
international debt securities are primarily valued using an income 
approach based on discounted cash flows using yield curves derived from limited, observable market data. 
Derivatives  ‚Äì The company‚Äôs derivative financial instruments 
consist of interest rate swaps and caps, foreign currency futures, 
forwards and swaps, and cross-currency interest rate swaps. The portfolio is valued based on an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates for currencies. 
Financing Receivables ‚Äì Specific reserve impairments are based on 
the fair value of the collateral, which is measured using a market 
approach (appraisal values or realizable values). Inputs include a selection of realizable values (see Note 13). 
Equipment on Operating Leases ‚Äì Net  ‚Äì The impairments are based 
on an income approach (discounted cash flow), using the 
contractual payments, plus an estimate of equipment sale price at lease maturity. Inputs include realized sales values. 
Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates ‚Äì Other than temporary 
impairments for investments are measured as the difference 
between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the investments. The fair value for publicly traded entities is the share price multiplied by the shares owned (see Note 5). 
Other Assets  ‚Äì The impairments are measured at the fair value of 
the matured operating lease inventory. The valuations were based 
on a market approach. The inputs include sales of comparable assets (see Note 5).  
 
72 28. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
Cash Flow Hedges 
Certain interest rate and cross-currency interest rate contracts 
(swaps) were designated as hedges of future cash flows from borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receive-variable/pay-fixed interest rate contracts at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 were $3,150 million and $3,050 million, respectively. During 2019 , the company hedged a portion of its 
exposure to interest rate changes on a forecasted debt issuance 
using an interest rate contract with a term of 30 years. The hedge was terminated upon issuance of the debt, resulting in a fair value loss of $70 million. Fair value gains or losses on cash flow hedges were recorded in OCI and are subsequently reclassified into interest expense or other operating expenses (foreign exchange) in 
the same periods during which the hedged transactions impact 
earnings. These amounts offset the effects of interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate changes on the related borrowings. The cash flows from these contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of  consolidated cash flows. 
The amount of loss recorded in OCI at November 3, 2019 that is 
expected to be reclassified to interest expense or other operating 
expenses in the next twelve months if interest rates or exchange rates remain unchanged is approximately $8 million after-tax. There were no gains or losses reclassified from OCI to earnings 
based on the probability that the original forecasted transaction 
would not occur. 
F
air Value Hedges 
Certain interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as fair 
value hedges of borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate contracts at November 3, 
2019 and October 28, 2018 were $8,717 million and $8,479 million, 
respectively. The fair value gains or losses on these contracts were generally offset by fair value gains or losses on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings) with both items recorded in interest expense. 
The amounts recorded, at November 3, 2019, in the consolidated 
balance sheet related to borrowings designated in fair value 
hedging relationships in millions of dollars follow:

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
The company has certain interest ra te contracts (swaps and caps), 
foreign exchange contracts (futures, forwards and swaps), and cross-currency interest rate cont racts (swaps), which were not 
formally designated as hedges. These derivatives were held as 
economic hedges for underlying in terest rate or foreign currency exposures primarily for certain borrowings, purchases or sales of 
inventory, and below market retail financing programs. The total notional amounts of the interest rate swaps at November 3, 2019 
and October 28, 2018 were $9,166 million and $8,075 million, the 
foreign exchange contracts were $4,962 million and $6,842 million, and the cross-currency interest rate contracts were $92 million and $81 million, respectively. To facilitate borrowings through securitization of retail note s, interest rate caps were sold 
with notional amounts of $6 million and $66 million at November 
3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respec tively. Interest rate caps were 
also purchased with notional amounts of $6 million and $66 
million, at the same dates. The fair value gains or losses from the interest rate contracts were re cognized currently in interest 
expense and the gains or losses from foreign exchange contracts in cost of sales or other operati ng expenses, generally offsetting 
over time the expenses on the exposures being hedged. The cash flows from these non-designated contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows. 
Fair values of derivative instruments in the consolidated balance 
sheet at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 in millions of

Counterparty Risk and Collateral 
Derivative instruments are subject to significant concentrations of 
credit risk to the banking sector. The company manages individual counterparty exposure by setting limits that consider the credit rating of the counterparty, the credit default swap spread of the counterparty, and other financial commitments and exposures between the company and the counterparty banks. All interest rate 
derivatives are transacted under International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. Some of these agreements include credit support provisions. Each master agreement permits the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of default or termination. 
Certain of the company‚Äôs derivative agreements contain credit 
support provisions that may require the company to post collateral 
based on the size of the net liability positions and credit ratings. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, was $68 million and $350 million, respectively. In accordance with the limits established in 
these agreements, the company posted none and $59 million in 
cash collateral at November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018, respectively. 
 Derivatives are recorded without offsetting for netting arrangements or collateral. The impact on the derivative assets and liabilities related to netting arrangements and any collateral paid at 
November 3, 2019 and October 28, 2018 in millions of dollars

29. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA 
The company‚Äôs operations are presently organized and reported in 
three major business segments described as follows: 
The agriculture and turf segment primarily manufactures and 
distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts, including large, medium, and utility tractors; tractor loaders; combines, cotton pickers, cotton strippers, and sugarcane 
harvesters; harvesting front-end equipment; sugarcane loaders 
and pull-behind scrapers; tillage, seeding, and application equipment, including sprayers, nutrient management, and soil preparation machinery; hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers and mowers; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment and 
walk-behind mowers, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, and 
commercial mowing equipment, along with a broad line of associated implements; integrated agricultural management systems technology and solutions; and other outdoor power products. 
The construction and forestry segment primarily manufactures and 
distributes a broad range of machines and service parts used in 
construction, earthmoving, road building, material handling, and timber harvesting, including back hoe loaders; crawler dozers and 
loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; excavators; motor graders; 
articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders; skid-steer loaders; 
milling machines; recyclers; slipform pavers; surface miners; asphalt pavers; compactors; tandem and static rollers; mobile crushers and screens; mobile and stationary asphalt plants; log skidders; feller bunchers; log loaders; log forwarders; log harvesters; and related logging attachments. 
The products and services produced by the segments above are 
marketed primarily through indepe ndent retail dealer networks 
and major retail outlets. 
The financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases 
by John Deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf 
equipment and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving 
charge accounts, and offers extended equipment warranties. 
Because of integrated manufacturing operations and common 
administrative and marketing support, a substantial number of  
 
74 allocations must be made to determine operating segment and 
geographic area data. Intersegment sales and revenues represent sales of components and finance charges, which are generally 
based on market prices. 
Information relating to operations by operating segment in millions 
of dollars follows for the years ended November 3, 2019 , October 28, 2018, and October 29 , 2017 . In addition to the following 
unaffiliated sales and revenues by segment, intersegment sales 
and revenues in 2019 , 2018, and 2017 were as follows: agriculture and turf net sales of $34 million, $47 million, and $39 million, construction and forestry net sales of $1 million, none, and $1 million, and financial services revenues of $348 million, $308 million, and $244 million, respectively.

31. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
A quarterly dividend of  $.76 per share was declared at the Board 
of Directors meeting on Dece mber 4, 2019, payable on 
February 10, 2020 to stockholders of record on December 31, 
2019. 
In December 2019, the Board of Directors also authorized the 
repurchase of up to $8,000 mill ion of additional common stock. 
This repurchase program will supplement the existing $8,000 
million share repurchase progra m, which had $1,075 million 
remaining at November 3, 2019. Repurchases of the company‚Äôs 
common stock will be made at th e company‚Äôs discretion in the 
open market. 
In November 2019, the company‚Äôs financial services operations 
entered into a retail note securitization using its bank conduit facility that resulted in securitization borrowings of 
approximately $760 million. 
During the first quarter of 2020, the company announced a 
broad voluntary employee-separa tion program that continues 
the efforts to create a more effi cient organization structure and 
reduce operating costs. The program will provide for cash 
payments based on years of serv ice. The expenses will generally 
be recorded in the period the em ployees irrevocably accept the 
separation offer, which is expect ed to be primarily in the first 
quarter of 2020. The program‚Äô s total pretax expenses are 
estimated to be about $120 millio n with annual savings of about 
$90 million
