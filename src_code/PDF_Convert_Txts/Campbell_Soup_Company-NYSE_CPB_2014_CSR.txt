2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORTAs a leader in the food and beverage industry, Campbell is 
demonstrating our steadfast commitment to making good, 
honest food for the people who live, work and eat in our 
communities, while implementing our Strategic Framework 
to build shareholder value by driving sustainable profitable 
net sales growth.
This Corporate Social Responsibility Report outlines 
Campbell’s progress in Fiscal 2013 as we continued to 
advance our 2020 Agenda, which established our CSR imperatives and four Sustainability and Corporate 
Citizenship goals:
• Cut the environmental footprint of our product portfolio in half, as measured by water consumption and green-
house gas emissions per tonne of product produced;
• Measurably improve the health of young people in our hometown communities;
• Continue to provide consumers with nutrition and wellness choices in our product portfolio; and
• Leverage CSR and Sustainability as key drivers of 
employee engagement and performance in our culture. 
As you will see in this report, Campbell has made significant 
progress toward these goals, which we announced in 2010.
On the environmental front, we’re conserving the Earth’s 
resources for future generations. In Fiscal 2013, Campbell:
• Reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 4.4 percent,  
or more than 20,800 metric tonnes;
• Reduced water consumption by 2.6 percent per tonne  
of food produced; and
• Achieved a waste recycling rate of 83.2 percent worldwide. We also initiated renewable energy projects and continued to streamline packaging, with a cumulative reduction of more than 65 million pounds in our product portfolio over 
the last five years.
To improve the health of young people, we applied our 
expertise in nutrition and well-being to combat childhood 
obesity and hunger in communities like our hometown of 
Camden, New Jersey. Our ongoing Campbell Healthy 
Communities program is a $10 million, 10-year initiative 
that is promoting better nutrition, physical fitness and access to healthier foods for children in Camden, a city 
where many families are living in poverty.
We enhanced the health and wellness profile of our portfolio 
in Fiscal 2013 by acquiring two businesses in new categories: 
Bolthouse Farms, a leading maker of fresh carrots, packaged 
fresh juices and refrigerated salad dressings; and Plum 
Organics, a leading brand of organic baby food and simple 
meals for children.Dear Campbell Stakeholders,

LEADERSHIP  |  42014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORTAt the same time, Campbell continued to integrate our 
CSR imperatives into our operations around the world. 
We’ve brought corporate social responsibility into our executive compensation system and included important 
metrics on energy, water, waste, safety and ethics. 
In the communities where we operate, Campbell’s  
commitment to social responsibility included providing 
more than $50 million in food donations and global giving 
during the year. The Campbell Soup Foundation provided 
more than $1.7 million in grants to nonprofit community 
service organizations, with more than half dedicated to 
agencies serving Camden.
But our most inspiring achievement isn’t measured in 
dollars — it is the spirit of our employees, who volunteered more than 21,000 hours last year to enhance the quality of 
people’s lives. During Campbell’s annual Make a Difference 
Week, more than 3,600 employees across 16 of our U.S. 
locations participated in 90 projects that focused on build-
ing and sustaining healthy communities. I invite you to learn more about Campbell’s progress by reading this CSR report. I also encourage you to share your 
views with us at csr_feedback@campbellsoup.com because your opinion matters at Campbell. Our Company continued 
to grow in Fiscal 2013 and stayed true to our foundation of 
providing great-tasting food made with care, while operating 
with the utmost integrity and transparency.
From the C-suite to the plant floor, Campbell’s people are 
focused on driving sustainable growth and creating shared 
value that benefits our shareholders and the community.
As the leader of Campbell, I believe that we can make a 
profit and make a difference. It has been our legacy for  
145 years and it is our future.
Best,
Denise M. Morrison

Corporate Governance
Accountability at the Highest Level 
Campbell’s commitment to responsible 
corporate citizenship and a sustainable 
business model begins with our Board of 
Directors. Consisting of 14 independent 
members and one executive director, our 
Board has long been led by an indepen-dent, non-executive chairman. All our 
directors stand for election annually. 
Our goals are reflected in our Corporate 
Governance Standards, which are evalu-
ated annually with systematic procedures 
in place for assessing the effectiveness of the Board and Board committees.
In FY2013, the full Board convened eight 
times, the four standing committees met 
a total of 30 times and all directors 
attended at least 75 percent of sched-
uled Board meetings and the sessions 
of the committees on which they served. 
A segment of every Board meeting was allocated exclusively for the directors 
to confer on relevant issues without 
the participation of management.Diverse Board MakeupThe diversity of our directors’ perspectives 
and experiences contributes exponentially 
to sound corporate governance. Our 
current Board includes five women, 
two African Americans, a director from India and a director born and raised in 
Argentina. Our directors represent a 
cross-section of industries, including 
the food industry, consumer products, 
financial services, retail, packaging, 
finance and international businesses. 
Responsibilities
The Board focuses on areas that are 
important to shareholders, such as 
strategy, leadership development, direc-
tor recruitment, external development 
and executive compensation. Directors 
have numerous opportunities to interact 
with individual members of Campbell’s 
senior management team, including periodic visits to plant facilities to 
assess operations and gain additional 
insights into the Company’s business.

The Campbell Board is also extremely focused on enterprise 
risk management and has a framework in place that helps 
assign specific accountabilities to the Board. The responsi-
bilities reflected in the framework are included in meeting 
agendas for the Board and its committees, with the Audit 
Committee reviewing the entire framework annually.
Risk Management Process
Campbell has an extensive Risk and Crisis Management 
system in place, with the Senior Vice President and Chief Legal and Public Affairs Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer heading the function. They report directly to the 
CEO. Additionally, the Vice President of Environmental 
Programs and the Vice President of Public Affairs and 
Corporate Responsibility present the Company’s progress 
and status regarding environmental sustainability to the 
Audit Committee and Board of Directors annually, focusing 
on the Company’s progress on energy use, greenhouse gas 
emissions, energy conservation projects, water use, waste-water treatment and solid waste recycling, and further, how 
these efforts are impacting climate change.

Recognition
Acknowledgment of our Strategy and Strong Results
We are proud of the work we have done 
in the area of CSR and sustainability, and 
are honored to receive acknowledgment 
and other forms of recognition from cred-
ible external stakeholders. The following 
include just some of the recognition we have received for our efforts in the 
past year.
Global 100 Most Sustainable 
Corporations in the World 
Campbell was named to the Global 100 
Most Sustainable Corporations in the World by Corporate Knights, a media and 
investment research company. The top 100 
corporations are selected based on sus-
tainability disclosure practices, financial 
health and indicators such as energy 
and water use, waste management and 
community engagement. Campbell was 
the only U.S. food and beverage company 
named — and one of only 10 U.S. companies overall to make the top 100 in 2013. 
Dow Jones Sustainability Indices Campbell was named to the 2013/2014 
Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI). 
This is the fifth year Campbell was named 
to the North America index and the fourth 
year our Company was named to the 
World index. The DJSI was launched in 
1999 and represents the top 10 percent 
of the world’s largest companies in terms 
of CSR and sustainability performance. Campbell also received the Bronze Class 
distinction for our excellent sustainability 
performance for the past two years. 
Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine’s 100 Best 
Corporate Citizens For the third consecutive 
year, Campbell placed among the Top 10 of all large-cap Russell 1000 companies on CR Magazine’s annual 100 Best 
Corporate Citizens List, regarded as the 
top corporate responsibility ranking 
based on publicly available information. 
Campbell also ranked number-one in 
the Consumer Staples Sector for the 
third straight year. 
Civic 50 Campbell was named  
one of the top 10 most community-minded com-
panies in America by the Civic 50, a national initiative recognizing S&P 500 
companies that demonstrate leadership 
and investment in civic engagement. The 
survey is the first of its kind to implement 
a scientific approach to measuring and evaluating corporate civic engagement; it 
ranks companies on community leader-
ship, strategy, measurement, transparency, 
partnerships, cause alignment and 
employee civic health.

DuPont Award for Packaging Innovation 
Both Campbell and our Pepperidge Farm 
business were honored with one of the 
packaging industry’s most prestigious 
awards. Campbell’s Go soup was recog-
nized for innovative packaging design, sustainability  
and waste reduction.
National Business Group on Health for  
Promoting Employee Wellness 
Campbell was among 65 U.S. employers 
that received the 2013 Best Employers for 
Healthy Lifestyles award at the Leadership 
Summit sponsored by the National Business Group on Health’s Institute on Innovation in Workforce Well-being.

independent, worldwide association of 30,000 prominent 
senior executives. The award was established in 1991 and 
receives more than 1,000 entries from 25 different countries 
each year. 
Produce for Better Health Role Model
Campbell was a 2013 Role Model award recipient for the Produce for Better Health’s highest level of recognition. This 
recognition is a result of our many efforts such as social media 
campaigns and other communications to help increase fruit 
and vegetable consumption and raise awareness of Produce 
for Better Health efforts.
2013 CPG Award for  Innovation and Creativity 
Campbell was honored with the prestigious CPG Award for Innovation and Creativity by the Grocery Manufacturers 
Association and its Associate Member Council for Just Peachy  
salsa, an original product developed using discarded, but edible, peaches. The creation of Just Peachy saved local 
farmers landfill discard costs and supported the Food Bank of South Jersey’s hunger relief programs, which received 
100 percent of the profits from the sale of the product.
Vigeo US 50 and Vigeo World 120 Campbell was included in the newly 
launched Vigeo 50 index and Vigeo 
World 120 index. These socially responsible investing indices were launched by NYSE Euronext (NYX), the world’s largest 
exchange group, and Vigeo, the leading European expert in 
assessing responsible performance to promote and support 
responsible investment. Campbell was one of only 38 North 
American companies and one of only three food manufac-
turers included in the Vigeo 120 World index. 
Human Rights Campaign 2014 Corporate Equality Index
Campbell was proud to receive a perfect score of 100 percent on the 2014 Corporate Equality Index (CEI), a national bench-
marking survey and report on corporate policies and practices 
related to LGBT workplace equality, administered by the 
Human Rights Campaign Foundation. The 2014 CEI rated 934 
businesses in their report, which focuses on non-discrimination 
workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-  
inclusive health care benefits, competency programs, and 
public engagement with the LGBT community. Campbell’s 
efforts in satisfying all of the CEI’s criteria resulted in a 
100 percent ranking and the designation as a Best Place 
to Work for LGBT Equality.

2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
"Sometimes the past can pave 
the way for the future," says 
Campbell’s Corporate Archivist 
Jonathan Thorn. “We’re trying 
to utilize our long history as we 
focus on the path ahead — to 
look at our previous successes 
and failures to gain additional 
perspective on what we’re 
doing today.”
A librarian by training, Jonathan worked in a variety of libraries and archives before coming to Campbell, including 
the University of North Texas Music Library. He also worked on 
special projects for the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian 
Institution and other cultural institutions. Although he 
developed expertise in managing audiovisual collections, 
Jonathan wanted to return to his original passion — archival 
and special collections work. 
The opportunity to join Campbell was too good to pass up. 
Corporate archivists are somewhat rare; it’s estimated that 
less than 2 percent of consumer goods companies have such 
a position. Campbell has maintained a formal corporate 
archive since the mid-1980s, recognizing that the Company 
has long been the source of iconic brands that resonate 
with consumers — particularly in America. 
“That heritage is very valuable to us as a company, for  
a lot of reasons,” explains Jonathan. “It helps us tell the 
story of Campbell, our brands, and helps us connect with 
consumers. We also use our history to protect our reputa-
tion and intellectual property.” 
Jonathan uses Campbell’s history in a variety of ways. 
Business and consumer cycles often go in waves, so it’s 
possible to draw parallels between different periods in the Company’s history. Understanding Campbell’s past is one 
way of evaluating what could possibly happen in the future. 
"The economic downturn that began in 2008 offered a 
prime example, with obvious parallels to the 1930s. The 
Great Depression in the 1930s hit Campbell hard," Jonathan 
observes. Not only was the Company in the midst of a 
worldwide economic crisis, but John Dorrance, the Company 
president and the chemist who invented the process to make condensed soup, died in 1930, leaving brother Arthur to take the reins. 
“One of the things Arthur Dorrance did amid depressed 
conditions and fierce competition in the 1930s was to con-
tinue increasing product quality, keep prices the same, and 
start innovating with new products,” explains Jonathan. 
“That’s very similar to what we’ve done through the current 
economic crisis — we’ve maintained quality and driven 
innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers, but kept pricing at an affordable level.” 
Protecting Campbell’s intellectual property is another area 
where Jonathan often lends his expertise. “If we have a 
trademark or claim challenged, as an archivist I help defend 
the Company's brands by using primary sources to verify the 
existence of our intellectual property, or to demonstrate 
how a product has been marketed to consumers over time.”
Jonathan’s other tasks include tapping into Campbell history 
for marketing purposes, or assisting with external commu-
nications efforts. Many of the Company's archived materials 
are truly unique, such as John Dorrance’s notebooks containing 
the original condensed soup formulas that made Campbell a 
successful business, and correspondence and reports written 
in Joseph Campbell’s own hand. Others help tell the broader 
Campbell story — about our longstanding connection to the 
communities in which we’re located, particularly Camden; our work packing rations for soldiers during World Wars I and II; 
and our establishment of an employee credit union in 1937. 
For Jonathan, these materials collectively tell the story of a 
company that has thrived for almost a century and a half 
because it’s been committed to quality, operated with integ-
rity and stayed true to its employees and its consumers.
It’s an impressive record, and one that’s about to become 
even more accessible. In January 2013, Jonathan finished 
cataloging the remaining Pepperidge Farm archival materials 
and continues to make more of our physical materials 
available using digital tools.
“It’s another way we’re trying to leverage Campbell’s rich and 
wonderful story — both internally, to our own employees, and 
externally to our consumers.”

CSR at Campbell: Promoting global nutrition and wellness  
while building a sustainable environment and honoring our  
role in society from farm to the family.
This report is the latest segment of a 
conversation that began 145 years ago, 
when our Company’s founders first started 
canning quality vegetables and soups 
from a small warehouse in Camden, New 
Jersey. Today, reporting is but one element of a much richer conversation among our 
employees, customers, consumers — and 
everyone else connected with Campbell 
Soup Company and our family of brands 
— about the role of a food and beverage 
company in our society — its impact, 
contributions and obligations.
We know not to be reactive, but  
strategically proactive. With multiple 
new trends emerging almost daily, 
responsible corporate behavior at its 
core has focused on accountability, 
transparency and engagement. For 
companies in the food and beverage 
sector, however, there are a number of additional dynamics that contribute to 
the overall picture. Some issues are 
unique to our sector, such as sustainable 
agriculture, responsible sourcing, promo-
tion of human health and sound nutrition, 
and responsiveness to consumers’ 
ever-changing expectations of the foods 
they choose for themselves and their 
families. At Campbell, we strive to address each of these issues through a life cycle 
lens — from start to end.Defining Context
Because CSR and sustainability have 
different definitions among different 
stakeholders, it is important to provide 
some context on how we view these 
terms at Campbell. At the core, CSR  
and sustainability at Campbell Soup 
Company mean:
• Advancing global nutrition and wellness;
• Helping build a more sustainable environment; and
• Honoring our role in society, from 
the farm to the family.
More broadly, we believe corporate 
social responsibility and sustainability 
are integrated business platforms that 
build long-term shareholder value. 
These platforms foster innovation, 
drive operational efficiency, improve 
environmental performance, reduce costs, strengthen our employees’ relationships 
with our customers and ultimately create 
business advantage.
We expect our Company to be judged 
not only on its financial performance, 
but also on its commitment to CSR and 
sustainability. We believe firmly that our 
consumers, customers, employees and investors expect no less from us as we 
head into a time of fewer resources 
and multiple challenges. We believe 
the importance of this commitment will only increase.

Management Strategy and Analysis
Thinking Big, Acting Bold
How are we moving ahead at Campbell? By building on 
our strengths as a food industry leader, thinking BIG and 
taking BOLD action to reshape our Company and our role 
in a changing world. Our optimism about the future is an 
incredible motivation; informing our decision-making, as 
well as inspiring us to produce high-quality, wholesome 
products that are trusted the world over and to make a positive difference in the world we live in. In keeping with our Company mission, we continually look to making our 
world’s future more nourished and sustainable. To honor that, we have reinforced new strategic business drivers. 
Campbell will be:
A More Innovative Company
We will be critically focused on consumer-driven innovation 
in products and packaging as the primary driver of 
organic growth.
A More Balanced Company
We will drive our Company’s growth by providing a wide 
array of delicious, nutritious and convenient products across a growing consumer base.
A More Responsive Company
We will be far better positioned for engagement with new 
and growing consumer groups.
Our cultural focus is summed up in Our Leadership Model, 
which inspires us to build a safe, diverse, inclusive, engaged 
and responsible company that conducts business and delivers strong results with the highest standards of integrity.
Defining CSR and Sustainability Strategy
Each year, we conduct a formal strategic planning process 
in which we reassess and refine our core strategies includ-
ing CSR, sustainability and community affairs. At Campbell, 
these are platforms that are incorporated into key business and 
functional-unit strategic plans and annual performance goals 
that then lead to executive and personal performance objectives.Our strategic planning process begins with a broad situation assessment, where we examine our key internal and external 
drivers and challenges to our CSR and sustainability strategy, 
including, but not limited to, key trends in sustainability 
and the evolving expectations of our stakeholders. Our strate-
gic plan for CSR and sustainability rests on four key pillars:
• Nourishing Our Planet: Environmental stewardship
• Nourishing Our Consumers: Our interactions with  customers and consumers
• Nourishing Our Neighbors: Community service
• Nourishing Our Employees: Building a  
high-performance workplace
As part of our annual situation assessment, we not only 
review our performance in each of these areas, but also take 
into consideration external trends and drivers in the market-
place, and our stakeholders, through a multifaceted lens. We 
analyze a matrix of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and 
threats to help us fine-tune our goals, strategies and opera-
tional priorities in each of our four primary CSR platforms.
This process of self-evaluation and critical introspection 
helped us identify several characteristics that are important 
to long-term success. These include:
• A shared perspective on CSR across the Company;
• Definition of core metrics and long-term performance 
goals; and
• Recognition that our executives and employees must have the necessary resources and tools to activate 
our strategy.
We declared that our strategy should provide for active stakeholder engagement; that our practices, performance 
and results be transparent; and, most importantly, that our 
efforts be shaped by a focus that is unique to Campbell 
and the impact we can have.

CSR Governance
A Formal and Effective CSR and  
Sustainability Governance Structure
We understand that one of the most 
important factors in executing a successful 
CSR strategy is ensuring that an effective 
governance structure is in place. In the 
five years of our formalized CSR and 
sustainability program, we have contin-uously made improvements to ensure 
that we have the resources necessary 
to make efficient decisions, establish 
accountabilities and drive execution of 
the CSR and sustainability strategies. 
This structure begins with the support 
of the CEO and includes oversight by the Board of Directors. 
The CSR Steering Committee is led by the 
CEO and is composed of senior executives 
of the Company’s largest businesses and 
corporate functions, including Finance, 
Human Resources, Supply Chain, Legal, 
Research & Development, Public Affairs 
and Information Technology. The CEO receives quarterly briefings on CSR and 
sustainability performance as well as a 
review of external and industry stake-
holder issues. The Steering Committee 
is made aware of and provides input to 
the strategic plan for the CSR, sustain-
ability and community affairs functions. 
Periodic updates on the Company’s CSR 
and sustainability strategy, as well as topic briefings, are also provided to the 
Board of Directors throughout the year.In addition, the Sustainability Leadership 
Team was chartered to define and 
review the sustainability strategy. This 
cross-functional team, led by the Senior 
Vice President Global Supply Chain, Vice 
President Engineering and Infrastructure, and the Vice President of Public Affairs 
and Corporate Responsibility, includes 
leaders in Sustainable Agriculture, Global 
Engineering, Global Procurement, Logistics, 
Legal and Research & Development, and 
meets regularly to review the performance 
in each of the areas.
The key to successful implementation of 
our strategies is through our passionate 
employees whose engagement and 
enthusiasm provide the core elements 
needed to embed corporate responsibil-
ity and sustainability into the culture of 
our Company. Through participation in our 
volunteer programs, the employee-led Sustainability Network and our plants’ 
green teams, our employees leverage 
the necessary components to bring our 
CSR and sustainability strategy to life.

Key Impacts &  
Opportunities
Identifying Our Impact Across The Value Chain
Campbell’s business and family of brands have multiple impacts within and across their product life cycle from farm to 
fork. As a food and beverage company, our ingredients are grown on farms and are inherently renewable, but how we 
manage these resources today and in the future is critical.
From agriculture and resource management to product innovation, nutrition and packaging, and extending to distribution 
and consumption, we impact our employees, the communities in which we live and work, our customers, consumers and 
suppliers, and a wide range of other stakeholders that interact with our people and products. We look at every step in our 
operations and every personal interaction as an opportunity to advance our performance and benefit consumers and society.

Stakeholder 
Engagement
Engaging Stakeholders in Business Strategy
One of the key elements to a successful 
CSR strategy is true engagement with a 
variety of stakeholders. This engagement 
must be proactive and requires a mindset 
that treats stakeholder issues and concerns 
as topics that merit dialogue. These stake-holder perspectives inform the Company’s 
overall CSR and sustainability strategy. At 
Campbell, we recognize the importance 
of having a well-developed stakeholder 
strategy that encompasses a diverse 
spectrum of stakeholders, both internal 
and external, and engages them in a way to help create a competitive advan-
tage. We do this through a variety of 
approaches designed to gather varied 
perspectives on our business activities. 
We use a three-pronged approach to 
stakeholder engagement:
Identify: We use a variety of mechanisms 
to identify the issues that are important to our stakeholders. In addition to direct 
engagement, surveys and social media, we 
also work with third-party consumer and 
customer research firms, our Consumer 
and Customer Insights and Consumer 
Affairs departments, and our Customer 
Relationship Managers to identify the 
priorities of our marketplace stakeholders.
Set Processes: We employ several  
specific processes to engage suppliers, 
employees, investors and external thought 
leaders in a range of topics, including 
health and nutrition, food safety and 
quality, environmental stewardship, 
community relations, and diversity  
and inclusion.Benchmarking: We conduct benchmarking for leadership performance within and 
outside our sector and interact with many 
trade and issue management groups 
worldwide. We conduct specific surveys 
on CSR and sustainability with consumers, suppliers and community stakeholders. 
We also collaborate with many of our 
suppliers to identify synergies where 
we can work together to reach com-
mon goals in CSR and sustainability. 
Direct Market Feedback
As part of our stakeholder engagement 
process this past year, we performed an 
in-depth research project with more 
than 900 consumers. Our goal was to 
continually improve our understanding 
of how consumers both think and feel 
about Campbell. We continue to learn 
from our research and factor these inputs 
into our evolving materiality assessment.  
This research revealed some key drivers 
that consumers believe are important to 
build trust. The consumers indicated that 
a trustworthy company is one that:
• Provides top-quality products 
• Is responsive to their needs 
• Continually strives to make  products healthier 
• Delivers what they promise
• Really cares about people — not  just profits 
• Is caring and nurturing 
• Is socially responsible 
• Manufactures products in an  environmentally friendly way 
• Is known for food safety 
• Hires employees that are devoted  
to consumers

Campbell’s strongest anchor perceptions with our consumers 
were characterized as familiar, trustworthy, inspiring and 
knowledgeable. We want to continue to build those feelings 
among our stakeholders as we leverage CSR and sustainability 
to help drive continued innovation. 
We know that simply engaging with our stakeholders is 
not enough. Once we have identified the issues that are important to both Campbell and our stakeholders, we must 
respond to those issues through a variety of collaborative 
methods. These include public-private partnerships, CEO 
engagement and a scientific advisory panel.
Public-Private Partnerships
Many of Campbell’s business leaders serve as trustees or members of the advisory boards of many organizations 
engaged in the CSR and sustainability agenda, including 
the following:
• Advisory Committee on Supply Chain Competitiveness 
• American College of Nutrition
• American Council for Fitness and Nutrition
• Association for Consumer Research
• Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship
• Center for Food Safety at The University of Georgia
• Congressional Management Foundation
• Convergence Center on Policy Resolution: Project  on Nutrition & Wellness
• Corporate Responsibility Association
• ChildObesity 180
• Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network
• Food Allergy Research and Resource Program
• Food Bank of South Jersey
• Food for All
• Foundation for Strategic Sourcing
• Graham Sustainability Institute at the University  of Michigan• Net Impact
• New Jersey Agricultural Society
• Philabundance
• Produce for Better Health Foundation
• Society of Consumer Affairs Professionals (SOCAP)
• United Way local chapters
• USDA-USTR Agricultural Technical Advisory Committee for Trade in Processed Foods
CEO Engagement Campbell President and CEO Denise Morrison was a founding 
member of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation, an 
initiative of manufacturers and retailers to combat obesity 
in the marketplace, workplace and schools. She also serves 
on the board of the Grocery Manufacturers Association, 
where she chaired its Health and Wellness Committee. She 
is currently Vice Chair of the Consumer Goods Forum. 
Scientific Advisory Panel
Campbell is leveraging a scientific advisory panel made up of 
experts in nutrition and food science from leading universities 
in the U.S. and Europe to provide external perspective on 
plant-based nutrition (e.g. , vegetables, grains, fruits, spices). 
The panel has been designed to provide strategic insights 
on current and emerging science around plants, including 
their nutrient/phytochemical composition and potential 
health benefits that could be derived from these ingredients 
and compounds.
The panel also provides valuable perspective on how  
formulation and processing can be utilized to optimize 
health benefits and create products with consumer appeal, 
interacting directly with senior executives biannually for 
specific initiatives.
Stakeholder Engagement Continued
(continued)“As investors focused on long-term sustainability, ICCR [Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility] members have met with Campbell for over a decade on social and environmental issues, challenging the Company to take leadership positions on water scarcity, sustainable agriculture and access to nutrition. We see continued improvement 
in its risk assessments, disclosures and management plans on these issues. Earlier this year, Campbell showed 
great leadership in adopting a formal Human Right to Water Policy as a direct outcome of our shareholder 
engagement. This policy recognizes the importance of good water stewardship, not only for the long-term growth 
of Campbell’s business, but for the social and environmental sustainability of the communities where it operates. 
Investors view these examples of corporate responsibility as important models for peers in the food sector.”

Materiality Analysis
Examining a Multitude of Issues to Shape  
CSR and Sustainability Programs
The foundation of our approach to our CSR 
and sustainability strategy is our materiality 
assessment, which we have continued to 
refine in recent years. We recognize that 
we cannot progress toward our goals 
alone, but need consistently to engage in an ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders 
and prioritize the issues that are aligned 
with marketplace and stakeholder priorities.
According to the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI), material issues are those that “have 
a direct or indirect impact on an organiza-tion’s ability to create, preserve or erode 
economic, environmental, and social value 
for itself, its stakeholders, and society  
at large.” Consistent with this definition,  
we take an approach to materiality that encompasses proactive stakeholder 
feedback, strategy review and an analysis 
of emerging issues that allows us to 
determine which areas align with  
marketplace and stakeholder priorities.
There are many areas in which Campbell’s 
long-term business success aligns with 
marketplace and stakeholder priorities. 
While most of these materiality issues 
remain relatively stable over time, each 
year we conduct rigorous efforts to inform 
and refine our CSR materiality assessment. In 2013, for example, we performed 
in-depth research with more than 900 
consumers in order to improve our under-
standing of how consumers think and 
feel about Campbell. This analysis showed 
that consumers view our Company as familiar, trustworthy, inspiring and 
knowledgeable.
This result, as well as other stakeholder 
engagement and materiality assessment 
tools, continue to identify and validate seven opportunities around which to 
orient our CSR strategy and reporting:
• Culture and Ethics: Our employees are key stakeholders, so ensuring a 
safe, diverse and ethical workplace 
that nurtures high performance is a 
critical element to our success.
• Food Safety & Quality: Our customers 
and consumers demand safe, high- 
quality food products, so food safety 
is paramount at Campbell. We are 
committed to utilizing high-quality 
ingredients and stringent manufactur-
ing procedures to create the products 
they want.
• Nutrition and Awareness: Our  
consumers seek nutritious and affordable food choices. We strive to 
meet this need by providing a port-
folio of products that satisfy a variety 
of consumer needs.
• Healthier Communities: The health and 
well-being of communities in which 
we live and operate is paramount to 
our success. We engage with commu-nity members and organizations to 
support programming that provides 
positive impacts on youth and 
improves the health of young  
people in those communities.

Public Policy
A Commitment to Dialogue, Disclosure and  
Accountability on Regulatory Issues
Campbell participates actively in the 
discussion of local, state, national and 
international public policy issues that are 
relevant to our business strategies and 
operations, from food safety and advertis-
ing to health care and international trade. We also contribute to public dialogue on 
policy issues through our memberships in 
food and related industry trade associations. 
Committed to industry-wide transparency, 
we emphasize candid dialogue and open 
interactions with government agencies 
and officials. 
Campbell’s U.S. lobbying disclosure 
reports are filed with the appropriate 
state and federal authorities under the 
U.S. Lobby Disclosure Act. We also file 
disclosure reports with the Election Law 
Enforcement Commission for lobbying 
activity with the State of New Jersey. 
Campbell has a formal set of Political Accountability Guidelines and related 
disclosures, which are available on the 
Company’s public website.
In the U.S., Campbell does not endorse 
any individual political party or candidate, 
but we do encourage voluntary political 
activity by our employees. Our employees 
can contribute funds to political candi-dates and organizations engaged in  
policy issues that are important to our Company, such as food manufacturing 
standards and worker safety, through 
Campbell’s Political Action Committee (PAC), a segregated fund that is affiliated with the Company. Contributions made by 
the Campbell PAC are publicly reported, 
in accordance with federal law. To view 
Campbell PAC’s disclosures of contribu-
tions and expenditures to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), visit the 
FEC website.

2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Perhaps no Campbell location has 
made sustainability more of its 
everyday business than our 
processing plant in Napoleon, 
Ohio. From improving farmland 
drainage in the Maumee River 
watershed to harnessing renew -
able energy from 60 acres of solar panels, our largest U.S. processing 
plant hasn’t just embraced 
sustainability — it’s living it. 
“Our goal is to put sustainability on par with the products we 
create,” says Randy Puckett, Manager of Services & Utilities at 
Napoleon. “Our food nourishes people. Napoleon’s sustainability 
commitment helps nourish our business, our employees and 
our broader community.” 
Napoleon’s sustainability efforts are expected to expand  
in 2014, with a new anaerobic digester that went live in 
December 2013 and an enhanced recycling program that will 
push it closer to exceeding its target goal — several years 
ahead of schedule.
The flagship project for Napoleon is an anaerobic digester, or 
biogas facility constructed directly across the street from the 
plant. This project is a partnership between Campbell and CH4 
Biogas — a leader in renewable energy projects. It will create 
electricity for Napoleon by using the facility’s own waste. At 
full operation, as much as 50 percent of Napoleon’s waste could be diverted from local landfills into renewable energy. Pipes 
will transport Napoleon’s waste products — such as plant and 
food waste or wastewater sludge —into the biogas facility. That 
material goes into a large storage tank where it will break down 
naturally over time. The methane gas produced from this 
“digestion” process is then captured and returned to Campbell’s 
property, to a set of generators that will create electricity to 
power Napoleon’s West Plant. In this way, the energy required 
to produce a new can of soup or a beverage will have been 
provided, in part, by the product that came before it. It is 
anticipated that 40 percent of the West Plant’s energy will be 
provided by electricity generated through the digester project.
“The anaerobic digester came fully online on December 23, 
2013,” notes Puckett, “and allows us to reduce our long-term 
energy costs while also reducing waste disposal costs and increasing recycling rates.” The partnership between Campbell and CH4 is expected to stabilize the cost of Napoleon’s electricity 
for the next 20 years, and when energy sourced from the plant’s 
solar panels is included, about 40 percent of energy used at 
Napoleon will eventually come from renewable sources. 
Biogas is just one way the Napoleon facility has become a model 
of sustainability. Recycling is yet another area where it has 
excelled. Today, the facility recycles 89 percent of its waste, about 
a third more than in 2008. The goal is to exceed 95 percent 
by 2020. As an efficient recycling program is already in place, achieving the next 6 percent will take some of Napoleon’s 
hardest work yet. “Our current recycling program works well — we are focused on making it work even better,” noted Puckett. 
Source separation is a big part of the answer. “We picked the 
low-hanging fruit available for recycling. An effective source 
separation program will allow us to capture that last 2 or 3 
percent of waste that is not currently being recycled. Ideally, 
we’d like to be a 100 percent landfill-free facility.” 
With a plant that already collects such diverse materials as used 
rubber boots, spent cardboard rolls and bale netting, the key 
goals for Napoleon’s enhanced recycling program is to raise 
employee engagement and awareness about recycling, 
encourage them to own the process and provide them with a 
convenient set of tools and resources that will take the plant’s 
recycling rate to the next level. Education and training for all 
employees, coupled with increased attention to bin locations and 
labeling, will be the focus of Napoleon’s 2014 recycling efforts.
Between ongoing renewable energy and recycling programs, 
there’s quite a bit happening at Napoleon on the sustainability 
front — activity that hasn’t gone unnoticed. The facility was 
nominated for Food Processing magazine’s Green Plant of the 
Year Award and won an inaugural Climate Leadership Award 
(CLA). The CLA recognizes corporate leadership in addressing 
climate change through the control of greenhouse gas emissions, 
yet another focus area for the plant. 
Randy Puckett and the rest of Napoleon aren’t yet ready to 
rest on their laurels. “We’re proud of our accomplishments and 
the progress we’ve made toward our 2020 sustainability goals. We believe our focus and dedication to meeting those goals 
gives our plant a competitive advantage while also being 
socially responsible.”

PERFORMANCE  |  30Measuring Progress to Manage Performance 
We know that to have a successful CSR and sustainability 
program, it must be fully integrated across business units, 
functional strategic plans and balanced scorecards. Campbell 
employs a “balanced scorecard” process to define annual 
objectives and measure the performance of the Company 
as a whole, as well as in individual business units. Goals 
defined in the scorecard fall within four key measurement 
areas with respect to the Company’s financial, strategic, 
operational and marketplace objectives. The CSR, sustain-ability and community affairs organization maintains an 
additional corporate balanced scorecard that addresses 
strategic, operational, internal and external metrics. 
Through our balanced scorecard, we assess not only whether 
we achieve our objectives, but also how we achieve them. 
As part of this process, incentive compensation for many 
of the employees, including Campbell executives, is tied to 
CSR and sustainability metrics including ethics and compli-
ance training, safety performance and annual reductions in 
waste, water and energy.Further, CSR and sustainability metrics are included in  
categories across Campbell’s strategic planning process and are cultural components of our individual performance 
objective process. These are the primary tools used to drive 
accountability and judge success on annual performance 
expectations. Objectives range from specific steps in strategy 
development to individual reporting milestones, such as 
establishment of agreed-upon metrics, expansion of com-munity service programs, workplace diversity and inclusion,

Stakeholder engagement, combined with an analysis of

against water pollution.Elizabeth Morrison
Global Director  
Diversity & Inclusion2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORTSECTION  |  40
2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
It makes perfect sense how 
Elizabeth A. Morrison, Campbell’s 
Global Director of Diversity and 
Inclusion, was drawn into her field. 
As an African-American female 
growing up on New York City’s 
Upper West Side, she experi-
enced diversity and inclusion 
(D&I) firsthand. 
“My family was small,” she says, 
“but we were part of a very large and dynamic multicultural 
community, so I just kind of grew up being aware of people’s differences and learning to appreciate them.”
It’s also something of a family business. Elizabeth’s parents were 
both born in Harlem — her father was an attorney, with some 
of his caseload covering civil rights issues, while her mother 
was a case manager for the Office of Aging. So both, in their 
own way, chose careers that found them advocating for 
underserved populations.
Still, Elizabeth’s initial passion was broadcast communications. 
It was her move into a corporate communications role that 
first brought her in contact with D&I issues. 
“From personal experience, I was already aware of many of the 
issues that are at the core of diversity,” Elizabeth says. “Working 
in corporate communications to transform a company’s culture 
and increase employee engagement led me to discover that there was an entire industry based on D&I. People do their best 
work when a company’s culture is dedicated to ensuring others 
are accepted for who they are and feel comfortable bringing 
their authentic selves to the office.”
Her work as a communications professional helped Elizabeth 
identify some of the key factors that drive effective D&I programs. 
Leadership buy-in is critical, but it also takes organizational 
commitment to the business case and an understanding that a 
diverse and inclusive workforce generates the type of creativity 
and innovation that sustains businesses.
Since coming to Campbell in 2012, Elizabeth has been taking  
a fresh look at our programs, developing a strategic plan and 
multimedia communication campaign that will better ingrain 
D&I as part of the Campbell culture. 
“You’ve got to define your goals, communicate effectively on how 
diversity and inclusion drives business results and make sure your 
leaders understand how it will achieve their business goals,” Elizabeth believes. “D&I must be viewed as integral to the sustain-ability of the business, not as a stand-alone objective or a to-do."
A critical element in her efforts has been creating partnerships 
across our various functional businesses units — understanding 
what they do, their goals and needs, and working with them 
to integrate D&I strategy and principles into their own work. 
Additionally, creating open dialogues with departments such 
as Human Resources and Legal ensures that our strategy is 
aligned with the Company’s core processes and policies, a 
factor critical to implementing a successful and sustainable D&I program at Campbell.
Tapping into our Business Resource Affinity Networks (BRANs) 
is another important element. “Where we’ve done some really 
great work is with our BRANs, some of which are almost eight 
years old — so Campbell can be considered a pioneer in leverag-
ing affinity networks to connect with and empower employees.”
Generally used as an outreach, networking and attraction/
retention tool, BRANs have also been actively engaged in 
Campbell's issues as well. Our Hispanic network, for example, 
was tapped to preview and give feedback on a proposed 
television commercial created for Latino consumers. It also 
played a role in our sponsorship of the 2013 Hispanic Choice 
Awards for which Carlos Barroso, our Senior Vice President 
of Research and Development, was a presenter. 
So what’s Elizabeth’s biggest challenge when it comes to D&I? 
It’s getting her audience to make a personal connection.
“Who I am and how I grew up led me to this area of work. If 
someone isn’t coming to the table with their own experience, 
it’s my challenge — it’s Diversity and Inclusion’s challenge —  
to help create some kind of watershed moment to inspire 
understanding and activation,” she says.
But if D&I has its challenges, it also has its rewards.“Despite the challenge of implementing a new strategy, there 
have been a lot of wonderful things about my Campbell journey 
so far. Mostly, it’s the openness, passion and anticipation I’ve 
seen throughout the business for our efforts. I’ve watched our policies begin to take shape, the partnerships start to come 
together and have met many individuals who are natural D&I 
champions. Having leaders who are so passionate about our 
work and people who are so receptive has been the most 
wonderful thing about my time here.”

Nutrition & Awareness: 
Overview
Opportunity: Offer consumers healthy and nutritious food  
products and the knowledge to inform their choices.
At its most fundamental level, the business 
of Campbell is the business of nutrition. 
Campbell employees around the world 
embody our commitment to earn and 
maintain consumers’ trust as one of the 
world’s leading providers of healthy and nutritious foods. For almost a century and 
a half, it’s a job that Campbell has done 
well — growing our worldwide product 
portfolio into one that provides consumers 
with a variety of affordable, nutritious, 
convenient and great-tasting foods. 
Campbell’s results show that consumers 
have responded to the quality of our 
product portfolio. Consider that “healthy 
foods” — i.e ., those foods with nutritional 
profiles satisfying the FDA definition of “healthy” — generated 34 percent of our 
FY2013 U.S. retail sales, or $2.6 billion. 
This is a 49 percent increase in the sales 
of healthy products (which includes new products, increased sales of existing 
products and brand acquisitions) since 
FY2009. During FY2013, $82 million of 
healthy products were sold through our 
Away from Home channels, representing 
12 percent of Away from Home total 
sales. Among the healthy products sold 
were those specifically marketed to K-12 
schools, including our whole grain-rich Pepperidge Farm sweet and savory 
Goldfish crackers and Goldfish bread; our V8 Low Sodium Vegetable juice,  
V8 Splash, and V-Fusion 100% juices; 
Campbell’s Healthy Request soups; and 
Prego Italian sauces. These healthy 
offerings provided menu planning  
solutions for school districts looking to 
implement new USDA standards for 
meals and improved the nutrition of  
a la carte items offered in school cafeterias, while maintaining meal participation.
We continue to grow our better-for-you 
portfolio through ongoing initiatives, new product development and brand acquisi-
tions. Campbell recently welcomed Plum 
Organics and Bolthouse Farms to our 
family of brands, which greatly expands 
our portfolio of nutritious products, 
and — in the case of Bolthouse Farms — 
marks our entry into the “packaged 
fresh” category. 
We also regularly evaluate our portfolio 
of products for the positive nutrition they 
provide to the American diet. Our assess-
ment includes products that limit negative 
nutrients pursuant to FDA requirements 
for “healthy” foods, and that also provide 
at least one-half serving, or one-quarter 
cup, of vegetables, fruits, and/or are a 
good source of fiber, calcium, potassium, iron or Vitamins A or C.

Campbell’s approach to health and 
nutrition is centered on providing consum-
ers with the products and information 
they need to create and maintain a sound 
overall diet. Consumers want to know 
what they’re eating and have a feeling 
of greater control over their health and 
nutrition goals. To help them, Campbell offers hundreds of nutritious products 
that fit in an overall healthy diet that 
can help Americans meet the Dietary 
Guidelines’ recommendations. We offer 
a variety of products that are made with whole grains, are low in fat, saturated 
fat and cholesterol and/or are lower in 
calories and sugar. In the U.S. alone, 
this includes:
• More than 430 products low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol
• More than 450 products with sodium levels at or below 480 mg, the FDA 
level for Healthy claims
• More than 300 products with 100 
or fewer calories per serving 
• More than 100 products certified by the American Heart Association (AHA)Acquisitions Expand Our  
Healthy Portfolio 
A pair of recent acquisitions has further 
expanded our portfolio of healthy and 
nutritious foods. Plum is one of the fastest 
growing baby food companies in the U.S. 
and offers culinary-inspired simple meals 
for infants and toddlers, plus pouch packaging that makes feeding easy. The 
brand’s product line is based on pure, 
fresh and organic ingredients. 
The acquisition of Bolthouse Farms 
marks our first entry into the $12 billion 
“packaged fresh” foods category. The 
company offers growing product lines of 
super-premium fresh-refrigerated bever-
ages, baby carrots and refrigerated salad 
dressings. The combination of Bolthouse 
Farms brand offerings and our iconic V8 
portfolio gives us a $1.2 billion platform 
to offer health-conscious consumers a wide variety of vegetable- and fruit-based 
juices. In addition, Bolthouse Farms is a 
leader in sustainable farming practices 
and will provide enhanced opportunities 
for Campbell to further develop its sus-
tainable agriculture programs.

2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
For Josh Anthony, Campbell’s 
Vice President of Global Health Sciences and Regulatory Affairs, good nutrition started at home as a child. 
“I really became interested in 
nutrition from my mom,” says Josh. “I had allergies and spent a lot of time at the doctor’s office when I was younger. She really 
took it upon herself to dive into nutrition and try to find ways to help me. I was probably having foods like amaranth and kefir before it was really considered cool. On the plus side, I didn’t have too many people trying to steal my lunch.” 
This personal connection continued into Josh’s high school and 
college years when the budding athlete looked to nutrition for a competitive edge. But what he found was a lot of conflicting  
information, or misinformation, starting him down the path of researching nutrition professionally. After studying nutrition and exercise at the University of Illinois, Josh later took his research efforts to the Penn State College of Medicine, where he began looking at the role of proteins and amino acids in supporting muscle growth and development.
When Josh came to Campbell in 2011 to lead our Global Nutrition 
and Health team, he already had several years of academic and industry experience working on nutrition issues. And he joined a company that was already at the forefront of delivering healthy, nutritious foods. With such a strong portfolio, Josh’s task at Campbell was clear. “How do we unlock the inherent benefits of these foods and communicate them to consumers in a powerful way?”
It starts by engaging people in the healthy advantages of Campbell 
products. For example, the Great Shape Yours campaign in January 2013 provided an opportunity to talk about the V8 line of juices and how increased vegetable servings can make for a healthy diet. It’s these types of communication opportunities that drive Josh’s team when they look at the Campbell product line of existing offer-ings and new formulations. Whether supporting our established products, enhancing their nutritional value or demonstrating how Campbell can help consumers live healthier lives, finding the most effective way to reach people has been critical to building awareness of our healthy portfolio. Communication can also be an important factor when driving health through innovation — sometimes tricky in a business in which taste is king. “Combining taste with a scientifically supported benefit can create a delightful experience for the consumer,” says Josh. “Campbell is doing the work and the studies necessary to make these claims responsibly.”
Our expansion of the Campbell's Healthy Request line of soups over 
the past few years is a great example. “With Healthy Request,” he observed, “we’ve found that talking about the benefits of heart health resonates better with consumers than talking about only a product’s attributes, like low sodium.” 
That’s part of the reason why Campbell created our Address Your 
Heart campaign, and why we’ve put emphasis on providing heart-healthy recipe options — both are great ways to connect with consumers about the healthful qualities of our product line. “It’s about meeting the science criteria, but also about giving people solutions through both products and recipes. My team works very closely with our culinary team and our Campbell kitchens to create great, consumer-tested recipes that support a healthy heart and are part of an overall healthy diet.”
So where does Josh see emerging trends in consumer nutrition? 
People are looking for fast benefits, he says, and the growing popular -
ity of energy drinks is a great example. It’s not that consumers aren’t concerned with long-term health, they’re just putting more value on feeling good now. Campbell’s V8 V-Fusion+Energy beverage — high in nutrients, just 50 calories per serving and powered by natural green tea — is a good example of how we’ve responded to this trend.
Josh also feels it’s important to remember that health and wellness 
means different things to different consumers. Some are interested in fruits and vegetables or heart health, while others are concerned with product freshness or gluten-free foods. “Campbell needs suc-cessfully to balance being able to address known health concerns while providing choices for consumers looking for a more holistic health proposition,” he says.
That’s part of the reason Josh is so excited with the recent  
acquisitions of Bolthouse Farms and Plum Organics. Not only do 
these brands add exciting new products to the Campbell portfolio, but they also expand the Company’s nutritional offerings — and their consumer reach. The new companies also bring him back to his childhood. “Personally, for me, these new brands help strengthen our reach to kids — and that’s fun. Exposing kids to nourishing products that also provide some really great flavor exploration helps set them up for long-term health.”

School Nutrition
OPPORTUNITIES  |  45Supporting School Nutrition Programs
Campbell has been a leader in providing 
healthy foods that kids like to eat. During 
FY2013 alone, the Campbell portfolio of 
products promoted to schools included 
more than 50 soup, side dish, sauce and 
100 percent juice options for school food 
service operators. Each of these options 
supplies at least one-quarter cup of vegetables to USDA school meal programs. 
Our iconic Campbell’s Condensed Tomato 
soup, for example, is a popular food 
enjoyed by kids at home and school. One 
8-ounce serving of this healthy food contributes three-fourths of a cup of 
red/orange vegetables to school meals, 
fulfilling the USDA required weekly 
amount for elementary school children. 
Campbell also works with outside  
organizations to promote school nutrition. 
The Alliance for a Healthier Generation 
(AHG), founded by the American Heart Association and the Clinton Foundation, 
works to reduce the prevalence of child-
hood obesity and empower kids to develop 
lifelong healthy habits. The Alliance’s 
Healthy Schools Program has grown to 
become the nation’s most extensive effort 
to prevent childhood obesity in schools 
and now includes more than 20,000 
schools in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. As an AHG 
supporter, Campbell’s voluntary agreement 
with the Alliance to provide healthier 
products to schoolchildren illustrates our 
commitment to fight childhood obesity. 
During FY2013, the portion of the Campbell portfolio promoted to schools 
included 49 choices that meet AHG 
nutrition standards.
Following passage of the Healthy, 
Hunger-Free Kids Act, the USDA issued 
new school meal regulations that became 
effective July 1, 2012. These regulations increased the amount of fruits and veg-
etables to be offered, expanded the 
variety of vegetables included on menus, 
emphasized whole grain-rich foods, 
required low-fat and nonfat milk choices, limited calories and reduced saturated 
fat and sodium levels in school breakfasts 
and lunches. Beginning July 1, 2014, foods 
and beverages sold a la carte in compe-
tition with school meals must also meet 
these new USDA nutrition standards. 
Our continued focus on providing  
consumers with healthy and nutritious 
food choices puts us in an excellent 
position to help schools comply with the 
new regulations. We also reformulated 
some of our products and created new 
meal recipes using our products as 
ingredients specifically to meet the new 
guidelines. For example, during FY2012, 
we introduced two 100 percent whole 
grain Goldfish bread varieties and began reformulating many of our Pepperidge 
Farm Goldfish baked snacks to meet 
USDA’s new criteria for whole grain sweet 
and savory crackers offered in schools.

The New V8: More Innovative, 
More Refreshing
Campbell’s V8 line of beverages 
has long provided consumers with innovative, refreshing ways to get their daily servings of vegetables and fruit. Starting with our iconic V8 100% Vegetable juice, we’ve expanded our offerings to include new and unique flavors that appeal to various taste preferences. With our V-8 V-Fusion Refreshers, we’re offering a lighter, crisper juice bev -
erage that delivers 100 percent of the daily value for Vitamin C with only 100 calories per serving. In addition, the four varieties of V-8 V-Fusion Refreshers are made without high-fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners, or artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.

Changing Products for Changing Consumers
While a good, old-fashioned bowl of 
Campbell’s Tomato soup is a timeless 
classic, today’s increasingly diverse con-
sumers have varied palates. We live in a 
growing food culture where consumers 
seek many different ingredients, flavors and foods that are compatible with their 
preferences and lifestyles, including fresh 
and healthy foods.
Campbell is driving innovation and new 
product development to offer consumers 
a variety of choices to meet their evolving needs. In FY2014, for example, we plan to 
launch more than 200 new products into 
the marketplace — double the number we 
introduced just three years ago. Through 
our acquisitions of Bolthouse Farms 
and Plum Organics, we are offering 
new products that meet the demand 
for packaged fresh food and beverages 
and organic foods for children. 
Campbell is also launching new products 
that we have developed, based on our 
consumer insights, to appeal to new 
demographic groups.  One example is 
Millennials — young adults born after 
1980, who now comprise approximately 
25 percent of the U.S. population. We 
are reaching this consumer group with new products like Campbell’s Go soups, 
which feature bold flavors and micro-
waveable pouch packaging. In addition, Campbell’s commitment to promote and encourage healthy eating 
is often met through products that are 
designed and manufactured to meet 
local or regional tastes, affordability and 
customs. In our major developing markets, including China, Mexico, Malaysia and 
Indonesia, Campbell maintains local 
research and production capabilities. 
Product Formulation
Our Research & Development department 
continually monitors health and nutritional trends in an effort to improve our prod-
ucts, develop new products and better 
meet the needs of consumers. Campbell 
evaluates nutritional opportunities across 
all categories in our global portfolio, looking 
for ways to minimize the negatives — 
saturated fats, sodium and sugar — and 
where possible to enhance the positives 
through additional servings of fruits and vegetables, whole grains or other healthy 
and nutritious ingredients. We also lever-
age emerging science and technologies 
to provide an array of healthful product 
choices. By engaging health and nutrition 
stakeholders, we not only showcase 
Campbell’s range of wholesome products 
but also learn about new scientific 
developments, technologies or health trends that offer opportunities to improve 
the nutritional profile of our products.

soup was enhanced to provide Vitamin D. The soup’s fresh 
mushrooms were exposed to ultraviolet light similar to 
sunlight — a method that increases their Vitamin D content. 
In just a 250-milliliter serving, Canadians can now receive up 
to 25 percent of their daily recommended intake of Vitamin 
D. In FY2012, Campbell Canada also launched three new 
varieties of V8 V-Fusion Smoothies, each containing one 
full serving of vegetables and one full serving of fruit.
Research and Engagement
Campbell has a long history of conducting and supporting 
research focused on advancing better nutrition, food 
preparation and dietary patterns. Using a multidisciplinary 
approach of nutrition, food, sensory, culinary and packaging 
science, we offer consumers healthier choices that meet 
their uncompromising taste expectations. 
In the United States, Campbell sponsors the Academy  
of Nutrition and Dietetics’ annual Food and Nutrition 
Conference & Expo (FNCE). FNCE is the world’s largest 
meeting of food and nutrition experts, attracting more than 
10,000 registered dietitians, nutrition science researchers, 
policymakers, health-care providers and industry leaders. 
FNCE is an opportunity to showcase Campbell’s healthy 
products, recipes, and resources to health professionals 
while providing them with the opportunity to engage in 
productive dialogues with our corporate nutritionists.
Campbell also surveys dietitians annually to collect feedback 
on our products, understand their clients’ consumption and 
referral habits, and hear about the nutritional characteristics 
of products and resources they seek for clients. From these 
surveys, we learned that dietitians prefer coupons as the most 
effective resource in encouraging their clients to try healthy 
products. Sixty percent of those recently surveyed requested 
clinician coupon packs for client distribution. Dietitians also report recipes are an effective way to encourage clients to try 
healthy products. To this end, we distributed nutritious recipe 
booklets at FNCE that featured Campbell’s new recipes — 
those certified by the American Heart Association, as well as other culinary-inspired recipes developed by Campbell 
chefs. With more than 50 percent of nutritionists making 
brand-specific recommendations, these nutrition influencers 
can be instrumental in helping us grow sales of our 
healthy products.
Similarly, Arnott’s helped sponsor the Nutrition Society of 
New Zealand’s Annual Scientific Meeting and used the 
occasion to showcase the company’s Vita-Weat Lunch 
Slices, Arnott’s 100 percent natural crispbread range made with more than 80 percent whole grain ingredients. Arnott’s 
also became a major partner with the Dietitians Association 
of Australia (DAA), the leading organization for dietetic and 
nutritional professionals. Arnott’s involvement helps support 
professional development opportunities for DAA members, 
providing information and research-based resources to 
assist members focused on the health benefits of whole 
grain food choices. Arnott’s sponsorship of the annual DAA 
conference provided a platform to showcase our various whole grain food choices and vegetable juice lines and 
demonstrate to dietitians and health professionals the role 
these products play in helping Australians meet Dietary 
Guidelines. Standing alongside other large food manufac-
turers, our attendance helped to raise awareness of Arnott’s 
commitment to nutrition, encourage dietitians and health 
professionals to be advocates for our Vita-Weat and V8 
brands, and expand our external stakeholder network. 
Ideas for Innovation
An important tool in our efforts to improve the health, 
nutrition and taste of Campbell products is our online 
innovation platform, Ideas for Innovation. Located at  
www.campbellideas.com, the Ideas for Innovation portal, 
which is being upgraded in spring 2014, is a way for employees, 
consumers, customers, suppliers, contractors, inventors and 
friends to share their product ideas with us. Through this Web 
portal, our Research & Development and Marketing personnel receive ideas from a variety of sources on how to improve our 
products (health, nutrition or otherwise), our packaging and 
our production methods.

Awareness
Helping Consumers Get the Facts
The opportunity to offer consumers 
healthy and nutritious food choices 
brings with it a responsibility to help 
increase awareness of these choices.  
We are committed to providing the tools 
and resources consumers need to make informed decisions about health and 
nutrition, and many Campbell products 
carry marks or language assuring that 
they meet specific health criteria. In the 
United States, all products carrying the 
claim “Healthy” must meet the FDA’s 
nutritional criteria for foods that call themselves “healthy.” Similarly, products 
certified by the American Heart Association 
(AHA) prominently display the AHA 
Heart-Check mark on the label, signifying 
that they are appropriate for low-fat, low- 
cholesterol diets that can help prevent 
heart disease. When our products carry 
specific nutritional claims, consumers 
can be assured that the product has met a stringent set of criteria developed by 
outside health and nutrition experts.
Campbell promotes consumer education 
in other ways. With Facts Up Front, for 
example, Campbell worked directly with 
the Grocery Manufacturers Association 
and the Food Marketing Institute to pro-
vide consumers with a voluntary and uniform “front of pack” labeling scheme. 
Through Facts Up Front, Campbell and 
other participating food and beverage 
companies place icons on the front of 
products displaying their calorie count, 
saturated fat, sodium and sugar content 
per serving. Some products may also 
display icons for certain nutrients that 
consumers should be encouraged to add to their diets, such as potassium. Facts Up Front supports the current 
Nutrition Facts Panel appearing on the 
reverse of our products, and is consistent 
with current FDA and USDA food label-
ing regulations. By the end of FY2013, 90 percent of our products displayed 
the Facts Up Front icons. 
The Children’s Food and Beverage 
Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) is another 
industry initiative that Campbell supports. 
CFBAI was launched in 2006 by the Council of Better Business Bureaus and 
a number of food manufacturers, includ-
ing Campbell. The organization’s goal is 
to shift the mix of advertising primarily 
directed to children to encourage healthier 
dietary choices and healthy lifestyles. The 
Initiative also uses nutrition standards 
to govern how and what products are 
advertised to children. 
Online Resources
Our Nutrition Portal  
(www.campbellnutrition.com) is a web-
site for consumers that offers nutrition 
information for Campbell products and 
helps visitors identify products that 
meet their unique health and lifestyle 
needs. 
The site is organized into areas that help 
consumers make choices that align with 
the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans: 
Weight Management, Heart Health, 
Vegetables & Fruits and Grains & Fiber. 
This easy-to-navigate site offers robust 
search functionality that helps consumers

well as receive our monthly e-newsletter.
Connecting with Consumers
Campbell actively seeks and values  
consumer feedback. Last year, nearly 
350,000 consumers in the U.S. and 
Canada contacted us to ask questions, 
express concerns or praise our products. 
Most of these conversations occurred 
through our toll-free telephone number 
and the rest were through letters, emails 
and social media engagement. 
Our dedicated Consumer Affairs team 
receives, tracks, analyzes and responds 
to every single contact. We also encour-
age consumers that call us to participate 
in a short survey about their experience. 
This thorough understanding of consumers’ 
needs and expectations helps us improve 
our products, packaging, production 
processes and level of service.Campbell CaresOne of the best ways to learn whether 
our consumers are satisfied is simply to ask them. That’s why we also reach out to 
them through surveys and other research. 
We constantly challenge ourselves to 
find innovative ways to meet or exceed 
consumer expectations — such as  
managing multiple Campbell-related Facebook pages and communicating 
with consumers via our Twitter feed (@CampbellCares) and Chat with Us 
features available on our corporate

Helping to Provide Societal Solutions
Our focus on providing consumers with 
fruits, vegetables and whole grains is 
not only about offering more nutritional 
choices; it is also about helping them 
construct diets that can meet their nutrition 
and health goals and address health con-cerns, such as obesity and heart disease. 
Obesity is a growing global health  
problem. The keys to maintaining a 
healthy weight include exercise and 
strategies such as portion and calorie 
control. Research suggests that eating foods like fruits, vegetables or soup, 
which can be high in water and fiber, 
can help consumers feel more satisfied 
on fewer calories. 
At Campbell, our commitment goes 
beyond making healthy and nutritious 
products — we also participate in programs 
that aim to eliminate childhood obesity through better eating habits and regular 
exercise. We were a founding member 
of the Healthy Weight Commitment 
Foundation, a national, multiyear effort 
designed to help reduce obesity — in 
particular childhood obesity — by 2015. 
The Foundation focuses on three critical 
areas: the marketplace, the workplace 
and schools. 
One of the programs coordinated by the 
Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation 
is Together Counts, created to inspire 
active and healthy living. The principle 
behind the program is energy balance, or balancing the calories people consume 
with the calories that they burn. Families 
can log onto the Together Counts web-
site and “Take the Pledge” to schedule 
at least two meals and two activities 
together every week. Campbell and Pepperidge Farm further promote the 
Together Counts program through our 
Facebook page and website.
In addition, Campbell President and 
CEO Denise Morrison is a member of 
ChildObesity180 (CO180). CO180 brings together a wide range of stakeholders 
from various sectors to provide a politically 
neutral point of engagement, create con-
nections among leaders and organizations, 
and utilize the latest research to deliver 
impactful ways to improve children’s health. 
Key components of the CO180 approach 
include multi-sector collaboration, capacity 
building, large-scale initiatives and process and outcome measures. 
Heart-Healthy Foods
According to the World Health 
Organization, more people die annually 
from cardiovascular disease than from 
any other cause. Poor diet and physical 
inactivity, leading to excess weight and 
obesity, are among the most common risk factors for heart disease. In addition, 
the Dietary Guidelines recommend that 
Americans reduce their intake of calo-
ries, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, 
sodium and sugar. Excess consumption 
of these nutrients has been linked to 
increased risk for cardiovascular and 
other chronic diseases.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  53Campbell’s commitment to heart-healthy foods can be seen 
in our efforts to reduce sodium throughout our portfolio. 
Our sodium-reduction efforts began in the late 1960s when 
we introduced Campbell’s low-sodium soups. Since then, we 
have made significant progress in advancing our science, 
technology and formulation capabilities to deliver reduced- 
sodium choices that also taste great. Today we have more 
than 460 products, or 66 percent of our U.S. retail portfolio, 
that are at or below 480 milligrams of sodium per serving, 
the level the FDA has set for healthy foods. This number of products has nearly tripled since 2009 and includes 
items across our soup, sauce, canned pasta, beverage 
and bakery portfolios. 
Variety is, in fact, an important part of our commitment to 
providing consumers with heart-healthy foods that meet their 
dietary needs. To be labeled heart-healthy, an individual 
food must meet stringent criteria set by the FDA, which 
requires no more than 3 grams of fat, 1 gram of saturated fat, 20 milligrams of cholesterol and 480 milligrams of 
sodium per serving. It also must contain at least 10 percent 
of the daily value for Vitamin A, Vitamin C, calcium, iron, 
protein or fiber. In 2013, more than 200 Campbell products 
met these criteria.
Moreover, in FY2013 Campbell had more than 100 products 
independently certified as “Heart-Healthy” by the American 
Heart Association (AHA), including soups, sauces, beverages and breads. The AHA Heart-Check mark identifies products 
that meet certain criteria for heart-healthy foods as part of 
an overall sensible eating pattern that is low in saturated 
fat and cholesterol. We’re also the first company to provide 
consumers with AHA-certified recipes, which can be found 
at our Nutrition Portal (www.campbellnutrition.com). 
Promoting Heart Health
Just as we support community-based, weight-management programs, Campbell is also committed to promoting heart 
health through our participation in several programs and 
projects. Each February for the past seven years, we have 
supported the AHA’s Address Your Heart campaign, part of 
the AHA’s Go Red for Women movement. Our participation 
is part of a $5.4 million pledge of support that we have 
made to the Go Red for Women campaign through 2015. In February 2013, Campbell joined forces with Chef Antonia Lofaso of Bravo TV’s Top Chef All-Stars to kick off the 
Address Your Heart Kitchen Project — a way to support 
creative ideas for heart-healthy eating and cooking. During 
that month, Campbell launched the Address Your Heart  
website, www.addressyourheart.com, which provided visitors with recipes and heart-healthy cooking tips from Chef Lofaso. 
It also provided an open forum for sharing heart-healthy ideas 
and downloadable coupons for Campbell heart-healthy 
products. Participants also had the opportunity to win a $50,000 kitchen makeover, plus a year’s supply of Campbell’s 
heart-healthy products. 
Campbell participates in the National Salt Reduction 
Initiative (NSRI), an effort coordinated by the New York City 
Department of Health to encourage Americans to reduce 
their salt intake by 20 percent by 2015. Our Pepperidge Farm  
breads and rolls, among several other Campbell products, already meet NSRI targets and we have committed our SpaghettiOs pasta products to the program as well.
Nutrition, Health and Well-Being Partnerships Down Under
In Australia, Arnott’s continues to support the Healthier 
Australia Commitment, which seeks to reduce certain nutri-
ents in foods. Under this initiative, the industry has pledged 
to reduce sodium in selected products by 25 percent by 2015; 
reduce saturated fats by 25 percent; and reduce calories in 
products by 12.5 percent.
In addition, Arnott’s is participating in the Food and Health 
Dialogue led by the Australian Department of Health and 
Ageing, and has committed to reduce sodium across 
selected products in its Arnott’s savory biscuit and 
Campbell's soup portfolios. For example:
• By December 2014, Campbell aims to reduce the sodium in its canned and microwaveable soup lines to a maximum 
300 milligrams of sodium per 100 grams. Campbell has also committed to a sales-weighted average of sodium 
for all our soup lines equal to 290 milligrams of sodium 
per 100 grams.
• By December 2015, Arnott’s has agreed to a maximum 15 percent sodium reduction for products above the 
following voluntary targets: 850 milligrams per 100 
grams for plain crackers, flavored rice crackers, cakes 
and corn cakes, and 1,000 milligrams per 100 grams 
for flavored crackers.

Food Safety & Quality: 
Overview
Opportunity: Ensure the safety and quality of our food products 
in the marketplace.
Food safety is of paramount importance. 
Campbell is dedicated to seriousness  
in providing consumers with safe and 
wholesome products of the highest 
quality. Protecting against outbreaks 
of foodborne illness is a responsibility shared throughout the food supply, from 
farm to fork. Since the day of our found-
ing, Campbell has invested in food safety 
systems designed to protect against 
foodborne hazards through every step 
of the value chain. 
Our food safety programs involve a variety 
of Campbell business units and functional 
teams, with internal experts and teams 
working with external partners to manage 
risks and protect our consumers, our 
brands and our Company. We use moni-
toring and prevention technologies that 
are unparalleled in the industry, and work 
continuously to ensure that our food safety and quality control systems are 
the most modern and meet the highest 
standards. Campbell prides itself on the 
quality control standards and policies 
we have in place, as well as our strong 
record of regulatory compliance. These 
are standards we apply not only to our 
own facilities, but also to the facilities of 
our contract manufacturers and suppliers around in the world.Campbell’s food safety professionals draw from a variety of scientific disciplines, 
including microbiology, thermal process-
ing, analytical chemistry and forensic 
analysis. We also review and contribute to 
the latest food safety research published by highly respected technical, trade and 
scientific organizations, and play a leader-
ship role in the Grocery Manufacturers 
Association (GMA) — allowing us to share 
best practices among peer companies. 
Campbell has also committed to the 
Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) and requires all our manufacturing facilities to 
be certified to GFSI-recognized standards.
Technological advancements have made 
a significant impact on our food safety 
processes. Campbell professionals regu-
larly employ tools such as optical sorters, 
X-rays, magnetic scanning or metal 
detectors that can help our quality teams identify and eliminate foreign objects. 
We’ve also used X-ray technology to help 
identify package or filling defects before 
those products leave the plant. In addi-
tion, we’ve helped develop a “vision” 
system that ensures that canned items 
are properly labeled by the time they 
reach store shelves.

Food Safety & Quality: 
Ingredients
Ingredient Safety
Campbell’s commitment to food safety 
goes beyond our own facilities to extend 
to our suppliers and the ingredients they 
provide for our products. We have a 
comprehensive program to ensure the 
safety of ingredients and packaging materials throughout our supply chain. 
This effort involves direct collaboration 
with our suppliers, packaging companies 
and co-manufacturers to make sure 
their quality controls meet our exacting 
standards. Just as Campbell regularly 
evaluates and improves its own processes, we’re doing the same with our suppliers 
and other partners to ensure that we are 
all on a path of continuous improvement.
We use our Supply Base Requirements 
and Expectations Manual, most recently 
updated in August 2013, to ensure that the 
ingredients we purchase from worldwide 
suppliers meet our strict safety and quality requirements. The Manual outlines the 
rigorous standards that Campbell has 
developed over many years, which are 
based on evolving best practices within 
the food production industry. To make 
sure our standards are met, from time to 
time Campbell will require suppliers to 
submit to comprehensive audits of their 
systems and locations, which include on-site inspections. This requirement 
applies to suppliers in the United States 
and around the world.Under the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, foreign suppliers will soon 
be required to verify that their food 
safety systems and programs meet U.S. 
standards before their products will 
be permitted to enter U.S. commerce. Campbell, in anticipation of this new 
requirement, recently developed a 
worldwide mapping of our supply base 
that allows us to review and monitor 
where we source our product ingredients 
and track supplier performance and 
compliance. Suppliers must also be able to demonstrate that they have the con-
trol and monitoring programs required 
to ensure that these safety and quality 
standards are being maintained. 
An example of Campbell’s proactive 
approach toward food safety is the use of 
preventive control systems such as Hazard 
Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) and prerequisite programs, 
both at our own facilities and at supplier 
facilities. Through analytical testing, 
microbiological assays, investigations of 
packaging integrity and other method-
ologies, the HACCP process enables our 
facilities and our suppliers’ facilities to 
prevent food hazards that are reasonably 
likely to occur in their processing systems. The HACCP systems also help our Global 
Procurement and Supply Base Quality 
teams conduct the type of holistic site 
audits that make Campbell a leader in 
food safety.

Food allergies have received growing attention from  
consumers, particularly those who are concerned about cross-contamination that may occur during the processing 
of food. At Campbell we regulate food allergens via strict 
internal controls that safeguard against any cross-contact 
with unintended ingredients. These include a data system 
designed to maintain the accuracy of label ingredient 
statements and allergen disclosures, as well as our own 
advanced coding and scanning technology to help verify individual packages for labeling accuracy, allergen control 
and product traceability.
Some of the food allergens that Campbell monitors 
include:
• Fin fish
• Peanuts
• Wheat
• Shellfish
• Tree nuts
• Soy protein
• Eggs 
• Sesame seeds
• Dairy protein (Australia only)
• Gluten
Genetically Modified (GM) IngredientsCampbell is keenly aware of ongoing concerns among  
consumers and regulators over genetically modified ingre-dients of food products in some of the geographical markets 
where we sell products. For each of these markets, we employ rigorous practices to comply with local laws and regulations 
to guard against commingling of ingredients and maintain 
the integrity of our ingredient stream.

Food Safety & Quality: 
Quality
Managing Quality
Although we maintain strict and consistent 
quality controls over our manufacturing 
processes, Campbell acts swiftly and 
effectively whenever we suspect that the 
safety of any product may be threatened 
or compromised. Food safety incidents generally fall into one of three categories:
• Class 1: Incidents presenting a  reasonable probability that use of 
the food will cause serious adverse 
health consequences or death, e.g. , 
a product contaminated with food-borne pathogens.
• Class 2: Incidents where the probability 
of adverse health consequences from 
use of the product is remote, e.g. , 
where the label fails to declare small amounts of undeclared allergens 
associated with mild human reactions, 
or small amounts of foreign material 
are discovered in the product or 
packaging.
• Class 3: Incidents where use of the 
product will not cause adverse health 
consequences, e.g. , violations of 
labeling regulations that do not have an impact on consumer health.For any class of food safety incident, the Campbell Corporate Crisis Management 
Team, working with the appropriate  
regulatory agency and teams within the applicable business unit, initiates a recall 
process to alert consumers to the concern and takes steps to remove the product 
immediately from store warehouses  
and shelves. Working through protocols established by government agencies 
around the world, Campbell teams  
provide regular updates to the agencies on the scope and status of any product recall. We also provide 24-hour support 
to consumers and our retail trade cus-
tomers to address any questions and 
concerns. Then, following any recall, 
Campbell initiates a thorough root-cause 
analysis to identify and implement 
corrective actions. 
In 2013, Campbell had a total of five 
product recalls — one each affecting 
Bolthouse Farms and Plum Organics  
products, and two others affecting product offerings in Europe. In addition, 
Campbell recalled a mislabeled product 
in the United States.

Sustainable Agriculture: 
Overview
Opportunity: Encourage responsible and sustainable agriculture 
to protect the long-term viability of ecosystems.
Responsible management of agricultural 
resources has been a hallmark of 
Campbell’s operations since our beginning. 
So when our Sustainable Agriculture 
Program re-launched with a strategic 
emphasis in 2012, we were building upon more than 140 years of investment in agri-
cultural research and farmer partnerships. 
Today, our Sustainable Agriculture 
Program is guided by a formal strategic 
plan centered on tomatoes and other 
vegetables — strategic and iconic crops for Campbell’s portfolio. The Program is 
also linked with Campbell Procurement 
and other industry-wide efforts regarding 
strategic ingredients such as poultry, beef, 
dairy and flour. In 2013, Campbell began 
working directly with these suppliers 
to communicate our strategic plan for 
synchronizing their sustainability efforts 
with our own.
Our sustainable agriculture strategy focuses 
on driving improvement in five priority 
areas — greenhouse gas (GHG), water, 
fertilizer and pesticide reduction, and 
soil quality improvements — all of which 
were identified through a stakeholder 
engagement exercise in 2012. For three of 
these priorities, we have set 2020 goals:•  Climate: Reduce GHGs per pound of 
ingredient by 20 percent.
•  Water: Reduce water use per unit of ingredient by 20 percent.
•  Fertilizer: Reduce nitrogen applied per pound of ingredient by 10 percent.A year into the program, we have made 
progress in each of these priority areas, 
particularly water consumption. Based 
on data collected in 2012, we know the 
typical Campbell farmer needs approxi-
mately 9 gallons of water for every pound of tomatoes produced, which amounts to 
73 percent of the best estimated average 
for all processing tomato farmers in 
California. But there’s still room for 
improvement. To reach our 2020 goal, 
we’re working directly with contract 
farms to develop more sustainable irrigation practices. 
Drip irrigation, for example, is one of 
the most efficient methods of watering 
crops because drip-irrigated tomato 
fields typically use about 61 percent of 
the amount of water (per pound) required 
by the traditional irrigation method. The 
number of Campbell growers using drip irrigation has almost doubled in the last 
five years, with 39 percent of Campbell’s 
tomato acres currently using this type of 
irrigation. Using our 2012 baseline data, 
we are seeking to increase that number 
by identifying drip-irrigation opportunities 
across geographies. By showing individual 
growers how their water use compares 
to local/state averages, we ultimately want to help them move toward more 
efficient irrigation practices. 
OPPORTUNITIES  |  59
(continued)SECTION  |  60
2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
OPPORTUNITIES  |  60Our focus on water extends to our  
processing plants as well. For example, 
our tomato processing plant in Dixon, 
California, reduced water discharges by 
10 percent in FY2013. During the year, the 
plant completed a study that tracked 
the intersection of water and energy 
throughout the facility. The study found 
that 37 percent of the electricity used 
during the tomato processing season was to move water from one place to the next. 
As a result, we identified opportunities to 
save more than $300,000 in costs by real-
izing better water and energy efficiency.
GHG Reduction
Nitrogen fertilizer is the largest contributor 
to GHG emissions made by farming 
practices. Best practices and improve-ments in the efficiency of nitrogen use 
are keys to achieving our GHG goal. 
Our baseline 2012 data revealed that 
Campbell farmers used 115 percent of 
the recommended fertilizer rates; those 
using drip irrigation were slightly better, 
at 105 percent of the recommended 
rates. Though these rates are roughly in line with the California state averages, 
we believe sound planning can reduce 
these percentages even further. 
In tomato production, drip irrigation 
technology is again part of the solution. 
At the University of California Davis Russell 
Ranch facility, scientists documented a 
more than 50 percent reduction (per acre) of the key GHG associated with fertilizer 
— nitrogen oxide — when drip irrigation 
is used to deliver the fertilizer close to 
the plant roots. We urge our growers to adopt drip irrigation where economically 
feasible, along with nutrient management 
planning best practices such as soil test-
ing and nitrogen budgeting. (In 2007, 
the University of California Davis Russell 
Ranch facility received an endowment 
of $200,000 from Campbell to support 
sustainable agriculture research.)
Pesticide Use
Reducing pests and disease helps create 
healthier crops and increases yields, but 
the industry’s traditional control methods 
have often focused on pesticides. 
Sustainable pest and disease management 
is achievable through a focus on prevention 
and by employing a variety of coordinated 
methods — otherwise known as integrated 
pest management (IPM). Each year, Campbell agriculture experts work to add 
more disease-resistant tomato varieties 
to our agriculture program, with the goal 
of creating plant varieties that allow 
farmers to increase yields while reducing 
or eliminating the need for pesticides. 
Though an effective pest management 
program will generally utilize pesticides to some degree, Campbell works with 
growers to ensure that prevention prac-
tices are the first line of defense. Pesticide 
reduction is an area where Campbell has 
historically been a leader. In the 1990s, 
for example, we helped pioneer the 
use of IPM in the California tomato 
processing industry. 
Sustainable Agriculture: Overview Continued
Putting Sustainability in Action
As part of a 10-year agreement 
with the Ohio EPA, since 2008 Campbell has been investing $50,000 per year in stormwater management projects on farms upstream from our Napoleon, Ohio, plant, which is located along the Maumee River approximately  45 miles from Lake Erie. Through 2013, Campbell has played a part in establishing 31 new wetland acres, planting more than 3,000 acres of cover crops and helping 18 land-owners install controlled drainage systems on more than 1,400 acres of farmland. Managing stormwater runoff from the farmers’ fields and keeping fertilizer chemicals out of the river produces a cleaner habitat for the fish and waterfowl populations of the Maumee River and Lake Erie.

Sustainable Agriculture: 
Biodiversity
OPPORTUNITIES  |  61Fostering Biodiversity at Plant Sites
Supporting biodiversity is fundamental 
to sustainable agriculture. Beyond the 
fields of our growers, we look for oppor-
tunities to support biodiversity initiatives 
at our own manufacturing locations. Our 
tomato processing plant in Dixon, California, 
is a good example. Here, we are partner-
ing with Henry’s Bullfrog Bees to develop beekeeping areas on the property, one of 
several development efforts benefitting 
wildlife in the area. 
Henry’s Bullfrog Bees produces and  
bottles raw, all-natural honey from the 
bee colonies on the Dixon property. The 
honey, however, is just a byproduct of 
the benefit the bees provide to Dixon and the surrounding community. Bees 
are necessary to properly pollinate the 
area’s flowering and agricultural plants, 
helping ensure higher yields and quality 
fruits. Encouraging pollination through 
bee management is a simple, sustainable 
method of increasing productivity and 
plant health. 
Our partnership with Henry’s Bullfrog 
Bees is just one effort in Dixon that is 
designed to increase wildlife habitats. 
Campbell has also been instrumental in developing pond habitats on the site 
and has installed many owl boxes to 
provide natural pest management and 
biodiversity.

Healthy Communities: 
Overview
Opportunity: Build and support programs that  
create healthier communities.
Since our inception in 1869 as a small 
canning company, Campbell has always 
found ways to share with those around us 
and hold close the communities we call 
home. Through the years, our business 
has grown far beyond our hometown of Camden, New Jersey, as we entered new 
markets and acquired new businesses. 
In each instance, we have carried with 
us the same sense of community and 
responsibility that has been an inherent 
part of who we are as an organization 
since the beginning. Today, our com-munity activities span several dozen 
communities and several continents. 
Wherever we operate, we strive to make 
innovation a hallmark of our programs. 
Writing checks and providing willing 
volunteers are not enough to answer press-
ing societal needs. We are committed 
to developing thoughtful solutions,  
like our social impact program, Healthy 
Communities, which is focused on collab-
orative action to improve the health of 
young people; and to produce-to-donate 
initiatives such as our Just Peachy salsa 
manufacturing operation in Camden and 
the Full Effect Super Smoothie from 
Plum Organics.These efforts are just a few of many 
focused on a pair of destination goals 
that guide our community work. By 
2020, Campbell wants to measurably 
improve the health of young people in 
our hometown communities by reducing childhood obesity and hunger by 50 
percent, and to make a positive impact 
on the lives of 100 million youth through 
our volunteer, community and signature 
programs. These are ambitious goals for 
sure, but they are backed by 145 years 
of commitment to nourishing the com -
munities where we live and work.
In recent years, we have increasingly sought 
to apply our capabilities and expertise as 
one of the world’s largest food companies 
to increase the impact of our community 
involvement. This strategic approach is 
centered on building healthy communities 
and was launched in Camden in 2011 and shortly thereafter in Norwalk, Connecticut, 
the home of Pepperidge Farm. We have 
focused our efforts on childhood obesity 
and hunger, major health problems for 
Camden and Norwalk, as well as the 
entire country.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  64Recognizing that we don’t have all the answers, we’ve 
spent the past three years developing our community 
strategy through Campbell Healthy Communities in 
Camden and Norwalk as we find the right partners and 
approach. By focusing on one community, we’re building a 
program foundation that can be leveraged and adapted to 
help meet the needs of other Campbell communities — 
with the potential of impacting thousands of youth across 
the country. 
The approach is straightforward, but innovative — combining 
our expertise as a food company with a range of Campbell 
community initiatives to drive the most impact. Residents of healthy communities must have food security, financial stability and sound education, and live in a sustainable 
environment. At Campbell, we combine our cause-related 
marketing efforts and funding from the Campbell Soup 
Foundation and Arnott’s Foundation with volunteer support 
and financial and programmatic contributions from our 
corporate signature program, Campbell Healthy Communities, 
to drive this work. Throwing money at a problem is not 
the solution, but the combined power of our resources, 
employees’ skills and passion, plus corporate commitment and a host of engaged community leaders and organizations, 
is a winning combination for success.

Our Employees
Each year, enthusiastic and dedicated Campbell employees 
across the globe provide more than 21,000 hours of volunteer 
service to those in need in their local communities. While our 
employees do give fresh coats of paint to local buildings, they 
spend a majority of their volunteer time lending their skills 
and expertise to organizations that need it most. In FY2013, 
Campbell’s Human Resources team provided resume writing and interview workshops to local impoverished women to put 
them on the path to finding stable employment. Campbell chefs 
and nutritionists taught youth how to cook nutritious and 
budget-friendly meals. Campbell marketers assisted with the 
development of communication and marketing plans for nonprofit partners. Skills-based employee volunteer activity 
accounted for 20 percent of Campbell’s total volunteer 
hours in FY2013. 
Team volunteer events are a staple of community engagement 
at Campbell. While these events happen year-round at various 
Campbell locations, more than 3,600 employees across North 
America make a special effort to participate in Make a Difference 
Week — our annual week of volunteer service. In FY2013, these volunteers came from 16 different Campbell and Pepperidge 
Farm locations in the United States and Canada and collectively 
participated in 90 different projects centered on building 
healthier communities. In Camden, employees gleaned more 
than 5,000 pounds of produce from southern New Jersey 
farms, created 1,800 meals at MANNA, packed 2,000 sand-
wiches for the homeless with the Cathedral Kitchen and 
reconditioned a baseball field for more than 200 youth, just 
to highlight a few results. 
Pepperidge Farm and Campbell plant locations donated and 
packed nearly 4,000 backpacks of food for local youth who 
participate in the National School Lunch Program during the 
school week but face potential hunger during the weekend. 
These FY2013 results were double the contributions from 
FY2012, which benefited local Feeding America food banks and 
their member agencies. Participation in our Make a Difference 
Week has doubled in size each year since its 2007 inception, and we’re proud of the difference our people make — not 
only to Campbell, but also to the areas where we’re located.In Norwalk, Connecticut, home of our Pepperidge Farm headquarters, more than 200 employees participated in 
their annual all-employee service day. In FY2013, the team 
focused on the restoration of Calf Pasture Beach, which 
was badly damaged during Superstorm Sandy. We part-
nered with Keep America Beautiful to restore the beaches 
and play areas so Norwalk’s children could have a safe 
place to play and exercise in time for the summer months.
Our Dollars for Doers program is another way we help our 
employee volunteers make an even greater impact on their 
community. This program supports the volunteer efforts of 
Campbell employees by providing grant funding to community nonprofits based on service hours, regardless of whether 
employees volunteer those hours during the workday or on 
their own time. Hours are tracked in our Nourishing Our 
Neighbors portal, an online tool that captures volunteer 
hours, service projects, community events and more.
In the Dollars for Doers program, for every 25 hours volunteered 
by a Campbell employee to an eligible nonprofit organization, 
that organization receives a $500 grant from the Campbell Soup Foundation. The program is a huge success: In just the 
past two years, grants have increased by almost 20 percent 
and totaled $290,000 in FY2013, with 44 percent of those 
going to organizations in our target community of Camden. 
By supporting the volunteer work and passion of our 
employees with grant dollars, we are driving even greater 
impacts in the communities in which we operate.
Finally, in most areas where Campbell has a facility, we’ve 
established a steady volunteer partnership with the local 
Feeding America food bank. In each location, our employees 
assist with projects ranging from sorting food and packing 
kids’ backpacks and senior boxes, to building storage capability 
and assisting with capacity building through board service. 
In plant locations, employees assist with member agency 
programs, such as summer feeding with Northwest Community 
Action in Napoleon, Ohio, and school-based pantries with 
In As Much in Maxton, North Carolina. In FY2013, more than 
30 percent of Campbell’s total volunteer hours were dedicated 
to Feeding America food banks and their member agencies.

Communities, we also provide financial 
support to organizations serving our local 
communities through a range of additional 
outlets. These include Matching Gifts to 
Education, United Way employee giving campaigns and Dollars for Doers, direct 
giving through the Arnott’s Foundation, 
disaster relief campaigns and in-kind 
support through product donations. 
Campbell Soup Foundation Programs
The Campbell Soup Foundation supports 
three employee giving programs — 
Matching Gifts to Education, United Way 
employee giving campaigns and Dollars 
for Doers. Matching Gifts to Education allows employees to contribute to their 
alma mater with a one-for-one match of 
their contributions to institutions of higher education and preparatory high schools. 
In FY2013, schools that received dona-
tions from more than 100 employees 
benefited from more than $102,000 in 
matching grants. 
Campbell consistently strives to pair 
employee passion and skills with financial 
support to drive the most impact with nonprofit partners in our local communi-
ties. Dollars for Doers supports employee 
volunteerism with direct grants based on 
their service time with eligible nonprofit 
organizations. 
Campbell also supports employee giving 
through our annual United Way giving 
campaigns. Campbell employees, in fact, are the largest contributors to the United Way in many of the communities where 
we operate. Support of the United Way 
and its work is high, with participation 
rates topping 96 percent in our Camden 
headquarters in the FY2013 United Way 
campaign. Overall, 16 Campbell and 
Pepperidge Farm locations hosted giving campaigns last year, with employees’ 
contributions totaling $1.16 million. Coupled 
with a match from the Campbell Soup 
Foundation, United Way organizations 
across the country received almost $1.79 million for the purpose of bringing vital 
social services to the residents of our 
local communities.
Arnott’s Foundation
The employee-funded Arnott’s Foundation 
was founded in 2004 with a distinct focus 
on creating positive environments and 
healthy communities that allow Australian families to build, maintain and enjoy a 
better quality of life. The main beneficiary 
of the Arnott’s Foundation is Camp Quality, 
which provides support to the families 
of children diagnosed with cancer. In 
FY2013, the Arnott’s Foundation provided 
AU$273,570 to Camp Quality, which 
funded the Family Camp Program benefit-
ing hundreds of Australian families.  
This total represented a 13 percent, or 
AU$36,000, increase in employee 
donations. In addition to support of 
Camp Quality, the Arnott’s Foundation 
also made an AU$25,000 donation to 
Fairy Sparkle to help build and maintain 
fairy gardens at local hospitals to assist 
with youth recovery.

Hunger isn’t an issue that Campbell can solve on its own — 
that’s why we work closely with national organizations 
such as Feeding America and others. In addition to our 
employee volunteers donating their time, Campbell also 
does its part by making product donations to support the 
fight against hunger, an important element in building 
healthy communities.
In FY2013, Campbell donated more than $44 million worth 
of product in support of the efforts of thousands of 
charitable organizations throughout the U.S. This support 
was primarily to various Feeding America food banks and their member agencies, in addition to products distributed 
through ongoing reclamation efforts.
In Australia, Arnott’s contributed AU$1.1 million worth of 
product to Foodbank Australia and its member agencies in 
2013, including biscuits, soup, stock and juice. In addition, 
Arnott’s provided juice and biscuits to Driver Reviver total-
ing AU$69,000 to help provide a respite for tired drivers 
on Australian roads to prevent car accidents. 
Campbell Canada continued its multiyear commitment with 
Food Banks Canada, providing more than 1 million pounds 
of food to support food-insecure Canadian families.Disaster Relief
In FY2013, Superstorm Sandy ravaged the East Coast of the 
United States, severely impacting locations near where 
Campbell has its headquarters and Ecce Pannis, a Pepperidge 
Farm manufacturing facility. Campbell responded to the 
natural disaster with a $50,000 contribution to the American 
Red Cross in support of emergency aid and an additional 
$100,000 to the New Jersey Governor’s Relief Fund to 
support long-term recovery efforts. Product donations 
totaling more than $80,000 were made to American Red Cross shelters and Feeding America food banks in the affected 
regions. Campbell employees in Camden also designated 
more than $100,000 in United Way contributions to a long-term recovery fund set up in partnership with the 
American Red Cross. 
In the city of Ya’an in the southwest Sichuan province of 
China, a magnitude-7.0 earthquake rocked the region, kill-
ing 200 people, injuring thousands and leaving more than 
2 million residents in five villages in urgent need of rescue 
and relief. The Campbell Swire team quickly mobilized to 
send condensed pouch soups to the victims. The team worked with the China Population Welfare Foundation to 
overcome the many delivery obstacles and ensure more 
than 6,600 cases of soup made their way to the residents 
who needed them most.
Campbell also responded to the devastating tornado that 
hit Moore, Oklahoma, demolishing homes and killing more 
than 20 people. In response to a request from the American 
Red Cross, we donated three pallets of Campbell's Chunky Creamy Chicken and Dumplings soup from our Paris, Texas, 
manufacturing site, about 200 miles from the affected areas. 
Campbell also made a $50,000 corporate contribution 
to the American Red Cross in support of the spring and 
summer storm season.
In response to these and other disasters impacting regions 
where we have operations, Campbell has created a First 
Responder Disaster Team to adequately evaluate quick and 
effective response to disasters with financial contributions, 
volunteer support, product donations and more.

We focus many of our community efforts 
in and around our Camden headquarters, 
where the Campbell name has been a 
fixture since the Company’s founding. 
This focus is not only because we have 
a historic connection to the city, but also 
because we are using many of our Camden 
programs as models for the type of involvement we’d like to leverage in other 
communities as we move toward our 
2020 destination goals to measurably 
improve the health of young people and 
impact the lives of 100 million youth.
In 2011, we formally launched our Campbell 
Healthy Communities program, commit-
ting $10 million over 10 years in support 
of our goals and appointing a Director of 
Healthy Communities to drive our efforts 
in Camden and other North American 
Campbell communities. Initial efforts are 
focused on six sites: four schools, two community-based organizations and on 
community-wide programs such as the 
Healthy Corner Store Initiative and Soccer 
for Success. Our strategy is centered on 
four areas:
• Food Access: Ensuring access  
to high-quality, affordable and 
nutritious foods.• Physical Activity/Access: Providing 
safe places to play, exercise and walk.
• Nutrition Education: Supporting a healthy lifestyle by teaching children, 
parents and school staff about healthy 
food choices and how to prepare 
balanced meals.
• Public Will: Engaging the public as 
a partner in the creation and sus-
tainability of a healthy community.
As a food company with a strong portfolio 
of healthy and nutritious products, Campbell is uniquely positioned to help 
create an accessible and equitable food 
system in the Camden community. We’re 
doing this by constantly leveraging our 
expertise, integrating nutrition education 
throughout our program strategies and 
engaging the community in all aspects of 
our work. By partnering with local groups 
ranging from food banks to youth orga-nizations to various business enterprises, 
we’ve been able to make notable progress 
in each of our focus areas. 
The differentiation for Campbell is in  
our approach. We have implemented a 
collective impact methodology relying 
on multiple community partners with 
whom we have created a robust public/private partnership to drive and own 
the work in the community, so it can be 
sustainable and impactful. Programs such 
as cooking classes for youth, in-classroom 
nutrition education and parental engage-
ment, and expanding product choices and 
availability at corner stores to create a 
stronger local food economy are all driving 
this work. We are engaging additional

than $1 million in leveraged funds invested in the Camden 
community focused on building healthy communities.
With the growing success of the Campbell Healthy 
Communities program, now in its third year, we’re in a 
position to start leveraging our Camden experiences in 
other Campbell communities. Although the locations, issues 
and resources may be different elsewhere, our overall goals 
of increasing access to food and physical activity, providing 
nutrition education and generating good public will are 
objectives that can readily be achieved in other communities across North America.Campbell Soup Foundation
The Campbell Soup Foundation, the philanthropic arm of 
Campbell Soup Company, provides financial support to 
institutions working on the ground to positively impact 
local community residents, especially children, in the U.S. communities where we operate. With a Board of Trustees 
made up of Campbell employees, the Foundation receives 
almost 200 grant requests annually through grant cycles 
held each September and January.
In FY2013 we incorporated a number of changes into how the 
Campbell Soup Foundation operates in order to streamline 
our giving process while staying focused on our core strategic 
Campbell Healthy Communities Program
Food Access
Created 94 new food outlets in Camden, including 
22 new locations in our corner store network, 64 
new Community Supported Agriculture shares 
and eight new “mobile produce markets.”Physical Activity/Access
Provided 175,000 hours of physical activity for 
youth through the Y CATCH and Boys & Girls 
Club Soccer for Success programs — a 75 percent 
increase over FY2012.
Nutrition Education
Completed more than 193,000 hours of nutrition 
education in the Camden community — roughly 
100 hours of education per child and three hours 
of education per adult.Public Will
Facilitated a series of local stakeholder forums on 
hunger and community issues, impacting the lives 
of more than 2,000 participants.SECTION  |  71

economic sustainability. These focus areas support the 
building and sustaining of a healthy community and com-plement the work of the Campbell Healthy Communities 
program. The Foundation narrowed its selection process  
in order to make fewer direct grants, but in larger, more 
impactful amounts. As a result, 28 direct grants were made 
in FY2013, as opposed to 40 in FY2011. We also developed 
an Executive Committee made up of Campbell employees 
to help engage and inform the grant proposal review 
process. In addition, we launched GIFTS Online, a grant 
management system that supports a fully automated proposal and reporting process.
In FY2013, the Campbell Soup Foundation provided more 
than $1.71 million in grants to partner organizations, with 
more than $900,000 dedicated to agencies serving the 
Camden community. 
Neighborhood Revitalization Tax Credit Program
Beyond investing in social service agencies, Campbell works with community development corporations in Camden on 
citywide revitalization efforts. Through the Neighborhood 
Revitalization Tax Credit Program (NRTC), Campbell has funded 
neighborhood improvement plans in the city since 2008. 
The investments in FY2013 bring the total invested through 
the NRTC program to $4.9 million in support of Camden 
neighborhood plans and citywide revitalization efforts.Funded partners and initiatives include the renovation of 
city parks to allow residents and youth more access to safe, 
environmentally friendly green spaces, eye-in-the-sky cameras to increase safety in city neighborhoods, renovation of 
abandoned buildings to create artist studios, writing centers 
and affordable housing and much more. These neighborhood 
plans each distinctly address specific issues identified by 
residents, such as air quality, safety, housing, education and 
environmental concerns. By supporting agencies working 
to address these needs, we are assisting in yet another way 
in driving the economic sustainability of the City of Camden 
and building a healthy community for its residents.
Campbell Healthy Community Kitchen
In 2012, Campbell announced a $500,000 donation to the 
Salvation Army Ray and Joan Kroc Corps Community Center 
in Camden. The Community Center is a 120,000-square-foot 
facility that will feature family and fitness services, an eight- 
lane competition pool and water park, chapel, theater and 
dance studio. The Camden facility will be one of 27 centers 
that the Kroc Estate has helped build in underserved com-munities around the United States. Our donation will also 
enable the Community Center to become the home of the 
Campbell Community Kitchen, a place where Campbell 
volunteers and chefs will provide nutrition education and 
healthy cooking demonstrations, as well as feeding up to 
350,000 visitors annually. In addition, young people in 
after-school programs from local youth organizations will 
eat meals served from the kitchen. The Community Center 
is scheduled to open in 2014.SECTION  |  72

Norwalk
Pepperidge Farm’s Hometown: Norwalk, Connecticut
Like our flagship Campbell’s brand, the 
Pepperidge Farm brand has a close  
connection to its Norwalk, Connecticut, hometown, since Margaret Rudkin started 
the famous brand by baking and selling 
bread in 1937. Today, Pepperidge Farm counts 1,050 employees in Norwalk, which 
remains the headquarters for its portfolio 
of baked and frozen products. Pepperidge 
Farm has long engaged its local resi-
dents, most recently in efforts to build a 
healthy Norwalk community and combat 
incidences of childhood obesity. 
Project L.E.A.N.
In Norwalk, childhood obesity rates stand 
at approximately 40 percent, well above 
the national average rate of 30 percent. 
This statistic prompted Pepperidge Farm 
to invite a diverse group of community 
stakeholders — including the Norwalk 
Hospital, the Norwalk Health Department and Jefferson Elementary School — to 
join in developing a new approach to 
solve this challenge and build a healthier 
Norwalk community. Through effective 
engagement and collaboration, each of 
these stakeholders helped design and 
implement the Learning with Energy 
from Activity and Nutrition (L.E.A.N.) 
Project in 2010.
Project L.E.A.N. is a pilot program designed 
to teach a targeted group of elementary 
students at Jefferson Elementary School 
the importance of good nutrition and 
regular physical activity. The program is 
designed for second graders who will be tracked for a period of three consecutive years. Some of the current elements of 
Project L.E.A.N. include classroom edu-
cation and exercise to promote good 
nutrition, healthy eating behaviors 
and physical activity, a before-school “Breakfast Boot Camp” providing students 
with 45 minutes of guided physical activity 
followed by a healthy breakfast, and 
regular parent sessions to drive engage-
ment and investment in Project L.E.A.N. 
To measure the success of the program, 
data is collected at the beginning and 
end of the school year, including body 
mass index (BMI) measures. Participating 
students are asked to complete pre- and 
post-questionnaires designed to measure 
their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors 
toward healthy eating and being physi-
cally active. As we complete our third 
year of the program, the results are very encouraging. There has been consistent 
improvement in the test students’ 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviors 
toward eating healthy foods and being 
active. Parental feedback continues to 
be extremely strong, absentee rates for 
the class are down and BMI results reveal 
an increase in the percentage of students 
with a “healthy” BMI. Jefferson Elementary School is so pleased with the results of 
the program that it has permanently 
integrated it into their school curriculum. 
Project L.E.A.N. will be expanding to 
Kendall Elementary School in Norwalk 
in FY2014.

For the third year running, employees at Pepperidge Farm 
headquarters in Norwalk continued the Kids BackPack 
Program in collaboration with United Way and the Connecticut 
Food Bank. In FY2013, 330 children who qualified for free 
and reduced-cost meals during the school week received 
backpacks full of food to sustain them through the weekend, 
a 165 percent increase over FY2012. Employee volunteers 
spent more than 300 hours packing and distributing more 
than 11,000 backpacks to students in need, increasing distribution by 60 percent. 
Keeping Norwalk Active
Pepperidge Farm understands the importance of play in 
keeping kids physically active. In FY2013, Pepperidge 
employees gathered together to assist with two playground 
builds in their Norwalk community. The first was a refurbish-
ment to Bouton Street Park, which followed a community 
build model. Pepperidge Farm, along with the Norwalk Corporate Citizenship Alliance, the Greater Norwalk Chamber 
of Commerce and the Norwalk Department of Recreation 
and Parks, worked to engage community residents in every 
aspect of refurbishment — from design, to safety to equip-
ment and more. The second playground construction was in 
Oyster Shell Park and was one of 26 playgrounds constructed 
in memory of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School 
shooting in December 2012. Working with the Where Angels Play Foundation and the Norwalk Professional Firefighters 
Association, Pepperidge Farm employees helped construct the 
playground in memory of Sandy Hook victim Allison Wyatt.
In addition, Pepperidge Farm worked with the Norwalk 
Health Department and the Norwalk Children’s Foundation 
to host a professional development day for local physical 
education teachers at Norwalk’s elementary schools. The 
objective of the training was to support the teachers’ journey as they seek to further develop their teaching skills in order 
to improve the health of Norwalk’s children.

At Campbell, our healthy community 
activities aren’t limited to the areas 
around our largest facilities. We’re a 
food company with a global footprint, 
that strives to make a positive impact in 
each and every location where we do 
business. While community needs and 
outreach may vary from place to place, our efforts remain true to Campbell’s core 
community goals: Measurably improve 
the health of young people in our home-
town communities, and make a positive 
impact on the lives of 100 million youth through our volunteer, community and 
signature programs. 
Healthy Communities in Java, Indonesia
In Indonesia, our Arnott’s employees in the 
Medan Satria community of Bekasi, Java, 
devoted FY2013 to community engage-
ment in an effort to better understand its 
neighbors and start developing Campbell outreach programs. The team worked to 
identify key stakeholders and listen to 
their most pressing needs in an effort to 
build a healthier community. After several 
sessions, Arnott’s employees identified 
four key issues for local residents — 
employment opportunities, health facilities, 
clean water and sound schools. In assess-
ing these community needs, a three-stage plan was developed that centered on 
skill-building for employment, health and 
nutrition, and education. 
The program kicked off in late 2012 by 
engaging 60 community stakeholders 
and organizing a community tour of the local Arnott’s facility, which attracted 240 local residents. January 2013 saw 
the first of several outreach programs:  
A Jalan Sehat, or healthy walk, which 
attracted 800 Medan Satria community 
participants. More programs are planned 
throughout FY2014.
Engaging Customers in the Fight 
Against Hunger in Canada
For Campbell Canada, building a healthy 
community means combating the growing 
level of food insecurity. Each month, more than 850,000 Canadians are assisted by 
food banks. In 2012, 14 percent of those 
food banks ran out of food to help those 
in need. In response, Campbell Canada 
partnered with Free the Children for a 
new, national campaign called We Scare 
Hunger, which encourages youth to col-
lect non-perishable food items leading 
up to and on Halloween. We also engaged retail partner Longos and its locations in 
Toronto, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Calgary 
for in-store activation. In addition to 
point-of-sale communications and a 
robust public relations campaign and 
social media outreach, the team built 
12-foot hunger walls made from more 
than 3,600 cans of Campbell’s soup. 
Customers were encouraged to “scare” hunger away by purchasing cans for 
donation. The effort resulted in the engage-
ment of more than 250,000 participants, 
including 1,586 local schools. More than 
875,000 pounds of food were donated 
to local food banks, the equivalent of 
feeding 172 families of four for one year.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  75Now in its fifth year, Campbell Canada’s Help Hunger 
Disappear program encourages Canadians to get involved 
and make donations to their local food banks. This annual 
spring hunger campaign is timed with National Hunger 
Awareness Day, and is designed to drive contributions when 
they are needed most. In partnership with four key retail 
partners, the program has evolved to include an in-store 
display of the word HUNGER built out of Campbell’s soup 
cans from which shoppers are encouraged to remove a can 
until HUNGER disappears. In FY2013, more than 41 events garnered thousands of pounds of food donations for Food 
Banks Canada.
In the U.S. — Stamp Out Hunger
For more than two decades, Campbell has partnered with the 
National Association of Letter Carriers and Feeding America 
on Stamp Out Hunger, the nation’s largest single-day food 
drive. Held the second Saturday in May, residents from across 
the country are invited to leave bags of non-perishable food items outside their mailboxes, which are then collected by 
the nation’s 210,000 letter carriers and delivered to local 
food banks. 
Campbell works to promote household awareness through 
the distribution of direct mail postcards, donation bags and 
a comprehensive social media and public relations campaign. 
But we do more than just advertise Stamp Out Hunger; each 
year, Campbell kicks off the drive by donating 1 million pounds of food to the effort.
In FY2013, the food drive generated 73 million pounds of 
food, bringing the total collected since the drive’s inception 
to well over 1 billion pounds. This also marked the 10th 
consecutive year that donation totals have topped 70 million 
pounds. 
In the U.S. — Let’s Can Hunger
Campbell is a strategic partner with Enactus, a nonprofit 
organization bringing together a global community of  
student, academic and business leaders committed to 
using the power of entrepreneurial action to transform 
lives and enable real human progress. In FY2013, collegiate members of Enactus teamed up with Campbell for a fifth straight year on an initiative called Let’s Can Hunger, a series of competitions in which participating 
teams developed creative solutions for urgent and lasting 
hunger relief. The challenge for the 2012-13 academic year 
included participation from 100 student teams in the United 
States. And these teams collected almost 950,000 pounds 
of food — 177 percent of their original goal — to address 
short-term hunger relief. To create long-term solutions for 
those caught in the hunger cycle, teams taught families 
how to shop for healthy and affordable meals, decrease food waste, effectively manage personal budgets and build 
gardens as a sustainable food source. Nearly 30,000 indi-
viduals benefitted from these innovative programs. 
The overall team results were led by students from Oregon 
State University in Corvallis. The real winners in the Let’s Can 
Hunger competition, however, were the 173 food banks and 
pantries benefitting from this nationwide student endeavor.
In the U.S. — Labels for Education
The Labels for Education program, which provides  
educational supplies for the redemption of eligible product labels, has awarded more than $114 million in equipment 
and supplies to thousands of schools across the U.S. and 
Canada since its inception in 1973. The program currently 
has more than 31,000 active participants. In FY2013, the 
program continued its relationships with Campbell and other 
consumer product companies, increasing the number of items eligible for distribution in the program by more 
than 1,000.
In addition, the new e-labels initiative allows shoppers at a 
range of supermarkets to register their frequent shopper 
cards and designate a beneficiary school. Each time they 
purchase an item from an eligible manufacturer, the labels 
automatically get banked to the chosen school’s account, 
making clipping labels easier than ever. This new process allows youth and families to tap into their extended networks 
to support local schools and increase the number of oppor-
tunities for deserving schools to receive educational equipment 
they need. In FY2013, more than 329,000 registered shopper 
cards were enrolled in the program.

Producing Innovation
OPPORTUNITIES  |  76Innovation for Impact
For Campbell, innovation is the key to 
success, both in our business as a food 
company and in our work as a corporate 
citizen. As we strive to create healthy 
communities and combat the childhood 
obesity and hunger issues plaguing our 
society, we must think outside the can. 
Campbell has been doing just that through the creation of produce-to-  
donate products Just Peachy salsa, Plum Organics' Super Smoothie and 
Campbell Canada’s Nourish.
Just PeachyIn 2012, the Food Bank of South Jersey, a 
Feeding America food bank, was strug-
gling to meet the increased demand for 
its services from more than 171,000 
food-insecure local residents. Meanwhile, 
Eastern ProPak Farmers Cooperative was 
dumping 800,000 pounds of nutrition-
ally sound, but undersized and slightly blemished peaches each year, at a cost 
of $80,000. From that, a peach of an 
idea, Just Peachy salsa, was born.
A team of Campbell volunteers developed 
the recipe and donated the manufacturing 
expertise and facility, Eastern ProPak 
provided the peaches, while 10 Campbell 
suppliers donated packaging and ingre-dients. In addition, Campbell employees 
volunteered to box the salsa to ready it 
for distribution.
The result in FY2013 was 52,000 jars of 
Just Peachy salsa, which were produced 
and sold in 28 southern New Jersey retail 
outlets, including farmer’s markets, restau-
rants and select ShopRite stores. This 
volunteer effort has created a sustainable revenue stream, with 100 percent of the 
proceeds supporting the Food Bank of 
South Jersey and its nine hunger relief 
programs, garnering approximately 
$100,000 in revenue last year.
The Full Effect
The newest member of the Campbell family, Plum Organics believes that every 
child should receive proper nutrition from 
the very start of his or her life. But  
currently, more than 16 million American children, nearly one in five, are food insecure. Not only that, but it is recognized 
that ages 0 to 3 are the most critical years 
developmentally for children. The answer? 
Plum Organics’ The Full Effect — an initia-
tive dedicated to nourishing little ones in 
need throughout America. The  Full Effect  
name comes from the fundamental belief that when little ones are full of the right 
nutrients, they can live up to their full potential and have their full effect on 
the world. 
One of the signature initiatives of The 
Full Effect is the Super Smoothie pouch 
made with accessible organic super foods, 
including fruits, vegetables and grains 
that help fortify the diets of kids who 
don't get regular healthy meals. With the help of Plum Organics’ supply chain 
partners, the company expects over half 
a million Super Smoothies to be donated 
in FY2014. Donations of Super Smoothies  
and other Plum Organics products reach children in need across the nation through 
a small group of extraordinary nonprofit 
partners, including the Conscious Alliance, 
Convoy of Hope, Homeless Prenatal 
Program and Baby Buggy.

Nourish
In FY2011, a team of Campbell employees in Canada sought 
to create a product for donation that would aid in disaster 
relief situations. The result was Nourish, a nutrient-dense, 
meal-in-a-can that utilizes a whole grain grown exclusively in Canada. The product boasts a full serving of vegetables 
and fiber as well as 18 grams of protein for those who need 
it most. It is also ideal for disaster relief situations since it 
does not require water or need to be heated and has a 
pop-top lid.Since the product’s launch, more than 400,000 cans have been produced and donated to Food Banks Canada and,  
in FY2013, to Free the Children. We have also continued a 
three-year partnership with the World Food Programme to 
spread the message about hunger relief in our local com-
munities. In FY2013, Campbell Canada also continued a 
food bank purchase program for Nourish through Food 
Banks Canada making the product available for purchase 
at a minimal charitable rate.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  78Opportunity: Create a high-performance culture rooted in  
integrity, accountable for results and committed to a socially 
responsible and diverse workforce.
To ensure Campbell’s long-term success 
and to maximize shareholder value, we 
must strengthen our core business and 
expand into higher growth spaces. To accomplish this, we must enable each 
of our employees to perform at a high 
level, achieve ambitious goals and take 
ownership for their outcomes. We must 
also create a diverse and inclusive work 
environment that encourages innovation, 
leverages CSR and sustainability, recog-
nizes results and embodies our values.
Campbell’s evolution to a high-performance 
culture begins with each employee know -
ing and demonstrating the essential behaviors represented by our Leadership 
Model: Inspire Trust, Create Direction, 
Drive Decision-Making, Build Talent & 
Culture, Execute with Excellence and 
Own the Results. Our Leadership Model 
is a dynamic one, and it has evolved in recent years to underscore the shift in 
priorities brought about by our new 
strategic framework. Perhaps the most 
important change has been to put 
“Consumer First” at the center of the 
model, to reinforce the imperative of 
considering the interests of our consumers 
in everything we do. 
Our Values
While our Leadership Model guides the 
actions and behaviors of our employees, 
creating a high-performance culture at Campbell also depends on each employee 
living our shared values of Character, Competence, Courage and Teamwork. • Character: Inspiring trust, acting with integrity and taking accountability 
for our results and our people.
• Competence: Building a learning 
organization with diverse perspec-
tives, developing new capabilities 
to drive growth and innovation, and 
executing our plan with agility to 
deliver our business results.
• Courage: Generating bolder business ideas, challenging the status quo, 
managing conflict constructively, 
and embracing experimentation and calibrated business risk.
• Teamwork: Working together, operating as “One Team Plus” 
with an enterprise-wide mindset, 
and encouraging open and honest 
communication.
Campbell’s commitment to nourishing 
the culture of our Company is embodied in our leadership model, which focuses 
on our desire to build a safe, diverse, 
inclusive, engaged and socially respon-
sible workplace that delivers business 
results with integrity. As part of our annual 
performance management process, each 
employee is asked to set at least one 
individual objective that builds on our 
collective efforts to build and maintain such a workplace.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  79Holding Ourselves to the Highest Standards
Campbell’s compliance and ethics  
program, known as Winning With Integrity, 
reflects our conviction that conducting 
business in compliance with the law and 
the highest standards of business ethics 
is essential to our success. As reflected in 
our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, 
the foundation document of our program, employees share responsibility for ensur-
ing that the Winning With Integrity pledge 
is fulfilled every day, through each and 
every action taken — whether in the 
marketplace, the workplace or the  
community. The Winning With Integrity 
program equips our employees with the 
resources, tools and guidance to help us 
build a better Campbell. 
The Code outlines our Company’s basic 
standards and expectations, highlights 
important policies and summarizes certain 
fundamental legal requirements that our employees must follow. Each new 
employee receives a copy of the Code, 
which is available in multiple languages. 
In FY2013, we updated the entire Code 
and included new sections on expense 
reporting and personal and familial work -
place relationships. The updated version was approved by the CEO and the Board 
of Directors, announced and distributed to employees in their language of choice, 
and posted on the Company’s internal 
and external websites.In FY2013, we also integrated Bolthouse Farms, which we acquired in August 2012, 
into the Winning With Integrity program 
and began the integration of Plum 
Organics. In the first quarter of FY2014, 
we acquired Kelsen Group, an international 
maker of Danish butter cookies, which 
will be integrated into the program.
Ethics Education and Training
Each year, Campbell provides compre-
hensive online and in-person training for 
employees on core ethics and compliance issues and risk-based training tailored to 
the issues associated with employees’ 
specific job responsibilities. As part of 
the Winning With Integrity program, all 
employees are required to complete 
annual training on our Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics. This training, offered 
in multiple languages, is available online 
for most employees, but also offered in DVD format for employees in our manu-
facturing facilities. 
Corporate policies and guidelines, such 
as our Anti-Bribery Policy, Guidelines and 
Commitment Concerning Advertising to 
Children, Environmental Sustainability 
Policy and Human Rights Principles, are 
reviewed and revised, as necessary, each year. New policies are periodically issued

At Campbell, The Way We Work   
represents our collective efforts to build 
a safe, diverse, inclusive, engaged and 
socially responsible company that delivers 
business results with integrity. The Way We

for their contributions. 
Measuring Performance & Engagement
For years Campbell has measured 
employee engagement across the orga-
nization, but as we seek to transform our culture, we have added a focus on our 
progress toward high performance. In  
2012, we piloted a new employee survey 
called Drive, which measures employees’ 
engagement as well as their perceptions 
of Campbell’s business performance, 
product and service quality, marketplace 
orientation, communication and training. 
The results of our Drive Survey are used 
to guide top-level change in support of 
our strategic priorities and to further 
develop our high-performance culture. 
Our initial Drive Survey identified corpo-
rate decision-making as an area in need 
of additional clarity and transparency. 
With this feedback, Campbell instituted 
and established training around a new decision-making model designed to 
increase agility and clarify roles in the 
decision-making process. At that time, we also added “Drive Decision-Making” 
to our Leadership Model and “Courage” to our Campbell Values, in order to 
further emphasize our employees’ 
decision-making capabilities. 
In 2013, we formally launched the Drive 
Survey to all salaried employees and to 
approximately half the employees in our 
manufacturing facilities. From the results 
of this broader survey, we identified the 
need to emphasize the role and impor-
tance of accountability in our employees’ 
behaviors. “Own the Results” replaced 
“Produce Extraordinary Results” in our 
Leadership Model to signify to employees 
the importance of owning successes 
and taking accountability for failures. Accountability was further reinforced 
when it was included as one of the four 
key elements of perform — a redesigned 
performance management process that 
was launched in August 2013, at the 
beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. Under 
the new perform process, employees are 
held accountable — through assessment 
and reward — for setting ambitious  
outcome-based objectives and delivering 
meaningful results within their roles.
Meaningful and Timely Company News
Communication is a key ingredient in 
bringing our culture activities to life, and 
we utilize a number of communication 
vehicles to engage and inform our employ -
ees around topics ranging from business 
results to volunteer efforts and events. 
Our online publication, Campbell Today,

Each year, Pepperidge Farm holds 
an Innovation Fair, encouraging employees to submit their best and brightest ideas for new products. The Innovation Fair is a great opportunity for people to unleash their creativity, and its purpose — innovation — is critical to the future of our business. In FY2013, the fair showcased almost 60 ideas and featured concepts and prod-ucts from Pepperidge Farm and Campbell teams from locations all across the U.S. and around the world — including Canada, Europe, Australia and Indonesia. 
Cash prizes were awarded for the 
winning entries, and several Inno-vation Fair ideas have gone all the way to store shelves.

performance, and strategies directly from President and 
CEO Denise Morrison and other senior leaders. Employees 
also utilize the workplace social network Yammer to share 
news and engage in discussion on a more “grassroots” level. 
At our local facilities, employees receive regular communica-
tion updates from their managers during team meetings and 
shift huddles. Cascading information from the corporate 
suite down to our individual plants helps ensure that employ -
ees understand our strategy, how it impacts them, where 
to prioritize their efforts and how their work fits into the 
larger picture.
Rewarding Performance
Peer recognition is an important part of building a high- 
performance culture. A number of employee recognition 
programs on both a local and national level are designed 
to identify and reward employees whose contributions and actions make a difference. 
Campbell’s Extraordinary Performance Awards — our  
premier, Company-wide recognition program — recognizes 
and rewards individual employees and teams for results 
that directly support our business strategies, leadership 
model and values. Awards also are presented to individuals 
and teams in recognition of leadership in community and 
sustainability efforts, and in diversity and inclusion activities. The highlight of the annual program is the presentation of the Dr. John T. Dorrance Award, the Company’s highest honor, which recognizes outstanding business results and 
innovative thinking. Established in 1994, the Dorrance Award 
is typically bestowed on a Campbell business team that 
has achieved exemplary performance in the marketplace.
Many of our business units and functions also offer regional 
recognition programs. The Asia-Pacific region, for example, 
bestows the Leading With Integrity Award each year on 
those Arnott’s leaders who consistently exemplify integrity, character, competence and teamwork. Campbell also offers 
a unique online recognition program that allows our employ -
ees to formally thank one another for making a difference at any time of the year. Recipients of these Make a Difference 
(MAD) awards receive a gift card and a certificate to display 
in their work areas. In FY2013, more than 2,600 MAD  
peer-to-peer awards were granted.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  83Our Benefits Philosophy
Campbell offers an array of resources to 
help employees manage their health and 
take accountability for their well-being so 
they may thrive at work, at home and in 
the community. We provide a competitive 
benefits package that enables employees 
to reach their personal and professional 
goals. This holistic approach encourages a healthy work/life balance, and helps our 
employees to proactively manage health, 
career and financial milestones. 
High-Performance Organization
The health and productivity of our 
employees supports our commitment to 
drive a high-performance organization. At 
Campbell, employees are accountable for 
managing their health, and the Company 
fosters this behavior by providing various 
tools and resources that support productivity, 
performance and employee well-being.
Managing Health
Campbell values the health of our employees 
and their families and provides valuable 
tools and resources to help them become 
informed so they can proactively manage 
their health and wellness. These tools 
include a health assessment, lifestyle 
coaching, provider quality comparisons, a 
smoking cessation program and an onsite fitness facility. By completing a confidential 
health assessment, employees can better 
understand the key indicators of their cur-
rent health profile and any potential risks. 
This assessment then connects participants 
to relevant in-person and online wellness 
programs to address identified issues. Eligible employees also may utilize Active Lifestyle Coaching, which provides access 
to a health coach for extra support to 
facilitate the achievement of personal 
health goals. 
Employees with certain conditions can call 
Medical Decision Support to access per-sonalized medical information and obtain 
provider quality comparisons for treatments. 
Medical Decision Support program also 
provides employees with confidential 
assistance for the management of chronic conditions such as low back pain, coronary 
artery disease, diabetes and sleep disorders. 
Campbell offers a smoking cessation  
program, the Quit for Life Program, which 
provides phone counseling and nicotine 
replacement therapy if needed. 
In addition, employees may join the onsite, 
state-of-the-art fitness facility at the World 
Headquarters location, where personal 
training sessions and exercise classes are 
offered. We also provide corporate dis-
counts to other fitness facility chains.
Total Rewards and Wealth Creation
Campbell offers a competitive market-based 
Total Rewards program. The compensation program is market-based and performance- 
driven. Employees are evaluated annually 
through our Performance Management 
process, which links objectives with measur-
able business outcomes. The goal of the 
program is to reward individual contributions 
differentially based on the outcomes of

plan, which allows U.S. employees to save for their futures 
and receive Company contributions. This plan offers multi-
ple investment choices that employees choose based on 
their personal goals and individual risk tolerance. 
Work/Life Balance
Campbell helps employees balance their work and personal 
commitments through flexible work arrangements and other resources, including: 
• Your Life Resources, which offers 24-hour access to counseling on personal, emotional, workplace, parent-
ing, legal and other issues.• LifeCare, which provides information on everyday  
challenges such as budgeting for personal finances, 
locating daycare or elder care, and searching  
for colleges.
• Stress management resources are also provided through 
multiple channels, including Your Life Resources, online 
coaching modules and the Medical Decision Support 
personalized kits mailed to employees’ homes.
At World Headquarters, on-site daycare is available to assist 
working parents in balancing professional and parenting 
priorities. Campbell also offers concierge services to acquire 
event tickets, arrange for pet sitters, make restaurant reser-
vations and more. We also offer an on-site credit union.

2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Organizational transformations 
start with people — something that Mark Engle, Campbell’s  Vice President of IT Enterprise Application Services, has taken  to heart. As Campbell continues evolving into a high-performance organization, Mark has taken it upon himself to become a high-performing individual.
“In 2012, I realized I wanted to better balance my health, my personal life and my work life,” he says, “so I created a 90-day plan to really focus on my physical, emotional and mental improvement.”
As part of his Individual Development Plan that year, Mark began 
a training program through the Human Performance Institute (HPI) in Orlando, Florida. And not just for his well-being — he also wanted to determine whether the Institute's expertise in performance psychology, exercise physiology and nutrition could help other Campbell employees with lifelong behavioral changes. 
HPI has an exercise about writing your “old story” versus your 
“new story” — writing down what is ultimately important to you and what you can do to make that happen. Mark’s new story centered around family, health and community. He thought he was healthy, but wasn’t as healthy as he could be; he thought he helped in the community, but really only donated money. Now Mark gives more of his time to the Cathedral Kitchen in Camden. 
Mark’s journey started by adjusting his eating and exercise habits. 
He swapped out the junk food for frequent high-protein “mini-meals,” and began a four-day-a-week workout routine, often accompanied by daughter Kelsey Engle, a Campbell Customer Service Analyst, who frequently worked out with him.
Those changes alone produced big results. Today, Mark is 50 pounds 
lighter, well beyond the five to seven pounds he originally wanted to lose. But it didn’t come without a few sacrifices along the way — Mark finally decided to give up his cigar habit on March 25, 2013. 
Mark’s plan didn’t just involve eating and exercise, however. He also 
wanted to make some positive behavioral changes as well. Conflict management was one focus area, so he began working on adopt-ing a more positive and patient approach — everything from his interactions in one-on-one situations to driving in traffic. 
“This has been a wonderful experience for me, and I would encourage 
everyone to really focus on what’s important in their lives and try to live to the fullest,” says Mark, who is now working with Human Resources to make this life-changing plan more broadly available to Campbell employees.
Family, friends and co-workers have all seen Mark’s energy since 
starting the program, and he’s now offering coaching and support for others making lifestyle changes. For instance: 
• Guy Critelli, Director IT Business Services, has lost 35 pounds and gained new perspective on balancing work, life and family, especially now that he is a grandfather.
• Mike Bizzoco, Director of IT Business Engagement for Campbell North America Sales, has lost 17 pounds.
• John Yecco, former Controller for Campbell North America, has changed his eating habits and continues to lose weight.
• Ajay Dhingra, a vendor from KHOJ who interacts with Mark regularly, has lost 50 pounds.
Peggy Pistilli, a Senior Executive Assistant in IT, provides the ultimate compliment on Mark’s newfound commitment. Peggy has long been passionate about working out, but after talking with Mark about his approach to incorporating personal health, mental health and lifestyle balance into one holistic routine, all she could say is “Mark is my idol.”
That type of admiration for Mark’s work earned him the World 
Headquarters 2013 Healthy Lifestyle Award, which recognizes Campbell employees who demonstrate a healthful lifestyle and have a positive influence on their peers. Joe Spagnoletti, Campbell’s Chief Information Officer, presented the award to Mark at a Town Hall meeting and praised his inspiring performance.
“Mark’s impact has gone far beyond reaching his personal goals,” 
Spagnoletti said. “He has inspired his family, colleagues and business partners to strive to live a healthier lifestyle. Additionally, he is thriving as a leader and challenging others to achieve their very best.”
Mark remains modest about his accomplishments and recognizes 
that he didn’t do it alone. “The award was quite a humbling expe-rience for me,” he admits. “At the beginning I had no intention of influencing others. But when people started noticing the healthy changes in my life, I realized that I couldn’t let up because I didn’t want them to see me fail. Those discussions really helped keep me accountable.”
And Mark continues to be accountable, too. “I still maintain a 
personal 90-day plan, and write in a journal when I succeed or fail in one of my commitments,” he says. “And I’m still working on intentionally investing my full and best energy — right here, right now.”

OPPORTUNITIES  |  86Developing Talent and Managing Performance
Creating a high-performance culture at 
Campbell means providing the resources 
and tools needed to enable and empower 
our employees not only to do their best 
work, but to grow, learn and develop their 
careers. We understand that this is a long-term commitment and requires varied 
programs that can provide opportunities 
through experience, feedback, coaching 
and learning. 
Campbell offers a variety of learning 
opportunities to employees based on their role in the organization. All employ -
ees are offered programs designed to help develop their careers, maximize 
their contributions within their roles and 
develop the requisite skills to perform 
more effectively. Specialized training is 
also available to employees within certain 
functions to build competencies needed 
to perform day-to-day duties. Managers of people receive additional training to 
enhance managerial quality — including 
change management, performance man-
agement and coaching. Additionally, select 
leadership groups may take advantage 
of programs to enhance leadership 
capabilities and reinforce Campbell’s 
leadership principles. 
Our online talent management system 
allows employees worldwide to manage 
their personal development and career 
goals. Using the system, employees  
can enter and update their annual job objectives, create and track individual development plans based on career 
aspirations and skills, and receive feed-
back and insights from their managers. 
The system also provides Campbell’s 
leadership teams with real-time data that 
helps inform key talent decisions in the areas of succession, global mobility and 
development investments.
In addition, Campbell’s Tuition Assistance 
Program has provided more than $1 million 
to eligible employees in the U.S. who 
completed courses at accredited schools to enhance skills associated with their 
roles at Campbell. 
Managing Performance for a  
High-Performance Culture
Creating a high-performance culture is 
a key enabler of Campbell’s business 
strategies. To achieve consistent high 
performance, however, we understand that we need to enable employees with 
the resources, management and incen-
tives they need to raise the level of their 
individual contributions. Just prior to 
the start of FY2014, we introduced a 
new performance management system 
at Campbell called perform. This new 
approach holds employees accountable 
for setting ambitious, outcome-based objectives, establishes a framework 
for year-round manager feedback and 
coaching, and rewards employees who 
make meaningful contributions to the 
business, their functions or their teams.

Campbell University offers our entire workforce programs 
for learning and career development through a variety of 
media, including classroom-based courses, webinars, pod-
casts and self-paced e-learning options. In FY2013, Campbell 
University launched an online learning management system 
called CUonline, which allows employees and their managers 
to build individual training plans, view and register for 
available sessions and track completed courses. 
The Campbell Way for Managing 
Managers play a pivotal role in employee engagement, 
development and overall performance. We put a tremendous emphasis on developing superior management skills because 
we believe that the quality of our managers helps define 
and shape our relationship with Campbell employees and 
stakeholders. The Campbell Way for Managing program 
focuses on building key manager capabilities, such as iden-
tifying talent, offering feedback and coaching, performance 
management and change management.
The Campbell Way for Managing program is a mix of  classroom and virtual learning for managers, designed to 
create consistency across the enterprise. The Campbell Way 
for Managing is a six-month curriculum aimed at clarifying 
and defining the expectations of a Campbell manager, 
allowing new managers to practice effective people man-
agement skills and creating a “network” of new managers 
to support one another after the program ends. This focus 
on manager consistency and quality helps Campbell build employee engagement and productivity and creates a 
richer workplace environment.

Culture & Ethics: 
Diversity & Inclusion
OPPORTUNITIES  |  88Re-energizing our Commitment to Diversity & Inclusion
A diverse and inclusive Campbell helps us 
create innovative products for a rapidly 
evolving consumer base, deepens our 
knowledge around cultural insights and 
sensitivities, attracts top talent and 
reduces costs through decreased turn-
over and absenteeism. Most importantly, 
diversity is a strategic imperative for any consumer goods business today. 
The U.S. Census Bureau projects that  
85 percent of the population growth  
in the United States between 2011 and 
2050 will be in nonwhite ethnic groups, 
and that women currently impact up to 
85 percent of all consumer purchasing 
decisions. We want Campbell to reflect 
the changing face of our consumers so 
that we can develop products that meet 
their diverse needs and tastes. 
Reinvigorating our diversity and inclusion 
(D&I) programs will help Campbell meet 
these challenges. We began this process 
in 2012, by realigning and restructuring 
our D&I team and working to establish 
cross-functional relationships with 
Talent Acquisition, Legal, CSR, Global 
Communications and our business 
functions. We then focused on develop-
ing a new strategy that embodies our Company values, The Way We Work and 
our business priorities. We accomplished 
this by conducting a comprehensive 
assessment, including Listening Tours 
(focus groups with employees on all 
levels from a diversity of functions), 
executive interviews, research of next 
and best industry practices, and a deep 
analysis of workforce representation 
and retention trends.We then socialized and validated our 
strategy across the organization by 
incorporating insights, ensuring align-
ment with Campbell’s business priorities 
and further narrowing our focus.
Strategy Implementation
Our ultimate goal is to create an inclusive environment, rich in diverse people, talent 
and ideas, to fuel our growth and create 
a high-performance culture driven by 
engaged employees. 
During the coming year, we will continue 
to implement our strategy, which we 
believe will create an organization where 
diversity and inclusion is embraced as a 
core value and leveraged to create com-
petitive advantage for Campbell. Our 
areas of focus include:
• Reigniting Leadership from the Top: Provide our executives and people 
managers with the tools, information 
and expertise needed to build an 
authentically inclusive culture.
• Attracting and Retaining Top 
Diverse Talent: Leverage workforce 
plans to increase representation of 
women and professionals of color 
on all levels of our organization. 
• Increasing Campbell’s D&I Capability 
and Accountability: Partner with 
Campbell University to build/increase 
organizational capabilities around 
unconscious bias, cultural compe-
tence and inclusive leadership with 
Data Services to develop reporting 
plans to increase awareness, measure 
progress and drive accountability.

Business Resource Affinity Networks (BRANs)
Our Business Resources Affinity Networks, or BRANs, are a 
key way we encourage and support D&I at Campbell. These 
employee-led, Company-supported volunteer organizations 
help us focus and connect with our increasingly diverse 
employee and consumer bases — both of which deliver sustainable business results. We currently have eight BRANs, each sponsored by a member 
of our CEO’s Corporate Leadership Team.
• Bridge Network is focused on building an adaptive 
workplace that fosters trusted generational and cross- 
functional partnerships as a means to develop talent 
and fuel innovation.

• Women of Campbell (WoC) strives to help all women at 
Campbell achieve and demonstrate their full potential. 
This network’s objective is to create an environment of 
growth, advancement and successful attraction and 
retention of female talent.
Campbell BRANs help us demonstrate our commitment to 
The Way We Work and ensure that we are the employer and 
business partner of choice for our customers, consumers, 
communities and shareholders. 
Some of our featured BRAN events in FY2013 included:
• Philly’s Men Are Cookin’: The Campbell African American 
Network (CAAN) was the primary sponsor of the 21st 
annual Philly’s Men Are Cookin’ fundraiser. This event 
is a fundraising opportunity for the Alpha Kappa 
Alpha-sponsored Ivy Legacy Foundation — an education

safety results. Our Safety Leadership Team 
establishes direction and provides 
leadership in executing the plan, which includes:
• The development and implementation of global safety standards, includ-
ing technology and online tools that 
help communicate safety measures 
clearly and consistently to our 
global workforce. 
• Safety training for our 12,000 supply chain employees outside our Camden 
location, with more than 5,400 also 
receiving OSHA #501 advanced train-
ing on ergonomics — preventing slips 
and falls and other topics. 
• Annual regional safety conferences to share best practices and develop 
local safety teams.
• Annual three-day audits of all 
locations, focusing on programs, 
conditions and behaviors.
• Safety recognition at Global 
Leadership Team meetings and 
through our worldwide Extraordinary 
Performance Awards. To ensure safety in the workplace, our employees must be fully engaged and 
trained in appropriate safety procedures. 
Safety systems are embedded into  
manufacturing plant operations through employee engagement initiatives, such as our Daily Direction Setting process. Each

Campbell’s safety focus has allowed us to exceed industry 
benchmarks for several years. According to the Bureau of 
Labor statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor, through 
2011 our industry averaged 1.4 lost-time incidents for every 
200,000 hours worked. In FY2013, however, Campbell’s 
rate was only 0.32. In addition, Campbell’s occupational 
injury and illness frequency rate per 200,000 hours was 
2.39 in FY2013, whereas the industry average for the 2011 
data year was 5.8.
External Benchmarking
In order to ensure that global safety best practices are integrated into our systems, our Global Safety Leadership 
Team continually benchmarks our results against those  
of other organizations and recognized industry leaders 
through the Food Industry Safety Peer Group. Benchmarking 
activities with our peer group help identify opportunities 
for us to strengthen key safety systems. Campbell has also 
leveraged relationships with industry leaders in the area of 
ergonomics, fall protection, information management systems, 
employee motivation and professional development to drive continuous improvement.
Recognizing Safety Achievements
Beyond tracking and improving injury and illness rates, 
Campbell recognizes employees and teams when they 
reach important safety milestones. Our Safety Flag Program 
recognizes Campbell facilities where safety systems have 
kept employees free of lost-time injuries for at least one year or more than one million work hours. Today, 14 of Campbell’s 
24 manufacturing sites proudly fly the Safety Flag, many 
with gold Campbell “C”s added for reaching additional  
million-hour milestones. Additionally, Campbell’s Global Safety Excellence Award recognizes up to four Campbell 
facilities each year for their ongoing efforts to ingrain 
workplace safety into their cultures. Plants are evaluated 
based on a number of criteria, and the winning facilities 
are recognized each year in June as part of National Safety 
Month. The FY2013 winning plant sites were Napoleon, 
Ohio; Aiken, South Carolina; and Shepparton, Australia.

At Campbell, we are committed to  
delivering uncompromised value to 
customers and consumers. We seek to 
enhance the quality of our products and 
brands, not only by who or what we 
source from but also by how we source. By incorporating sustainable and respon-
sible practices, we envision a supply 
chain that minimizes exposure to risk, 
promotes long-term growth, improves 
economic savings and reaffirms our 
position as CSR stewards.
Our Global Supply Chain is responsible for 
all aspects of procuring and producing 
Campbell’s products in order to stock the 
store shelves and kitchen cabinets of the 
world. As a multinational organization, our 
journey toward world-class excellence 
begins with our secret ingredient: 
Campbell people. Our employees collab -
orate with our suppliers, business teams, 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 
industry peers and trade partners in order 
to optimize our supply chain in an ethical 
and responsible manner. We partner with 
these groups to identify, understand and 
address sustainability challenges and 
emerging trends within the industry.
Together, we will form a world-class supply 
chain organization that continuously 
improves and supports sustainable growth, 
savings and innovation, while reducing 
Total Delivered Cost (TDC).Since Campbell’s global supply chain is 
both complex and diverse, our team is 
continually focused on safety, quality, 
ethical and responsible sourcing, TDC 
and environmental sustainability within 
the chain, in addition to maintaining excellent customer service.
We consider our suppliers to be critical 
partners in the success of our business and 
expect them to conduct their operations 
in a manner that is consistent with our 
own ethics and values. We require them to adhere to applicable laws and regula-
tions while encouraging excellence beyond 
baseline requirements where possible 
to reduce environmental impacts and 
improve social accountability.
To optimize our corporate value chain, we 
apply the same stringent standards to our 
vendors that we place on ourselves, while sourcing the highest-quality ingredients 
our consumers have come to expect. 
To deliver these results, we are focused 
on initiatives that educate, engage and 
impact suppliers in ways that help 
them recognize and address sustain-
ability challenges in an ever-changing 
global environment. 
Our current supply chain priorities include 
total delivered cost (TDC); quality and 
innovation; customer engagement, service

OPPORTUNITIES  |  94Setting Expectations and Managing Performance
Because corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) is an integral mission at Campbell, 
we require our suppliers to follow rigorous 
CSR and sustainability standards. 
Campbell’s Supply Base Requirements 
and Expectations Manual, developed 
in 1988 and updated annually, identi-
fies the expectations and requirements for firms that are (and aspire to be) 
Campbell suppliers. 
The Manual’s requirements are designed 
to help current and potential brokers, co-packers, re-packers, special packers, 
suppliers, warehouses and licensees meet 
Campbell’s CSR and sustainability objec-
tives. Adherence and performance to 
these expectations are essential factors 
when entering into or extending existing 
business relationships with Campbell. 
Requirements within the Manual cover a 
diverse array of subjects, including legal compliance, health and safety, human 
rights, quality, governance, animal welfare, 
environmental issues and other CSR-
related topics. Employment standards are 
of particular concern to Campbell. The 
Manual lays out prescriptive requirements 
for the following areas: 
• Minimum employment age
• Voluntary labor
• Wages and benefits
• Working hours and rest
• Discrimination
• Freedom of association
• Fair treatmentIn the event of noncompliance or non-adherence to our Expectations Manual, 
suppliers must develop a formal corrective 
action plan — allowing Campbell to 
directly engage with the supply chain 
on CSR and sustainability performance.
Engaging Our Suppliers 
We review and monitor our global supply 
chain through a formal supply mapping 
system that provides us with a holistic 
view of our entire supply chain. This 
system identifies opportunity areas that allow us to collaborate with suppliers to 
improve functionality and sustainability, 
while driving cost savings. 
Campbell collaborates with key strategic 
suppliers on sustainability issues through 
our Strategic Supplier Relationship 
Management (SRM) Program. SRM 
enhances and expands our regular com-munication and idea exchanges with select 
suppliers, engaging them on topics such 
as sustainability projects, best practices 
and benchmarking, while addressing 
emerging trends in ethical and responsible 
sourcing. Our ultimate goal is to leverage 
these critical relationships for a mutual 
good — not only to grow Campbell’s 
own business, but the businesses of our strategic suppliers as well.

Implementing SRM has already delivered valuable information 
to Campbell that has impacted our approach to corporate 
social responsibility. In turn, we’ve been very successful in 
engaging our suppliers and business partners to become more 
focused on meeting Campbell’s sourcing and sustainability 
objectives, helping both sides drive corporate citizenship.
Delivering Results Through SRM
Through partnerships with key strategic suppliers, we have 
already yielded favorable outcomes in sustainability and cost savings. By identifying synergies between our companies, 
Campbell and our suppliers have delivered sustainable wins 
in the palm oil, cocoa and flour supply chains.
We have developed strategies in these ingredient categories 
to optimize and establish best practices in sustainability and 
responsible sourcing. These wins include:
• Identification of a strategic road map that will ensure sustainably sourced palm oil as we increase to 100 percent certified sustainable palm oil by 2015;
• Increased capacity building and resource allocation to responsible sourcing initiatives;
• Engagement with NGOs on supply chain mapping;
• Significant economic savings and carbon footprint 
reduction in optimized logistics operations; and
• Exploration of sustainable agricultural practices.
Campbell also engages with other suppliers beyond our key 
strategic supplier network through a variety of methods 
and on a variety of topics. These include discussions with 
senior management, policy input solicitation, assessment 
surveys and other external surveys. Implementing Supplier StandardsCampbell has developed several formal processes for  
identifying, tracking and monitoring sustainability programs 
within our supply chain, including annual updates to the 
Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual  
and ongoing implementation of our Supplier Sustainability Scorecard. 
Campbell began measuring the effectiveness of our supplier 
sustainability program using a Supplier Sustainability 
Scorecard. The Scorecard, which initially captured environ-
mental performance metrics, has evolved to include benchmarking of social responsibility efforts to better 
understand the policies and practices of our supply base.
The Scorecard allows Campbell to benchmark and identify 
supply chain opportunities — particularly in areas where 
Campbell can directly engage suppliers on sustainability. 
We expect that the Scorecard will become a competitive 
differentiator when reviewing future supplier relationships. 
In FY2014, we are planning to develop a pilot project using 
the Supplier Sustainability Scorecard as a measurement 
tool in the tracking and evaluation of CSR performance. 
In addition, on-site audits, derived directly from the Supply 
Base Requirements and Expectations Manual, are comprised 
of 26 key sections with 195 questions to be completed by a 
Campbell-certified auditor. All direct material suppliers are 
subject to our performance management process, which 
includes continuous monitoring of the risk they may present 
to our business. Follow-up audits and assessments are con-
ducted based on the risk potential of supply interruption. 
We complete more than 700 vendor audits per year using rigorous standards that include CSR and sustainability 
requirements. In addition to our internal auditors, we have 
also initiated third-party audits to keep accountability and 
performance high.

Finally, all Campbell plants and contract manufacturers are 
now required to obtain third-party certifications for Global 
Food Safety Initiative-recognized Food Safety and Quality 
systems. Campbell North America manufacturing plants 
were certified in 2009, while our international and core 
contract manufacturer plants were certified in 2010. In 
addition, in 2011 Campbell outlined its supplier expecta-
tions and performance in accordance with California’s 
Human Trafficking and Slavery in the Supply Chain law.
Managing Noncompliance
As part of our robust supply chain standards, we include 
stringent policies and procedures for noncompliance. We 
have processes, documentation tools and software systems 
established for reporting individual ingredient and direct 
food packaging nonconformance. This allows us not only 
to identify issues, but also to directly engage suppliers in 
corrective action plans, timing and documentation. Ongoing 
nonconformance trends are monitored and, when appropri-ate, an improvement plan is established to address supplier 
or material performance issues. 
Based on possible regulatory actions, nonconformance risk 
or frequency of occurrence, suppliers may be subject to a 
Campbell audit that focuses on necessary corrective actions 
and/or possible disqualification as a supplier. We conduct 
full and partial supplier audits each year to address a variety 
of sourcing issues — including those covering social and environmental sustainability. Audit benefits include helping 
us to identify whether a supplier has the correct policies 
and procedures in place to address sustainability issues, 
and whether they have documentation allowing Campbell 
to identify and track products through the supply chain. 
Finally, consistent processes are also in place to link 
consumer product complaints to specific ingredients  
or packaging materials.Managing Risk
We have a formalized supply chain risk management process 
in place. In the event of a business interruption at any point, each supply chain input team has developed a plan that 
includes a comprehensive outline of production alternatives. 
Our methodology consists of three parts: risk identification, 
risk analysis and risk mitigation.
Our most important risks and opportunities will vary from 
year to year. Campbell has identified “hot spots” within our 
supply chain with respect to sustainability issues, and works 
actively with our suppliers to address them. Currently, our most important risks are associated with the rising cost of 
raw materials, impacts to climate and deforestation, and 
ethical sourcing standards. Our risk analysis model not only includes sustainability as a factor but also financial 
and supply risks associated with our categories.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  97Addressing Our Supply Chain Challenges
As a food and beverage company, we are 
often challenged by non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and others con-
cerned about the safety, security and 
quality of our products as well as the 
ethical standards we apply to suppliers. 
We work closely with suppliers, industry 
and professional associations, academic institutions and other outside experts  
to identify new and emerging issues in 
chemical, food safety and packaging 
technologies to ensure our ingredients and 
packaging materials conform to the most rigorous scientific and technical standards.
When there is an issue or challenge, we 
often work directly with the external party, 
frequently an NGO, to better understand 
its concerns, communicate our position 
and provide information, and, when 
appropriate, take corrective action. Over 
the past several years, we’ve engaged with NGOs such as the Humane Society 
of the United States, the Rainforest Action 
Network and the Interfaith Center on 
Corporate Citizenship, among others, on a 
variety of issues both directly and indirectly 
related to our business operations. 
Palm Oil
Palm oil is used in products such as cookies and crackers. Many NGOs are 
concerned that the industry harms fragile 
ecosystems and impacts local communi-
ties by expanding industrialized palm oil 
plantations. As a food company, Campbell 
recognizes the connection between the 
long-term vitality of our business and the 
imperative to advance environmental 
sustainability. We understand that unsustainable palm oil can have serious social and environmental impacts.
Both Campbell and our palm oil suppliers 
are members of the Roundtable on 
Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a group 
composed of palm growers, palm oil users, 
retail food chains and NGOs. The RSPO was created to promote the development 
and use of sustainable palm oil through 
supply chain cooperation and an open 
dialogue with stakeholders. As a company, 
Campbell is working with our suppliers to ensure that the palm oil we source is 
derived from sustainable practices. 
As part of our commitment to sustainable 
sourcing and responsible land manage-
ment, we have developed goals to mitigate 
our impact in these areas, especially in 
the area of deforestation. 
Campbell Soup Company Statement 
and Action on Deforestation
• We recognize that deforestation is seen as a key contributor to global 
greenhouse gas emissions.
• Unsustainable cultivation and  management of some of our raw 
materials such as palm oil, soy, paper 
and beef have the potential to degrade remaining tropical rainforests.
• As part of our commitment to  
environmental stewardship, Campbell 
has set targets to source palm oil 
sustainably, and to work with a 
range of our suppliers to drive more 
sustainable sourcing for other ingre-
dients and packaging to help achieve 
zero net deforestation by 2020.

Supply Chain: 
Challenges
Campbell completed its 
initial certification audit  
and became a member  
of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil  
in 2013.SECTION  |  98
2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
 OPPORTUNITIES  |  98
2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
• Campbell has set targets to purchase 100 percent  
certified sustainably sourced palm oil by 2015. The  
certification for palm oil will be through the Roundtable 
on Sustainable Palm Oil or equivalent standard. 
• We will develop responsible sourcing guidelines for different commodities in our products. The guidelines 
will define how we approach forest stewardship and 
our zero net deforestation goal.
• Campbell will also set annual improvement goals and  milestones for each commodity related to deforestation and update stakeholders on progress through our annual 
CSR Report and regular communication tools.
To ensure that no deforestation or degradation occurs 
from the sourcing of our raw materials, we must work with 
stakeholders in our supply chain, from farmers, processors 
and suppliers all the way to consumers. Campbell will 
especially work with suppliers in high-risk regions to help 
comply with our principles and guidelines. We will work with key strategic suppliers in our supply chain to understand 
and investigate the mapping of our palm oil. We will also 
work with other stakeholders including NGOs, governments 
and local communities where we source. Achieving this 
goal requires Campbell to protect forests and ecosystems 
that supply materials and to designate an appropriate 
management response where we directly control these areas.
This shift to sustainable agriculture is mutually beneficial, 
as it increases yields for farmers and lowers costs, while 
passing along savings to companies and consumers.
Actionable Goals
To confirm our commitment to sustainable sourcing and 
responsible land management we set the following goals:
• Set targets to purchase certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO)
 —Purchase 50 percent of our palm oil that is CSPO  
by 2013.
 —Purchase 75 percent of our palm oil that is CSPO  by 2014.
 —Purchase 100 percent of our palm oil that is CSPO  by 2015.• Purchase 100 percent CSPO through a combination of segregated where feasible and mass balance as 
we strive toward a fully segregated supply chain with 
clear transparency and traceability. The certification of 
palm oil will be through the Roundtable on Sustainable 
Palm Oil or equivalent.
• Develop responsible sourcing guidelines for palm oil in our products that will define how we approach forest 
stewardship and how to achieve zero net deforestation.
• Engage and work with other stakeholders including 
NGOs, governments and local communities in which 
we source.
Our Principles & Guidelines for Suppliers
Campbell will ensure that its palm oil sourced from forested 
areas adheres to the following guidelines:
• Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO): We will purchase from RSPO-certified suppliers (or equivalent standard) 
who adhere to the Roundtable's principles and criteria outlined on their website: http:/ /www.rspo.org/sites/
default/files/RSPO%20Principles%20&%20Criteria.pdf 
• Deforestation and Degradation
 —The purchased palm oil has not led to deforestation, 
degradation or the destruction of wildlife habitats, 
particularly for the conversion of natural forest 
to commercial use, urbanization or other land 
application.
 —The purchased palm oil will not contribute to the 
loss of High Conservation Values Areas (HCVA), as 
defined by the HCVA Resource Network.
 —The purchased palm oil will not harm or clear forest areas of “high carbon” value.
 —The purchased palm oil will not contribute to the destruction of peatlands or forests.
Supplier selection and resulting palm oil production will 
occur in compliance with the Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual as well as local and federal laws 
and regulations.

The Consumer Goods Forum
• The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) is an industry 
association that brings together more than 400 retailers, 
manufacturers, service providers and other stakeholders 
across 70 countries. It aims to increase industry collab-
oration on noncompetitive matters and supports the 
exchange of knowledge and good practice. Campbell 
President and CEO Denise Morrison is the Vice Chair of 
the board of directors of the CGF.
• Participating companies in the CGF agreed to mobilize 
their resources to help achieve zero net deforestation 
by 2020.
• The target is to create funding streams that incentivize 
forested countries to protect their natural environment, 
while enabling them to reach zero net deforestation 
and meet their own economic development goals.
Animal Welfare
Campbell is committed to the humane treatment of animals 
and believes that ethical sourcing is an important part of 
our vision for sustainable supply. 
In 2012, we developed an animal welfare policy that was 
integrated into our annual revision to the Supply Base 
Requirements and Expectations Manual. As we continue to 
advance our work with suppliers in responsible sourcing, 
Campbell is developing plans to eliminate gestation crates 
from its pork supply chain. With our suppliers’ engagement, 
we intend to reach that goal no later than 2022, although 
we are working toward progress by 2017. Campbell will 
continue to favor suppliers that raise hogs in a gestation crate-free environment, in addition to those suppliers 
that can provide audit and tracking reports for sourcing 
crate-free pork.Conflict MineralsIn FY2013, Campbell elevated engagement with suppliers that 
use conflict minerals in the production of certain packaging 
materials. Conflict minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten 
and gold, typically mined from the Democratic Republic of 
Congo and adjoining countries. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires 
certain annual disclosures for companies sourcing conflict 
minerals in the course of producing their products. Since Campbell does not use conflict minerals in the production of 
foods and beverages, we are not subject to these disclosure 
requirements. However, we are working to identify any of our suppliers that are subject to the SEC disclosure requirements 
and determine whether they have appropriate policies and 
reporting procedures in place. Already, we have determined 
that about 75 percent of our packaging suppliers do not use 
conflict minerals of any kind and are continuing to evaluate 
the remaining 25 percent.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  100Creating a More Diverse Supply Chain
As the demographics of our consumers 
continue to change, we are committed 
to assembling a supply base that reflects 
increasingly multicultural markets and helps 
us understand, relate to and anticipate 
customer demands. Progressive organi-
zations realize that supplier diversity and 
business results are inseparable — and that by fostering a rich pool of qualified, 
diverse suppliers, value is added to the 
business, and long-term growth objectives 
can be achieved. 
Our Diversity Program
Our U.S. supplier diversity program is 
designed to provide diverse suppliers 
equal access to potential business oppor-
tunities in an effort to strengthen our 
supply base, reflect the markets we serve 
and promote innovation. Diverse supply 
chain relationships strengthen our com-
petitive position, while contributing to our market share and total shareholder return.
In FY2013, Campbell exceeded its diversity 
spend goal with $161 million purchased 
from more than 250 women- and minority-  
owned suppliers. Since 2006, our diverse spend has increased at an average com-
pound annual growth rate of 8.3 percent 
with spend of more than $1 billion since program inception. In our continued efforts 
to be more reflective of the communities 
we serve, we have broadened our cate-
gories of diverse suppliers to include 
both veteran and LGBT (lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender) businesses. Supplier diversity is clearly more than 
just achieving a targeted spending goal. 
Campbell recognizes that supporting 
minority- and women-owned businesses 
can have a more far-reaching impact on 
the communities we serve. Our commit-
ment to supplier diversity has been a key 
driver in helping improve the capabilities of minority- and women-owned businesses 
across the United States. That in turn can 
strengthen local communities through 
employment opportunities, real-life role 
modeling for younger generations and fostering purchases from other diverse 
businesses.
In addition, there are significant and 
quantifiable benefits to Campbell.  
Our diverse supply base continues to demonstrate real and measurable value 
for the entire organization through:
• Competitive costs and quality 
improvements;
• Responsiveness and agility to adapt to changing business needs;
• Dedicated and enhanced customer service; and
• Fresh perspectives and new ways of thinking to promote innovation.

Promoting Supplier Diversity
Campbell also advocates for our diverse supply base beyond 
just fulfilling our own internal requirements. We participate on 
both a national and local level through corporate member -
ships and sponsorships at supplier diversity events with leading organizations such as the National Minority Supplier 
Development Council and the Women’s Business Enterprise 
National Council. We’ve awarded educational funding to 
local minority businesses to help elevate their business 
acumen. With three other major corporations, we recently funded a Food Marketing Institute white paper on the value 
proposition of supplier diversity specific to the food retail 
industry. We continue to work closely with our prime non-diverse businesses to enhance their existing supplier 
diversity programs, and in some cases, directly influence 
their own supply base.
At Campbell, we remain dedicated to our efforts around 
supplier diversity, and to using them to continue to connect 
with and support our multicultural consumers and commu-
nities. We know that by partnering with a variety of talented 
suppliers, we create an undeniable business advantage for Campbell, while also enabling positive opportunities for this 
diverse and dedicated group to succeed.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  102Sustainable Organization and Product Transport
We continue to make progress in reducing 
energy use and greenhouse gas emissions 
through our complex transportation fleet 
and logistics systems. We understand that 
transportation of raw materials, ingredients 
and finished products from farm to factory 
to stores presents multiple opportunities 
to create efficiencies.
A majority of our U.S. retail transportation 
is contractual and therefore impacts our 
Scope 3, or embedded, carbon impact. Our 
goals for reducing our carbon footprint include reductions of our Scope 3 emis-
sions through supply chain efficiencies. 
Because most of our transportation is 
provided through contracted carriers, 
reducing our carbon footprint requires 
cross-sector collaboration, cooperation 
on new approaches and the commitment 
of our shipping partners.
We are also aware of the debate and 
trends in seeking alternative transporta-
tion fuels, including those that may be 
derived with lower environmental impact. 
Our goal to reduce our environmental 
footprint extends through our supply 
network, and to achieve this we will 
collaborate with our customers and 
suppliers on those strategies. Our goal is to raise awareness and promote adop-
tion of more energy-efficient methods, 
inputs and fuels within our suppliers and 
across our transportation network. In 2014, we will continue to educate our suppliers 
and internal supply chain, while working 
with our business partners to continuously 
optimize efficiencies through multiple 
joint programs including:
• Increasing use of heavy payload equipment.
• Promoting the shift to alternative or 
lower environmental impact fuels, 
including exploring the use of com-
pressed natural gas in areas where 
infrastructure exists, working with 
customers to identify opportunities to convert loads to intermodal  
versus over-the-road.
• Reducing idle time in our facilities or 
at our customers.
• Ensuring that all our core U.S. retail carriers are SmartWay certified, with 
the goal of ensuring that, where prac-
tical, the remainder of our partners 
are qualified by the end of FY2014.
• Incorporating sustainability initiatives 
into our carrier sourcing criteria.
In FY2013, we continued to focus on 
increasing intermodal transportation. 
Currently, more than 65 percent of our 
U.S. retail internal, intermodal-capable 
shipments are intermodal. Intermodal 
freight shipping has become the No. 1 segment of all rail shipments. Each train 
can take up to 500 trucks off the highways 
and, on average, railways are more than 
three times more fuel-efficient than trucks.

Nearly 1 billion gallons of fuel per year could be saved if 
only 10 percent of the freight that currently moves by truck 
were moved by rail.
In addition, shifting freight from trucks to rail helps reduce 
highway congestion. Our 2013 achievements include:• Removing more than 20,000 trucks from the road, reducing CO2 emissions by more than 27,000 tonnes 
and saving more than 34,000 gallons of diesel fuel.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  104Opportunity: Advance an industry-leading sustainability  
strategy that decouples our business growth from our  
environmental footprint.
As one of the world’s leading manufacturers 
of high-quality, branded foods and bever-
ages, Campbell has long been concerned 
about resource stewardship. Throughout 
our 145-year history, Campbell has looked 
to conservation initiatives as a way to make our production facilities more efficient. 
Today our commitment to sustainability 
has evolved into a specific set of business 
strategies and goals that help us reduce 
our environmental footprint and better 
manage compliance, cost and efficiency. 
We take a precautionary approach to the environment by seeking to apply processes 
or practices with less environmental 
impact when possible. These efforts are 
centered on a primary goal: to cut the 
environmental footprint of our portfolio — 
defined as water and greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions per metric tonne of 
product — by 50 percent by 2020.
As we work toward this primary goal, 
we’ve integrated strategies throughout 
our global business operations to ensure 
the widest possible impact. We’ve also 
set supporting goals to help us track our 
progress. These 2020 goals, which gen-
erally track back to Campbell’s FY2008 
baseline data, keep us continually focused on providing sustainable business and 
stakeholder solutions:
• Reduce energy use by 35 percent and source 40 percent of our electricity 
from renewable or alternative energy 
sources
• Recycle 95 percent of waste  
generated globally
• Eliminate 100 million pounds of 
packaging from Campbell products
• Derive 100 percent of our global packaging materials from sustain-
able sources (renewable, recyclable or recycled content)
In FY2013, Campbell continued its progress 
toward meeting these 2020 goals. We 
reduced our GHG emissions by 4.4 percent 
year over year, recorded an 83.2 percent 
recycle rate across the enterprise and 
stayed on track to meet our 2020 water 
goal. We also took first steps on several significant new renewable energy projects, 
including an anaerobic waste-to-energy 
digester, five solar panel and two wind 
turbine projects. Combined, these projects 
will play a significant role in helping us 
realize our 2020 goals.

Achieving our 2020 environmental goals 
will require investment, measurement and 
engagement with a variety of stakeholders, 
from educating our employees on source 
separation for recyclables to working with 
suppliers on ways to reduce their GHG 
emissions. Over the past five years, we 
have worked diligently at strengthening our Environmental Management System 
(EMS) in order to measure performance, 
ensure compliance and integrate envi-
ronmental programs throughout our 
worldwide business operations. 
At the core of an effective EMS is strong 
governance and oversight. Campbell’s 
Board and CEO have chartered the 
Sustainability Leadership Team to lead 
the Company’s sustainability efforts 
and climate policy. This team, com-
prised of senior executives in charge 
of Environmental programs, Supply Chain, Procurement, Manufacturing, Agriculture, 
Packaging and Logistics, drives Campbell’s 
global climate strategy and was instru-
mental in helping establish our 2020 
sustainability goals. 
Annual presentations on the Company’s 
climate progress and sustainability status 
are made to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. These presentations 
cover progress on our energy use and 
GHG emissions, energy conservation 
projects, water use, wastewater treatment 
and solid waste recycling, as well as their 
resulting effects on climate change.
We use an environmental management 
software system designed to ensure that 
regulatory and corporate requirements are met. Campbell's Environmental 
Management & Metrics System (CEMMS)  
is used to collect and organize environ-mental documents (including corporate 
policies, permits and reports) and activities 
(monitoring, measurement and reporting) 
to ensure ongoing compliance with 
regulatory requirements and management system standards. The system is also 
able to identify, track and report on key 
environmental parameters.
We audit our manufacturing facilities on 
a rolling schedule to verify compliance 
with all environmental laws and Company 
policies. These audits align with the prac-
tices of the International Audit Protocol 
Consortium, and any corrective actions 
that are identified are tracked in CEMMS 
to ensure timely resolution.
Engaging Stakeholders on Sustainability
Part of our EMS process involves engaging 
others in our environmental goals and 
policies, as well as making significant 
capital investments that will help us 
achieve those goals. Campbell is an active 
member of several global groups that 
share the goals of advancing sustainable 
innovation in business operations, supply 
chain and products. Internal experts from different disciplines participate in focus 
groups and committees, discussing  
sustainable solutions in engineering, packaging, sustainable agriculture and 
life cycle assessment. Campbell is also a 
member of The Sustainability Consortium. 
The Consortium brings together indepen-
dent scientists, researchers and engineers 
from businesses, NGOs, governments and 
leading academic institutions around the

world in an effort to build a scientific foundation that drives 
innovation and improves consumer product sustainability.
In addition, each year Campbell engages its own employees 
through participation in Earth Day activities at several of our 
facilities. These wide-ranging activities have evolved into 
useful educational opportunities for our employees to learn 
how Campbell and its vendors are reducing their carbon 
footprint, as well as how they can also make a difference 
at work and at home.
Inspections, Compliance and Investment
Campbell’s sustainability policies clearly outline the  
expectation that our plants and facilities around the world 
operate in accordance with environmental laws and our 
own high-performance expectations. Although we strive 
for 100 percent compliance every day, we are transparent 
in areas where improvements are needed. Campbell’s reg-
ulatory enforcement activities for FY2013 are summarized in the following table:
FY2013 Regulatory Enforcement Activities
Location/Unit Description Fine Corrective Action
Bolthouse Farms Municipal wastewater permit issues $800,000 Timely filed application for permit consistent

nities by employing multiple resources — including water 
treatment systems, wastewater treatment systems and air 
emission controls. Each year, we invest significant capital 
to maintain and improve these operations. Sustainability 
investments across Campbell’s plant network have yielded savings of more than $50 million since 2009. In FY2013, 
Campbell’s capital investment in environmental compliance 
and sustainability exceeded $16 million.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  107Focused on a Smaller Carbon Footprint
As a business with a value chain that 
begins on the farm, we are acutely aware 
of the potential risks to the food system 
posed by climate change. Weather pattern 
changes over time can have a direct impact 
on many of our agricultural producers, 
which, in turn, could significantly impact 
agricultural inputs to our product portfolio. Our climate strategy is integrated with 
our overall sustainable business strategy 
and encompasses sustainable agriculture, 
procurement, supplier engagement and 
performance reporting. This strategy also includes reductions in our own 
carbon footprint.
This year, we continued to make significant 
progress toward our environmental goals. 
Since 2008, actual cumulative GHG 
emissions have been reduced by 418,869 
tonnes, and our annual emissions have 
been reduced by 14.5 percent. According to the EPA, this is equivalent to the elec-
tricity use of 57,632 homes for one year, 
or removing 87,264 cars from the road. 
In the process, we lowered our energy 
use and are now sourcing 8 percent of 
our global electric power with renewable 
energy sources. This progress has been 
achieved through a wide variety of capital 
investments in energy conservation, as well as our partnership program to develop and 
construct renewable energy projects — 
progress that continued in 2013.

Continued Progress in 2013
An extensive re-lighting project at our processing plant in 
Dixon, California, is a good example of the energy conser-
vation investments Campbell continues to make. A third 
party conducted an audit in advance of upgrading exterior 
lighting to improve quality, increase safety and save energy 
costs. This led to the replacement of more than 1,800 halide 
lighting fixtures with more efficient LED wall packs, flood 
and pole lighting. The project is expected to save 180,088 
kilowatt hours annually and remove 270,000 pounds of 
carbon dioxide, 450 grams of sulfur dioxide and 1 million 
grams of nitrogen oxide from the air. EPA estimates put 
this reduction at the equivalent of the carbon that would 
be sequestered by 104 acres of U.S. forests in one year — 
saving 14,245 gallons of gasoline or removing 26 cars from 
the road. Campbell engineers are also driving an enterprise-wide emissions reduction project to phase out and replace 
refrigeration systems at our bakeries in the U.S. and Australia. 
Several of these systems use hydrochlorofluorocarbons 
(HCFC) and derivative chemical refrigerants, which have 
been shown to be a major source of GHG emissions. We are 
committed to replacing these systems with new technology, 
using non-HCFC refrigerants. Use of these new refrigerants is encouraged in a resolution from the Consumer Goods 
Forum, for which our President and CEO Denise Morrison 
serves as Vice Chair. Through FY2013, we have replaced 
three of nine systems with natural refrigerant technologies 
and expect to complete the project by 2018.
A Growing Renewable Energy Presence
During the past two years, we have worked through the initial 
phase of several renewable energy programs. Solar panel projects have been completed at our operations in Napoleon, 
Ohio; Paris, Texas; and Toronto, Ontario. In addition, an 
anaerobic digester opened in December 2013 at our Napoleon 
plant. This project will divert organic waste from the local 
landfill, while creating a source of renewable electricity for 
the plant. Current agreements on these projects are designed 
to fix the cost of generated electricity for 20 years. 
We also have a working agreement with a development 
company to install several more projects. The agreement 
includes:
• Solar panel systems at five locations;
• Wind turbines at three locations; and
• Two new digester/generator projects.
 
If these projects are implemented, our electricity use sourced 
from renewable sources will increase by approximately 20 to 
25 percent. By the end of FY2015, when we anticipate all these systems will be complete, we expect to be able to source 
32 percent of our global electricity from renewable sources.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  109Conserving a Strategic Resource
Water is a critical component in the  
production of almost all food and bever-
ages. Campbell’s use of water is complex 
and affects every aspect of our production 
and distribution process. We use water to 
rinse vegetables, cook and cool finished 
products, satisfy steam requirements, 
clean and sanitize operations — not to mention its use as a key ingredient in 
our products. Maintaining a clean and 
sustainable supply of water is essential 
both to the future of our Company and 
the future of our local communities.
As part of our 2020 goal to cut the 
environmental footprint of our portfolio 
in half, we are committed to reducing 
operational water use per tonne of food 
produced by 50 percent. Since our 
2008 baseline year, we have realized a 
20.7 percent reduction in operational 
water use through FY2013. In order to sustain this progress, a team of Campbell 
employees and outside experts are eval-
uating the process currently used to 
manufacture products in our most 
water-intensive operations — the facilities 
that manufacture soup, sauce and juice 
products. This effort is expected to result 
in a manufacturing process that is more 
uniform across our network and one that is much more energy- and water-efficient. 
Since 2008, the total cumulative water 
savings has been 4.8 billion gallons.
Water Conservation and Treatment
Campbell manufacturing plants have 
implemented water conservation measures 
and have established systems to ensure 
that the water used in our operations is appropriately cleaned and treated before 
it is returned to the environment. We apply 
a stewardship philosophy when it comes to water by advancing conservation across 
our enterprise and committing to returning 
clean and appropriately treated water to 
our local communities. Process and sani-
tary wastewater is collected, then treated 
by either a Company-owned or municipal- 
owned wastewater treatment plant prior 
to its return to the environment.

Water Scarcity Mapping
Campbell also understands the risk of water scarcity. Each 
year, we perform a site-by-site mapping of water usage and 
cross-reference the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD) Global Water Tool to include near-  
and long-term water scarcity. The WBCSD created the Global Water Tool to help companies map their facility water intake, 
recycled water and wastewater extraction procedures. The 
tool, using close to 30 external datasets from various research 
and creditable sources, analyzes our plant data (geospatial and water records) against the external datasets and provides us with important information on water dependency, water purification/treatment and water risk on a country level, as 
well as water supply and water scarcity per country and 
local watershed levels. 
While we currently account for gross water use metrics, we 
have not fully accounted for our very strong water recycling 
and stewardship practices in the following chart. In coming years, Campbell intends to strengthen the full gross-net 
water management data.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  111Steady and Measurable Waste Reduction
Campbell applies a consistent approach 
to managing the waste generated in our 
office and plant operations. Our waste 
processes are centered on closed-loop 
options and beneficial reuse principles. 
We also employ a hierarchical decision- 
making process for reducing, reusing 
and recycling in our operations to both reduce costs and minimize the impact 
of production on the environment. Our 
2020 goal is to recycle 95 percent or more 
of the waste produced at Campbell’s 
global facilities. 
In FY2013, we generated 221,949 metric 
tonnes of solid waste from our worldwide 
operations. Of this amount, 184,554 
tonnes were recycled, while another 
37,395 were disposed of in local landfills 
or utilized as fuel for resource recovery 
facilities. Campbell’s worldwide recycle 
rate for FY2013 was 83.2 percent. Since 2010, we have reduced our waste per 
tonne of food produced by 53.6 percent.Strategic initiatives have been implemented 
to reduce Campbell’s various waste 
streams. Current programs to recycle 
food waste, corrugated paper, steel 
drums, office paper, plastic, fluorescent 
tubes, batteries, wood pallets and scrap 
metal are constantly being evaluated 
to ensure maximum efficiency. These practices require ongoing employee 
engagement. In order to close the gap 
between current recycling levels and 
our 2020 goal, we anticipate it will be 
necessary to further train and engage employees with respect to sorting and 
management of waste streams.
Part of this effort includes the diversion 
of off-specification product from local 
landfills to a facility that can remove the 
container to reuse the food material as 
ingredients for animal feed. In this case, 
Campbell leverages the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Food Waste Recovery 
Hierarchy to prioritize our food waste

reduction efforts. We also participate on the Leadership 
Committee of a three-year initiative launched by the Grocery 
Manufacturers Association and Food Marketing Institute to 
help our industry reduce levels of food waste. Both of these 
efforts, along with composting or using waste as a source 
of renewable energy, have reduced the amount of waste 
Campbell sends to local landfills.
The Campbell Asset Recovery Team is another important 
asset of our waste reduction program. Maintaining an online marketplace and using data-tracking tools to help facilitate 
their efforts, this team works globally to find beneficial reuse 
or recycling options for some of the food-processing and 
electronic equipment we no longer use or need. In FY2013, 
the Campbell team recycled or reused almost 1.42 million 
pounds of used equipment and generated nearly $1.6 million 
in revenue from the sale of used equipment. In addition, we 
scrapped or recycled almost 195,000 pounds of equipment 
and donated used items from our Camden headquarters totaling 20,300 pounds.Waste as Renewable Energy
As part of our renewable energy program, Campbell is  
beginning to implement waste-to-energy anaerobic  
digesters. Digesters provide a source of renewable energy, and also help improve our solid-waste recycling rate, reduce 
waste disposal costs and serve as a regional waste man-
agement solution. The first system, which is located at our 
Napoleon, Ohio, facility, will eliminate the current practice 
of disposing organic food waste in a local landfill, and will 
greatly improve our ability to dispose of the organic solids 
generated from our wastewater treatment system, also at 
the Napoleon site.

OPPORTUNITIES  |  113Big Improvements in Smaller Packages
Campbell’s global packaging development 
organization is committed to continuously 
improving our sustainable packaging 
footprint. Our packaging professionals are 
engaged in both short-term improvements 
and long-term innovation that reduces the 
environmental impact of our products. 
To support these efforts, we established a global packaging sustainability program 
with publicly stated goals and established 
guidelines and principles, which are 
integrated into packaging development 
on a continuous basis. We have also developed training for our packaging 
designers so that they understand the 
Company’s expectations and direction. 
This enables them to include sustainability 
implications in the analysis whenever a 
packaging change is contemplated.
Our Packaging Principles & Goals
Campbell’s packaging is designed with  a sustainability mindset, delivering safe, 
consumer-preferred packaging that 
minimizes our environmental impact. 
We create economic value by linking 
sustainability with source reduction, 
material selection and supply chain 
efficiencies. In addition, we partner with 
our suppliers, customers and industry 
groups to strengthen our sustainable packaging program and influence 
industry trends.Campbell has developed three 2020 
packaging goals that guide our sustain-
ability efforts. First, we will eliminate 
100 million pounds of packaging through 
both material selection and material 
reduction. Second, we want to source 
100 percent of our packaging from sus -
tainable materials, including renewable 
and recyclable materials and packaging 
made from recycled content. Finally, we 
aspire to have 100 percent of our pack -
aging supply base proactively engaged in developing sustainable alternatives that are economically feasible, grounded 
in science and technology, and have 
sustainable end-of-life scenarios. 
To help us attain these 2020 packaging 
goals, Campbell follows five packaging 
principles that drive innovation:
• Protect: Implement packaging that delivers the safest, highest-quality food, while ensuring consumer and 
brand protection.
• Reduce: Continuously use packaging material and processes that utilize 
fewer resources while maintaining 
product quality and supply chain 
efficiency.
• Recycle: Utilize recyclable and  recycled content in packaging materials whenever possible.
• Renew: Use renewable resources in packaging materials whenever safe 
and effective.
• Partner: Work with suppliers to  
promote clean production technolo-
gies and best manufacturing practices.

In FY2013, we reduced our use of packaging materials by 
more than 4.2 million pounds. In the Asia-Pacific region alone, 
Campbell replaced glass packaging for several products with 
ultra-lightweight PET plastic, resulting in the elimination of 
more than 3.5 million pounds of packaging. As a cumulative 
total, Campbell has eliminated more than 65 million pounds 
of packaging materials since FY2009 — or about 65.2 percent 
of our 2020 destination goal.
 
Looking ahead to FY2014, Campbell is investigating the use of lightweight glass, a move that could eliminate up to an 
additional 8 million pounds. We are also looking at ways to 
use lightweight shrink film and aluminum cans in our pack -
aging, as well as reducing our use of corrugated materials.

2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Can sustainability make a  
difference in people’s lives?  
It certainly has for Niki Kelley 
King, Campbell’s Manager  of the Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) Program 
Office. Niki joined Campbell  
in 2008 as a Senior Paralegal, 
but found her passion in CSR.
“About a year into my paralegal 
career at Campbell, I began helping Dave Stangis, our Vice 
President of Public Affairs and Corporate Responsibility, with the CSR Report and quickly fell in love with the work,” 
says Niki. “Dave has been a great mentor, and this 2014 
report is the fifth I’ve worked on.” 
It’s a lengthy project that requires a lot of effort and deter-
mination, as well as the support of many people across the enterprise. Part of the challenge of CSR reporting, Niki finds, 
is “personalizing” the content to the goals and values of 
Campbell as an organization. “There are hundreds of defi-nitions for CSR out there, but Campbell chose to define CSR 
in a way that included all of our employees and fit our values,” 
explains Niki. “We wanted to make sure that CSR and sustain-ability were fully integrated into all aspects of our business.”
Niki uses several best practices when pulling together our 
CSR report. First, the Campbell report uses a recognized 
reporting framework — in this case, the voluntary guidelines 
laid out by the Global Reporting Initiative. She’s also invested time to clearly identify our target audience, which includes 
not just our employees and investors, but other stakeholders, 
such as nongovernmental organizations. Knowing with whom Campbell must communicate helps identify material issues 
and also suggests ways our CSR report can become a commu-
nication piece that goes beyond discussions of sustainability.
The content is intended to engage readers through story -
telling and visual elements that report our progress against 
goals in a multiyear format. We also want the report’s look and 
feel to be complementary to Campbell’s other communication 
platforms, and have structured the material so that it can be leveraged for additional communication opportunities 
throughout the year.Above all, however, the material being communicated must 
be transparent — a critical element in building a comprehen-
sive CSR report. Niki has worked hard with key managers 
and leaders at Campbell to emphasize the importance of reporting transparency. “It’s all about building trust in your 
company’s leaders, developing these relationships and helping 
them understand the critical importance of transparency to the CSR process,” she says.
For each annual CSR update, Niki and her team begin the 
process with research and benchmarking activities. Not only 
is it important to take a critical look at Campbell’s most 
recent report, but also to compare it to what competitors and other Fortune 500 companies are doing in their reports. 
“CSR reporting is an evolving practice,” she notes. “A lot of 
time is spent evaluating changes to reporting guidelines, what peer companies are doing and identifying any gaps 
that may exist in Campbell’s own process.”
The next step is to define what will be that report’s content 
and then gather the data — a process driven in part by 
subject-matter experts across the business. Defining the content is a year-round process that includes engaging 
with many of our stakeholders — employees, investors, 
customers and others — to identify what really matters  
to them. “These stakeholders are a key element in our 
reporting,” says Niki. “They really inform what goes into 
our CSR report.” 
Once the content is identified and the data gathered, the 
report is designed and written. Each draft is put through a variety of reviews, including ones conducted by our legal 
and various subject-matter experts. With a final version in 
hand, the report is published online and Campbell starts the process of communicating and sharing the report with 
our stakeholders.
Although the reporting process has lots of moving parts, 
we have worked hard to continuously improve the quality 
of our CSR reports. It’s an ongoing process that requires a lot of persistence, but “I have found something that I love 
doing and that I believe in,” remarks Niki, who will receive her 
Master’s in Business Management in 2014 — with the help of the Campbell tuition assistance plan. “There are challenges 
such as gathering data, incorporating new businesses into the 
reporting and obtaining buy-in from business unit leaders, but I love a challenge and that is why this is a great fit for me.”

2014 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
REPORTING  |  117This is Campbell Soup Company’s annual 
Corporate Social Responsibility Report. In 
this report, we strive to provide our stake-
holders with a balanced view of our CSR and sustainability strategy and performance in 
our worldwide operations during fiscal year 
2013 (ended July 31, 2013). This report includes an update to key programs and 
performance metrics as well as progress 
against our 2020 goals. Our previous report was published in 2013. Significant policy or 
program advances and recognition occurring 
after FY2013 may also be included.
We prepared this report using the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, along with the GRI Food 
Processing Sector Supplement. We have self- 
declared this CSR Report to a GRI Application Level of “B,” based on the GRI Application 
Level grid. A GRI Content Index is provided 
here. Our intent is to begin transitioning to the GRI 4.0 framework in next year’s update 
of this report, with the expectation that we 
will be in full compliance with GRI 4.0 by 2015.
This Campbell CSR Report addresses our 
operations on a global basis. Unless other-wise stated, principles and policies referenced 
in the report apply to Company-owned 
locations worldwide, and to all employees of Campbell Soup Company. Bolthouse Farms 
was acquired at the beginning of FY2013 and 
data for Bolthouse Farms operations has been incorporated on a limited basis where noted. 
Plum Organics was acquired in June 2013, and 
Campbell worked with Plum to incorporate it as a Public Benefit Corporation (Plum, PBC) 
under Delaware law. Kelsen was acquired in 
August 2013. Some of their initiatives are also included where appropriate.
The metrics and goals in this report are 
established and measured by the Campbell 
business units and corporate functions that are 
responsible for achieving them. This is done in consultation with internal and, in some cases, external stakeholders, as well as by reference 
to external benchmarks and leadership 
practices. Our goal is to deliver a useful and accurate picture of our performance.
Data collection in a multinational manufac-
turing company is complex, and there are 
meaningful challenges to compiling consistent 
performance metrics across numerous plant and facility sites in multiple countries. While 
this report includes globally consistent metrics 
in most areas, we continue to work on improv -
ing the standardization of our measurement 
systems and building baselines in other areas, 
such as nutrition and agriculture. Performance metrics cover Campbell-owned and -operated 
facilities. Environmental metrics are reported 
using widely accepted parameters and units. We use the Carbon Disclosure Project 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol to calculate our 
GHG emissions. Nutrition metrics are fully described with footnotes and references. 
Financial data is presented in U.S. dollars. 
Campbell management uses a system of internal controls, including a process of 
verification by internal subject-matter experts, 
to ensure that this report fairly represents our CSR and environmental sustainability 
activities and results.
