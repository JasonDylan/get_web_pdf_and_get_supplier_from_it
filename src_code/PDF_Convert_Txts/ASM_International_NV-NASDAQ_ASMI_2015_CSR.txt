innovationTRANSPARENCY
CONNECTIVITYWe are passionate about making scientific breakthroughs but we don’t believe in 
innovation simply for the sake of innovation. We believe new discoveries are only 
truly valuable if they make a difference to people's lives and society as a whole.
WE’RE CREATING VALUE 
FOR EVERYONE
We provide leading-edge technologies that enable 
electronic devices to deliver superior performance 
while reducing their energy consumption. Adding 
more processing power to smaller and smaller 
devices means our customers can expand the use 
of smart technology into products that help improve 
the quality of life of people everywhere.
Corporate responsibility is an integral part of our 
strategy. What it means in practice is that we are 
committed to creating added value for all our 
stakeholders while meeting our responsibilities 
towards the environment and society. We set high 
goals for ourselves. We want to be a leader in corporate responsibility, 
not only in our industry, but across all industries. 
In our journey towards integrated reporting, our value 
creation story plays an essential role. We want to 
connect the dots between our vision, strategy and 
long-term value creation in the context of our external 
environment. In this year’s report, we’ve highlighted 
six key themes showing how we believe what we do 
helps  create a better future for everyone. 
For more information on these themes, and our 
corporate strategy, we’ve included references in this 
report to relevant sections in our Statutory annual 
report  and our corporate website .

We are in constant touch with our stakeholders 
so we can understand their needs more fully 
and precisely. By remaining transparent when 
we communicate, we encourage open, honest 
dialogue, which creates greater respect, 
stronger connections and better collaboration. 
Above all, it builds relationships based on trust.
But it’s not just about what our stakeholders 
say, it’s also about what we do. Actions speak 
louder than words. We take pride in seeing 
our commitments through – whether that’s a promise to an internal colleague, an external 
customer or another key stakeholder.
We believe strongly in the fact that this enables 
us to create mutually beneficial relationships 
with our stakeholders. These close relationships 
are the basis for developing groundbreaking 
innovations and technologies that enable people 
across the world to explore their own potential. “ WE DO

ASMI CORPORATE RESPOSIBILITY REPORT 2015 | ABOUT USREPORT PRIORITIZE IDENTIFY1 2 3IMPROVING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
In 2015 we formalized how we will engage with our 
stakeholders and worked on improving our dialogue 
with them by conducting a stakeholder priority 
assessment. We also carried out market research and 
benchmarking to identify industry trends. The results 
generated opportunities for us to establish a better fit 
between what matters most to our stakeholders and 
our business strategies. Going forward, our goal is 
to make sure we have ways of identifying stakeholder 
concerns and priorities early and often so that they 
can feed in to the design of our future non-financial 
strategies and performance measurement. 
 
MATERIALITY 
Our approach to responsible management involves 
identifying and prioritizing the aspects that matter 
most to our business. These include any issues 
that involve the potential for significant risk or 
opportunity and any issues that are critical to our 
key stakeholders. 
THE GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE
In 2015 we used the sustainability materiality 
steps and matrix based on the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting 
Framework. We identified the environmental, social 
and economic material aspects which have the 
greatest impact on our business and generated the 
greatest level of interest among stakeholders within 
our value chain. These direct and indirect aspects 
may represent opportunities and risks, influencing 
how we develop our non-financial strategies. 
Assessing these aspects enables us to establish 
priorities, and then focus upon the ones that matter 
most. We can then measure and understand their 
implications in financial and non-financial terms while 
addressing them through our policies and programs. 
ASSESSING OUR STAKEHOLDERS
Our materiality assessment was also informed 
by our ongoing market research, trend analysis, 
and stakeholder input and prioritization. In 2015 
we conducted an assessment of our stakeholders 
to find out what mattered most to them. The 
assessment took into account both the impact 
on our business and the level of concern coming 
from multiple stakeholders. You can see the results 
in the materiality matrix, on  page 21 .

MANAGING STAKEHOLDER 
EXPECTATIONS
Customers, shareholders and other stakeholders 
expect more of us each year. The bar keeps getting 
higher. We strive to meet these ever-increasing 
expectations by aligning the way we manage ASMI 
with international and industry standards such as 
the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) 
Code of Conduct regarding environmental, health and 
safety, labor, ethics and management systems, and 
the UN Global Compact Principles regarding human 
rights and labor issues.
THE BENEFITS OF STAKEHOLDER 
ENGAGEMENT
We engage directly with our stakeholders so 
we can understand their expectations better 
and respond to them more effectively. We value stakeholder engagements as a way of identifying 
external developments and trends that may impact 
our business and strategy – in good ways or bad. 
This feedback helps to shape the way we manage 
our response to these issues across all corporate 
responsibility areas. Ultimately, it makes us stronger.
CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
OUR CUSTOMERS
We engage with customers as a way to meet 
their expectations more precisely and improve our 
CR programs. We regularly report our efforts and 
progress to our customers, and in turn they regularly 
evaluate us on our performance in all areas of 
corporate responsibility. In 2015 we conducted 
a customer satisfaction survey that covered many 
aspects of our interactions with our customers 
including key aspects of corporate responsibility. 
SUPPLY CHAIN SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT CR POLICY AND OBJECTIVES21INTEGRATED CR STRATEGY
ASMI CORPORATE RESPOSIBILITY REPORT 2015 | ABOUT USThe results validated actions taken by us in response 
to what we had learned from previous surveys and 
suggested areas where we can further improve. 
HOW CUSTOMERS ASSESS US
As well as evaluating our corporate responsibility 
programs, our customers also conduct in-depth 
assessments of our organization, take part in process 
evaluations and assess our performance. The close 
relationships we have with our customers helps them 
to better understand ASMI processes, objectives and 
performance in key business areas and ensure that we 
can meet more than just their product expectations.
TRUSTED PARTNER FOR CUSTOMERS 
THROUGH EICC COMPLIANCE
We know that our customers want to do business 
with companies that are managed ethically and 
responsibly. They actively encourage us to put in 
place the right management processes for corporate 
responsibility and to plan for the long-term following 
the right objectives and goals. At the same time, 
we want to be a trusted partner for our customers 
and the communities in which we operate. Trust is 
the basis for all responsible business.
As part of the semiconductor industry value chain, 
many of our customers are Electronic Industry 
Citizenship Coalition (EICC) members. Many of the 
material issues that impact our business and are 
priorities to our stakeholders, such as worker health 
and safety, labor and human rights, environmental 
standards and ethics, are embedded in the EICC 
Code of Conduct. 
ADOPTING THE EICC CODE
We have adopted the EICC Code both for our 
operations and for our suppliers, by making it 
our Supplier Code of Conduct for supply chain risk 
assessment and management. By integrating this 
industry standard and its risk assessment tools, 
templates and auditing standards with our existing 
processes and management system, we will be 
better able to establish the right framework and 
metrics to measure and report our corporate 
responsibility progress. This, in turn, will meet 
what our stakeholders expect from us. 
COMPLYING WITH THE EICC CODE
The EICC Code of Conduct sets out a structure 
for conducting our business responsibly in the 
areas of the environment, health and safety, labor, ethics and our supply chain. The Code is updated 
periodically, and we are committed to upgrading 
our management practices as the code evolves. 
Our corporate responsibility policy and management 
system helps us to manage compliance with the 
Code. For example, our global EICC Committee 
met regularly in 2015 to ensure we were driving 
the right programs, system and culture of EICC 
and corporate responsibility compliance. But that’s 
not all – every one of our employees is responsible 
for adhering to the Code of Conduct. 
RISK ASSESSMENTS AND THIRD PARTY 
EICC AUDITS
Our risk assessment involves using the industry 
standard EICC self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ). 
The results that we get from the assessments drive 
our own internal programs for improvement. We also 
share the results with multiple customers as part of 
their Supply Chain risk assessments. At the end of 
2015, all our sites continued to be rated ‘low risk’ 
both using the EICC management system and risk 
assessment tool and by the customers that engage 
with us in their supply chain assessments. In addition, 
in 2015 we had an independent third party conduct 
EICC audits of our operations and facilities. This is 
a continuation of our existing commitment and plan 
to periodically complete such audits across all areas 
of our operations. The audit results supported our 
belief that we have strong programs in place that 
ensure compliance to the EICC Code of Conduct. 
There were also some observations made for 
improvement which matched our own existing 
assessment of our progress.

ASMI CORPORATE RESPOSIBILITY REPORT 2015 | ABOUT USSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS
The EICC Code of Conduct also establishes standards 
to ensure that working conditions in the electronics 
industry supply chain are safe, that workers are treated 
with respect and dignity, and that business operations 
are environmentally responsible and conducted 
ethically. The code provides a credible process for 
evaluating and managing supply chains from the point 
of view of labor, ethics, environmental and sourcing.
TAX PRINCIPLE
We believe that tax should follow the business. Hence 
income is reported in the countries where value is 
created. We do not use artificial tax structures solely 
aimed at tax avoidance. Taxes are determined and paid 
in accordance with all relevant rules and regulations in 
the countries in which ASMI operates. ASMI aims to 
follow both the letter as well as the spirit of the law.
ASMI applies the “at arm’s length” principle to 
determine transfer prices in accordance with domestic 
and international rules and standards, such as the 
OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development) guidelines for Multinational Companies.
Our disclosures are made in accordance with the 
relevant local and or international regulations.
ASMI seeks an open and constructive dialog with the 
tax authorities in the countries where we operate. Our 
aim is to disclose all relevant facts and circumstances. 
We believe that this will enhance certainty on our 
respective tax position in view of the applicable tax 
rules and regulations.
GOVERNANCE, RISK MANAGEMENT 
AND STRATEGY
OUR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
GOVERNANCE
At ASMI, we are committed to upholding the high 
standards expected by our stakeholders for corporate 
governance and ethics practices. We believe the best 
way to meet the interests of our shareholders, 
customers and employees is by instilling a culture 
of responsibility in everything we do, and then 
supporting that culture with comprehensive policies 
and procedures. We have embedded all aspects of 
corporate responsibility in our management system. 
It starts with the Supervisory and Management 
Boards and the corporate governance standards 
they hold the company accountable to, and it involves everyone working for ASMI. Details of our current 
corporate governance commitment, standards and 
practices can always be found on our website .
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, SAFETY , 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND HUMAN 
RESOURCES
Our Management Board is actively engaged in 
corporate responsibility through the Vice President 
of Human Resources and the Vice President of 
Operational Excellence, who is directly responsible 
for the Environmental, Health, Safety and Corporate 
Responsibility organization. 
Working together, these two organizations have 
key roles in the identification and creation of policy, 
managing our approach to key aspects of corporate 
responsibility and evaluating the results. These include 
aspects of environmental performance, employee 
health and safety, labor and ethics. But corporate 
responsibility is not limited to just these aspects. 
For example, Trade Compliance and Finance are 
addressed strategically and operationally within 
the relevant internal organizations. 
ETHICS COMMITTEE AND EICC COMMITTEE
There are two committees that help us to develop 
policy and manage our approach to these key 
aspects of corporate responsibility. Both committees 
are comprised of cross-functional members 
representing different but related aspects of the 
business. The committees are:
 ›Ethics Committee – Chairperson, 
VP of Human Resources;
 ›EICC Committee – Chairperson, Director Global 
Environmental, Health and Safety/Corporate 
Responsibility (reporting to the VP of Operational 
Excellence).

RESPONSIBILITY STRATEGY
There are many risks that could have an impact 
on our business. To manage these risks, we have 
established a culture of openness and transparency 
across ASMI. We proactively identify risks, and 
then manage and control them within our risk 
management and control framework. You can find 
out more about our risk management and control 
framework in our Statutory annual report .
Our materiality assessment helps to identify the 
strategic, operational, financial and compliance 
risks facing our current business and affecting 
future growth opportunities. We review the results 
of the assessment and take this into consideration 
when we set our corporate responsibility strategies. 
The following key strategic, operational, financial and 
compliance risk and material concerns and strategies 
were identified in the materiality assessment.
Technology and innovation
The semiconductor and the semiconductor 
equipment industries face rapid change towards more 
complex and leading-edge technologies. Our ability to 
keep investing in R&D and innovation, and to respond 
rapidly to new product and technology requirements 
is critical to our business success. To help us to keep 
innovating, our strategy is to continue to invest and 
partner with top universities and research institutions. 
You can read more details in ‘Investment and 
Partnership for Innovation’ on  page 37  of this report. 
Talent and human resources
Our business and future business success relies 
on our employees. That means we need to keep 
attracting, developing, and retaining highly-qualified 
talented people in a very competitive market. For this 
reason, we consider talent management a strategic 
focus for ASMI. You can read more in ‘Social’ on

In striving for our vision of ZERO HARM!  to people and the planet, we focus on 
health and safety, the environment, labor, ethics and supply chain management. 
Our commitment to sustainability begins at the product development requirements 
phase and runs through our entire product life cycle. In 2016 we will further 
improve in the areas of EICC compliance, our environmental objectives, 
sustainability in the product life cycle, and succession planning and talent review.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

SUPPLY CHAIN SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT INTEGRATED CR STRATEGY ABOUT US26CR POLICY AND OBJECTIVES
ASMI CORPORATE RESPOSIBILITY REPORT 2015 |Corporate responsibility policyINTEGRATION WITH OUR 
PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE 
In our product life cycle, we consider sustainability 
starting from the product development requirements 
phase. Product sustainability includes requirements 
such as product safety to workers and customers, 
how efficient our chemical consumption is, how 
efficient we are at utilizing our facilities, greenhouse 
gas emission efficiency during the production 
phase, and how we manage the ‘end of life’ 
of our products. The way we govern our product 
life cycle management process ensures that we 
track performance against these requirements 
at the design, validation and production phases. 
RECENT EXAMPLES OF PRODUCT 
SUSTAINABILITY
In a 2015 product beta release, the product 
development team demonstrated that they had 
reduced precursor chemical consumption by 
more than 1.3 times the industry benchmark. 
This breakthrough will not only lead to reduced cost 
of ownership for customers, but will also reduce the 
amount of process chemicals required and effluent 
produced. Similarly, product safety assessments 
carried out at several product maturity levels ensure 
our products are safe to operate and maintain at our 
ASM locations and at our customer locations. In 
2015 we also increased our refurbishment business 
so that equipment reaching its ‘end of life’ could be 
refurbished and put back in the marketplace. This 
reduced the amount of equipment our customers 
had to dispose of while helping them improve their 
recycling and reuse efforts.OUR OBJECTIVES FOR 2016
In 2016 we will make further progress towards 
globalizing and unifying our responsible business 
practices. This will help ensure greater cohesion and 
effectiveness. Specifically, we will focus on our ability 
to manage and measure performance relating to:
 ›EICC compliance in our supply chain;
 ›updating and expanding our environmental 
objectives with a new five-year plan;
 ›improve our focus on sustainability during 
the product life cycle; 
 ›focus on succession planning and talent review.
SUPPLY CHAIN SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT INTEGRATED CR STRATEGY ABOUT US27CR POLICY AND OBJECTIVES
ASMI CORPORATE RESPOSIBILITY REPORT 2015 |ENVIRONMENT
We manage our consumption of resources, our product environmental footprint, 
and our enabling technologies responsibly. We are certified to the ISO 14001 
standard for our Environmental Management System and we participate 
in the Carbon Disclosure Project. We continue to reduce our greenhouse gas 
emissions, water consumption and the amount of waste we send to landfill. 
And our 'Good Catch' initiative enables employees to help us improve our 
environmental management system and performance.
OUR APPROACH
Our approach to environmental stewardship starts 
with our philosophy of ZERO HARM! . We believe 
that we can make the world a better place through 
responsibly managing our energy and water 
consumption, our product environmental footprint, 
and our enabling technologies.
MANAGING ENERGY RESPONSIBLY
Our research and development is at the cutting edge 
of driving down energy demands for computing 
power by increasing the number of calculations 
per kilowatt hour. As we help our customers 
reduce transistor size, through our research and 
development and the equipment we manufacture, 
we are supporting greater energy efficiency that can 
be realized in a wide range of different applications 
throughout the world by everyone.
ISO 14001 STANDARD
But our technology is just one way we can achieve 
ZERO HARM! . We also strive to reduce our own 
environmental footprint. We are certified to 
the ISO 14001 standard for our Environmental 
Management System and, in 2015, we successfully 
maintained that certification following annual 
third-party assessments and audits. ‘GOOD CATCH’
We don’t just rely on our accreditation, we actively 
ensure everyone commits to responsible environmental 
management through our global and site committees, 
dedicated environmental professionals at our sites, 
and a robust reporting and suggestion system we call 
‘Good Catch’. ‘Good Catch’ enables our employees 
to report a suggestion for improvement for any aspect 
of our environmental management, confident in the 
knowledge that their suggestion will be reviewed by our 
global Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) team. 
KEY FOCUS AREAS
In 2013 we established a three-year environmental 
performance targets cycle. We based it on four 
key areas that are consistent with environmental 
measures for the semiconductor industry. They 
are: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water 
consumption, recycled solid waste and unplanned 
discharges. In 2015 we concluded our three-year 
cycle and achieved two out of four goals – we 
exceeded our water consumption reduction goal and 
had zero discharge violations. We also came very 
close to achieving our GHG goal, but fell short of our 
recycling goal.
SUPPLY CHAIN SOCIAL CR POLICY AND OBJECTIVES INTEGRATED CR STRATEGY ABOUT US28ENVIRONMENT
ASMI CORPORATE RESPOSIBILITY REPORT 2015 |ENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENTAL TARGETS FOR 2016-2020
In 2015 we conducted market research and industry 
benchmarking, and set new environmental targets 
for 2016-2020. They are:
 ›to further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions 
by 5% per euro of R&D spend below 2015 levels 
by 2020.
 ›to reduce water use by 10% per euro of R&D spend 
below 2015 levels by 2020.
 ›to identify product packaging reuse and recycling 
opportunities so that we can send less than 10% 
of all waste to landfill by 2020.
 ›to have all new construction projects exceed the 
energy efficiency standards of local jurisdictions. 
In 2016 we also will quantify Scope 3 greenhouse 
gas emissions with key logistic suppliers for product-
related transportation emissions and further identify 
reduction targets to pursue by 2020. 
CHALLENGES, OPPORTUNITIES 
AND MANAGING RISK
Over the last three years, we have made significant 
progress towards our environmental targets. This 
progress has been made in the face of challenges such 
as rapid business growth in Asia, globalization of our 
manufacturing operations, and with a manufacturing 
transition to outsourcing. Growth in Asia was driven 
by increased new product development, which 
required multiple product and infrastructure 
installations at our engineering sites. These additional 
equipment installations meant increased energy 
consumption, which we had to offset with further 
reduction projects. 
MANAGING OUR GREENHOUSE 
GAS EMISSIONS
We track and manage our GHG emissions and we 
have participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project 
(CDP) for the past three calendar years. We do not 
anticipate that global climate change will present 
a significant physical risk to our current product 
development and manufacturing operations based 
at our locations in the US, Japan, South Korea, 
the Netherlands and Singapore. However, we 
recognize our role in society and our stakeholders’ 
desire for us to be a responsible corporate citizen, 
so we constantly identify opportunities to reduce our 
energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Our approach to managing climate change risks is 
to set strategies, objectives and internal reporting 
goals under our Environmental Management 
Systems (EMS). 
ROUTINE REVIEWS OF 
ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS
All of the following ASM sites – Almere, Netherlands, 
Phoenix, United States, Tokyo, Japan, Singapore, 
and Cheonan, South Korea – are certified to 
the ISO 14001 standard for their Environmental 
Management System (EMS). Under this system, 
structured programs are put in place to routinely 
conduct significant environmental aspects and impact 
assessments. Reviews are conducted at least on 
an annual basis and during significant business and 
operational changes. These ‘aspects and impacts’ 
are taken into consideration when we set global and 
regional environmental targets and objectives. 
MANAGING RISKS
The environmental risks identified are aligned with 
specific operations and aspects at each site so 
that we can put in place a focused strategy and 
improvement programs. Once the environmental 
risks are identified in each region and site, our local 
senior management is engaged in a comprehensive 
review of the aspects and impacts before setting 
targets and priorities for the improvement programs. 
At a regional level and at site level, we prioritize risks 
and opportunities taking into account factors such 
as the contribution to ASMI’s global environmental 
performance, fiscal planning, future business impact 
assessments, and resource allocation for success.
ANTICIPATING FUTURE CHANGES 
IN LEGISLATION
We don’t currently see any pending regulatory 
changes in the regions and countries in which we 
operate that pose significant risks to our operations 
or ability to manage our environmental performance. 
We do see potential challenges in possible future 
changes to the Restriction of Hazardous Substances 
Directive (RoHS) as adopted by the European 
Union. Currently, ASMI products are excluded 
from applicability under Article 2.4(d), but there is 
a potential this could change in the near future. 
We are already planning for this possible change 
through RoHS-compliant article declarations from 
our suppliers, and integrating and improving controls 
within our Product Life Cycle (PLC).

In 2015 we surpassed our water consumption

environment. We fell slightly short of our goal to 
implement sustainable greenhouse gas reduction 
projects, achieving 95% of our targeted goal, and 
we achieved 65% recycling diversion away from 
landfill against our target of 85%.
REDUCTION IN WATER CONSUMPTION 
IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA
Our performance was strong in meeting the water 
goal due to focused improvements in air emission 
control equipment at our Phoenix, Arizona site. These 
efforts reduced water consumption in 2015 by 11% 
from 2014 levels and by over 12% since we set the 
baseline in 2012, significantly surpassing our 5% 
reduction goal. 
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
In 2013 we established a three-year greenhouse 
gas (GHG) reduction target of 5% or more from 
existing operations against a 2012 baseline. By 2015, 
at the end of the 3-year cycle, we accomplished the 
implementation of sustainable reductions equaling 
4.74% or 95% of our goal. At the same time, our absolute level of GHG emissions increased 2.7% 
during that period. This was because we increased 
electrical consumption and the resulting Scope 2 
emissions as a result of new equipment installation 
in support of product development, engineering 
and R&D. The new equipment consumes more 
electricity, and our electrical consumption accounts 
for approximately 99% of our combined Scope 
1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. We are looking 
carefully at this area for opportunities to improve 
our performance.

Recycling solid waste ended the three-year goal cycle 
at a 65% diversion from landfill rate – short of our 
goal of an 85% landfill diversion rate. Some regions 
continue to be constrained by lack of available 
recycling capabilities. We are working closely with 
a recycling vendor that did not maximize separation 
of combined waste to an acceptable level to 
encourage them to increase their efficiency.
PERMIT COMPLIANCE
In 2015 we did not violate any environmental permits 
or authorizations due to unintended discharges.

OBSERVING EARTH HOUR IN SINGAPORE
We are committed to minimizing our environmental 
impact across our operations, globally, with our 
ZERO HARM!  philosophy. As part of our overall energy 
saving and environmental awareness efforts, employees 
at the ASM Singapore site organized an energy and 
environmental conservation initiative in coordination with 
Earth Hour on March 28, 2015. Earth Hour was developed 
by the World Wildlife Fund to create a global program 
that unites millions of people to show their concern for 
the environment by turning off their lights for an hour in 
a collective display of their commitment to create a better 
future for the planet. ASM Singapore employees have 
been supporting this global initiative for three years.

ASMI CORPORATE RESPOSIBILITY REPORT 2015 |SOCIAL
The greatest contribution to society that we make as a company is innovation. 
Our people are the differentiating factor that truly drives innovation forward 
in our industry. Driving our industry forward requires not only a strong focus on 
health and safety, but also a culture of ethical behavior while respecting labor 
and diversity. We have a strong focus on our people practices to attract, enable 
and engage employees and help them excel. We expand and deepen our focus 
on innovation through strategic partnerships. And our employees are committed 
to helping society through charity and community initiatives.
OUR APPROACH
In 2015 we continued our investment in Research 
and Development (R&D) totaling €93.0 million. 
These investments are not only good for business, 
they help create innovations that bring about greater 
opportunities for people, families and society. At the 
end of 2015, 26% of our staff were employed in 
R&D. This is an increase of 15% compared to the 
end of 2014. Our approach is to continue to seek 
out and employ the top minds in our field and to lead 
through innovation, both for our company growth 
and prosperity, and for society as a whole. For further 
information on our research and development, please 
refer to our Statutory annual report . 
ETHICS
At ASMI, our Code of Ethics applies to our Supervisory 
and Management Boards, our Management Team, 
and to all our employees, worldwide. The Code is 
designed to promote honest and ethical conduct, 
as well as timely and accurate disclosure in 
our reporting.
BUILDING A CULTURE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR
The true ethics of our company are found not only 
in our corporate commitments and policy statements, but in how our people behave every day. We are 
committed to build, and maintain an ethical culture 
that includes our entire workforce and our supply 
chain. All new employees are required to take ethics 
training. After their initial training, we require all our 
employees to take refresher training every two years. 
IMPROVING OUR SYSTEM OF ETHICS
Under the governance of our Ethics Committee, 
which reports to the Management Board, we 
continually track our performance against our goals 
and improve our ethics management system and 
performance. In 2015 the Ethics Committee made 
the following changes to our system of ethics:
Value of zero ethics issues 
The committee decided that absolute targets were 
not aligned with our value of having zero ethics 
issues. Instead they decided the focus should be 
on providing awareness and the ability to maintain 
confidentiality through anonymous reporting to 
ensure employees and suppliers alike feel protected 
if they make a report. Through our anonymous 
global reporting program, SpeakUp!, our employees 
and suppliers can report potential ethics issues or 
concerns anonymously and in their own language.

fully investigated and appropriate actions were taken 
according to internal policies. The Ethics Committee 
reviewed all concerns of the cases, and approved 
the actions taken.
PEOPLE
People are important to us – our employees, 
our customers' employees, and the people in the 
communities and supply chain in which we operate. 
We respect and recognize the human element that 
goes into everything that makes ASMI a successful and respected company. To ensure this priority 
is not compromised, we set and maintain high 
standards for the way we conduct our business. 
Our standards go beyond compliance with all national 
and international laws and regulations, referencing 
global norms, industry codes of conduct, and sound 
business ethics practices that apply to us. They are 
about mutual respect and support. They are about 
doing what is right for everyone in our value chain.

ASMI CORPORATE RESPOSIBILITY REPORT 2015 |The standards reflect the principles laid out by the 
United Nations in the Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights. 
UPDATING OUR GLOBAL STANDARDS
In 2015 we revised our Global Employment 
Standards to ensure we applied labor management 
programs globally on a consistent basis and to fully 
align with the newly-revised 2015 EICC Code of 
Conduct, which includes standards for responsible 
management in all areas of labor, health and safety. 
We monitor developments relating to the EICC code 
and we are committed to upgrading our management 
practices to stay compliant with the code as it 
evolves. Revisions included direct labor-related 
policies and procedures, and the way we engage 
with labor agencies and their monitoring processes.
ATTRACTING THE RIGHT TALENT
We create exciting opportunities for rewarding careers 
in the communities in which we operate. Encouraging 
talented individuals to develop their careers 
strengthens both ASMI and local communities. 
To support our global recruitment activities, we have 
a comprehensive  careers section  on our corporate 
website  which includes content and information 
that helps potential employees understand our 
business and to inspire them to reach out to us 
for employment opportunities. Our career website 
also includes information about our policies and 
best practices, and our innovation and technology 
leadership. To attract and select the best employees 
for our business, we use referrals, advertisements, 
search and selection agencies and social media. 
INTERNSHIPS AT ASMI
Our internship program provides a great way for 
talented college graduates to make the transition into 
the workplace. We select interns based on the quality 
of their application, with a typical internship period 
running for six months. In some cases, such as 
a thesis project, this period may be extended. OUR ONBOARDING PROGRAM
We strongly believe in offering people a career, 
not just a position. We support personal and career 
development across the ASMI world, which begins as 
soon as a new employee joins us. All new employees 
are enrolled in our onboarding program. After the 
initial onboarding phase, we support them in their 
personal and career development through our global 
Talent Management program. 
DEVELOPING TALENT
To help develop talent and progress careers, we use 
performance evaluation and development, succession 
planning, and employee learning and development 
programs. We have an established talent management 
competency set and a talent scorecard in place 
covering all ASM locations, worldwide. In 2015 we 
enhanced our talent scorecard and process with 
the assessment of performance, potential, mobility, 
available successors and career opportunities. And, 
to support succession planning, we developed and 
held talent reviews in five key business sectors. 
We also launched our Director and Senior Director 
training program, which provides participants with an 
intense training week and includes a module on team 
dynamics and a real-time business case. 
OUR WORKFORCE
At the end of 2015 we had a total workforce of 
1,597 employees, representing 29 nationalities. 
The number of employees working in R&D grew 15%, 
demonstrating our continued drive and commitment 
to innovation.
RESPECTING LABOR
We respect prevailing labor relations and employment 
practices, including the right to be represented by 
trade unions and other employee organizations within 
the framework of applicable laws and regulations 
globally. At the end of 2015, 10% of our staff was 
covered by collective bargaining agreements, globally.

RESPECTING DIVERSITY
ASMI is an equal opportunity employer. We understand 
that every individual is unique. We recognize and 
respect the differences between individuals and 
we understand that these differences can include 
ethnicity, religious beliefs, national origin, age, gender, 
sexual orientation, family status, physical ability, 
experience and perspective. 
A diverse perspective
Recruiting and developing a diverse workforce 
gives us a wide range of perspectives, and allows 
us to explore and adopt new ideas and innovations 
in technology. It also allows us to better understand 
and meet the needs of our diverse customers and 
communities. Workforce diversity continues to be 
part of the strategic objectives that help us drive for 
innovation. We benefit from this diverse perspective 
and the advantages of bringing talented people of 
all backgrounds together to create new breakthrough 
innovations, turning today’s challenges into 
tomorrow’s opportunities. 
Breakdown of diversity figures
In 2015 we continued to maintain a high diversity 
of nationalities throughout the company with 
29 nationalities employed. The percentage of women 
in the company in the same time period was 14% of 
our workforce. In every area, we encourage female 
applicants to apply for open positions within the 
organization. In our 2015 Statutory annual report , 
the diversity of the Supervisory and Management 
Boards is discussed in a report from the Supervisory 
Board. Please reference the Statutory annual report  
for more information. HEALTH AND SAFETY
We believe that we can achieve ZERO HARM!  
in our health and safety performance. Our employees, 
suppliers' and customers' employees – where ASMI 
equipment is operated and maintained – deserve to 
work in environments and with equipment that are 
free of harm. We believe that all injuries and incidents 
are preventable and we continue to challenge our 
systems to make this belief a reality.
HEALTH AND SAFETY PROGRESS
In 2015 we made significant progress developing 
our health and safety program, progress that is 
reflected in our safety performance results. We 
conducted a top-to-bottom assessment of not just 
workplace hazards and risks, but also the culture 
and processes that drive our actions and interactions 
between employees, our products, customers and 
work environments. 
IMPROVEMENTS IN HIGH-RISK AREAS
We focused our improvements in two of our highest 
risk areas – our service organization and our 
engineering labs. We established plans to evaluate 
our systems across the dimensions that have inputs 
or possible effects on the overall safety of our 
employees. These dimensions run across areas that 
are not just related to physical hazards, but also take 
into account management, culture, organizations and 
communications. They provided us with an in-depth 
assessment of inputs and outputs that directly 
affect the safety of our employees. In response, 
we implemented multi-point action plans to further 
improve the safety of almost every part of our service 
and engineering operations. Key customers provided 
feedback on our service safety plan and progress 
was shared throughout the year. 
SUPPLY CHAIN ENVIRONMENT CR POLICY AND OBJECTIVES INTEGRATED CR STRATEGY ABOUT US35SOCIAL
ASMI CORPORATE RESPOSIBILITY REPORT 2015 |OUR SAFETY PERFORMANCE
In line with our goal of ZERO HARM! , we focus on 
preventing all injuries and incidents. We measure our 
safety performance using key measures including 
an Injury Rate indicator and Recordable Injury 
Rate. The Injury Rate is a measure of all first aid 
or greater injuries per every 100 employees. The 
Recordable Injury Rate measures cases that require 
a response greater than first aid (or serious injuries) 
per 100 employees. As shown below, we continue 
to significantly reduce our Injury Rate, with a 35% 
reduction in the case rate compared to 2014.

at the end of the third quarter, and analyzed in the 
fourth quarter. We will use the feedback we received 
to improve efforts we already have in progress and 
drive continuous improvement in 2016. 
SUPPORTING THE WELLBEING 
OF OUR EMPLOYEES
We care about our employees’ health and offer many 
different options for supporting their wellbeing. We 
have a health or wellness committee that helps plan 
activities that support employee health at our facilities. FITNESS REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM
In the US, we sponsor health and wellness programs 
that target weight loss and control. In one of these 
programs, we provide tools to fight obesity and 
promote an overall healthy lifestyle, including a fitness 
reimbursement benefit to promote physical activity. 
This program reimburses employees for a significant 
portion of their membership fees at a fitness facility. 
In 2015 a total of 238 employees (approximately 46% 
of our US employees) participated in the fitness 
reimbursement program, including employees who 
took advantage of a special partnership with a major 
nationwide fitness center that provided full membership 
costs for the first year of joining. 
OUR ‘WAY OF WELLNESS’ PROGRAM
In the US, we have a unique ‘Way of Wellness’ 
program where employees, and their co-insured 
spouse or partner, can benefit from reduced 
insurance premium contributions when they complete 
an annual physical exam with a medical doctor. 
In 2015, 97% of our US employees took advantage 
of this benefit, which helps employees proactively 
understand their health and maintain positive 
relationships with healthcare providers, leading to 
a more healthy and productive workforce. This is 
the highest participation rate we have achieved 
in the five years we have offered this program.
INFORMATION SECURITY 
AND TRADE COMPLIANCE
As an innovation leader in advanced technology 
in the semiconductor industry, our breakthrough 
technologies, intellectual property and sensitive 
information about our customers, suppliers, 
and employees are our greatest technological 
assets. Any breach of information systems could 
adversely affect our finances and operating results. 
We understand that rising global security threats 
have increased the importance of effective IT security 
measures and have responded appropriately. Our 
response includes proper management processes 
and controls to protect against unauthorized systems 
access and loss of valuable information. 
SUPPLY CHAIN ENVIRONMENT CR POLICY AND OBJECTIVES INTEGRATED CR STRATEGY ABOUT US36SOCIAL
ASMI CORPORATE RESPOSIBILITY REPORT 2015 |EXTERNAL SECURITY ASSESSMENT 
In 2014, to ensure effective information security, 
we contracted with an external consulting firm 
to conduct a security assessment on our information 
systems. In 2015 the results were returned and 
identified risk areas. In response, we developed 
and executed corrective actions. We improved 
long-term information security strategies and 
program improvements in the following focus areas: 
 ›information classification and controls;
 ›employee training on information security;
 ›cyber security. 
Our goal is to drive continuous improvements 
in information security to protect our Intellectual 
property, mitigate risks and achieve data security for 
our customers, employees and other stakeholders. 
PRODUCT AND TRADE COMPLIANCE
Being a good global corporate citizen, ASMI 
has an in-house Global Trade Compliance (GTC) 
team. The team is responsible for developing 
and maintaining an effective program, guidance, 
and enforcement to enable worldwide trade 
compliance with all applicable import and export 
laws and regulations of the United States and 
all other countries where ASMI operates. To provide 
the best support within the organization, the 
GTC team welcomes questions and information 
inquiries from employees and stakeholders. In 
addition, a bi-monthly newsletter also provides 
a detailed overview of recent international trade 
developments and events that are impacting 
ASMI business practice. INVESTMENT AND PARTNERSHIP 
FOR INNOVATION 
Our greatest contribution to society is innovation that 
leads to faster computing, greater productivity and 
enhanced energy efficiency of electronics. In 2015 
our investments in research and development came 
to a total of €93.0 million. The outcomes of our 
research and development efforts are technological 
innovations, which can be measured by the number 
of new patent filings we make. In 2015 we increased 
our intellectual property holdings with 85 initial 
patent filings. For further information on research 
and development, see our Statutory annual report .

CARING FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS 
IN SOUTH KOREA
In November 2015, ASM Korea employees 
participated in volunteer work by bringing heating 
briquettes to people living in impoverished conditions. 
ASM Korea donated a total of 20,000 briquettes 
that went to low-income households and the elderly 
living alone outside of Seoul. Volunteer employees 
personally delivered 6,000 of the briquettes to 
40 households on one day. More than 120 employees 
took part in the volunteer work, which made the 
local TV station news. An ASM Korea representative 
interviewed for the broadcast said, “It is pleasing to 
give small charity and share our benevolence to our 
neighbors in need. As part of our value and culture, 
ASM will keep on thinking of ways we can contribute 
and give back to the society.”
FOSTERING TEENS’ INTEREST 
IN TECHNOLOGY
With an aging population in Europe, and a decreasing 
number of teenagers in science classes, the industry 
foresees a shortage of engineers within the next 
few decades. In order to address this issue, the 
Dutch industry has set up a collaboration program 
between the government and high schools called 
JetNet. JetNet aims to inspire children to learn more 
about technology and to stimulate them to consider 
a technical education and career. We support JetNet, 
and joined the platform in 2015 by developing a 
relationship with Almere High School, which wants 
to promote technology classes.We organized lectures at the school, as well as 
on-site experiments and technical games during 
a ‘students day’. We also held an exhibition project 
at the ASM site, giving students the opportunity 
to directly understand and respond to ASM's 
technological challenges. The activities were 
organized by talented engineers and sponsoring 
managers and received enthusiastic reactions from 
both the school, as well as from ASM employees. 
In 2016, we look forward to strengthening the 
collaboration between ASM and the Almere school 
system, by expanding our joint activities, possibly 
by facilitating one-week internships for the middle 
classes, and providing room for the students to 
participate in International Science Olympiads.
SUPPORTING MILITARY VETERANS

their spouses. The race and the scholarship fund 
honor the sacrifice of Pat Tillman, an American 
football player who joined the US Army following 
the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US. 
Tillman was killed in Afghanistan. In the US, 
we have sponsored employees participating in

We developed our supply chain code compliance 
process and integrated it with our supply chain 
management system, including commitment 
requirements and measures to help enforce supplier 
responsibility and accountability. Please see the 
chart on this page, for our supply chain code 
compliance process. SUPPLIER SELF-ASSESSMENTS 
AND AUDITS
We adopted the Electronic Industry Citizenship 
Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct as our supplier 
code of conduct. By directly adopting the EICC code 
and establishing sustainable management systems 
matching the industry standard supplier assessment 
process, we have set high targets for our suppliers. 
To enhance overall supply chain accountability 
to the EICC code and standards, we follow the 
EICC-recommended risk assessment tools and 
processes and introduced EICC Self-Assessments 
Questionnaires (SAQ) to our critical suppliers. Building 
on our success in rolling out the supplier code of 
conduct, in 2015 we made this a global process 
and documented it as part of our supply chain risk 
assessment process.

ASMI CORPORATE RESPOSIBILITY REPORT 2015 |CRITICAL SUPPLIER IDENTIFICATION 
PROCESS 
Using the identification process, we determine 
whether a supplier is critical or not by using criteria 
such as the amount we spend with them, how many 
similar or alternative suppliers exist, and the amount of 
time we would need to switch suppliers if we had to.
SUPPLIER EXPECTATIONS
At the beginning of 2015, our head of Global Supply 
Chain Management let all our critical suppliers know 
what our expectations are for supplier responsibility 
including compliance with the Supplier Code of 
Conduct, ASM Corporate Responsibility (CR) policy 
and ASM Conflict Minerals policy.
SUPPLIER TRAINING
As part of our supplier capability-building activities, 
we delivered EEIC Code, Supplier Expectation and 
Conflict Materials training webinars.
HIGH-RISK SUPPLIERS COMPLETED AUDITS
High-risk suppliers, whom we had identified through 
a 2014 Supplier Self-Assessment, completed third-
party EICC audits in 2015.
SUPPLIER RISK SELF-ASSESSMENTS
Our supplier risk assessment process and self-
assessments helps us to identify and measure social, 
environmental and ethical risks in our supply chain. 
This helps us to better understand how our suppliers 
are meeting the EICC code and standards. After 
analyzing risk assessment results, we work closely 
with our suppliers to implement corrective actions 
to ensure continuous improvement in complying with 
the EICC code. In 2015 more than 80% of our critical 
suppliers completed the required self-assessment, 
which is equivalent to more than 92% of our total 
baseline spend with critical suppliers.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND SUPPLIER 
CAPABILITY BUILDING
We operate at multiple sites and have partnerships 
with suppliers from 24 countries. So we have to 
be prepared to respond quickly to a wide range of 
unplanned events. That means working proactively 
to ensure our supply chain is reliable by assessing and 
managing risks. Our supply chain risk management 
process consists of a combination of supplier risk 
assessments, supplier self-assessments, EICC audits, 
and training and capability building activities to help 
our supply chain to be both resilient and responsible. We recognize that the EICC Code of Conduct is 
new to some of our suppliers. They need guidance 
and time to help ensure their management 
systems conform to industry standards. We not 
only communicate our expectations clearly at 
the beginning of each year, we also offer them 
free webinars to help them understand the code 
requirements, the measurement methods, and help 
to gradually build up their knowledge and enhance 
their management systems. 
In 2016 we will continue to enhance our 
communication and training. We will partner with 
suppliers to develop their capability to conform to 
the code and improve their performance. This will 
help increase the resilience of our supply chain. 
We also plan to partner with suppliers to identify 
opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions in the supply chain and help us to continue 
to improve our performance and reduce our total 
environmental impact. 
CONFLICT MINERALS
‘Conflict minerals’ are those mined in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries. 
Profits from the sale of these extracted minerals may 
directly or indirectly benefit those involved in rebel 
conflicts and human rights’ violations. These minerals 
and the metals created from them (tin, tantalum, 
tungsten and gold) can make their way into the 
supply chains for products used around the world, 
including the semiconductor industry.
CONFLICT MINERALS POLICY AND 
SUPPLY CHAIN DUE DILIGENCE 
ASM does not directly source minerals from mines 
in the DRC or adjoining countries. To trace the origin 
of these metals would take the due diligence of 
gathering data from many tiers of the supply chain, 
including mines, traders, exporters, smelters, 
refiners, metal producers, component manufacturers 
and contract manufacturers. ASM is committed 
to sourcing components and materials from 
companies that are committed to protecting 
human rights, upholding ethics, environmental 
and social sustainability. In 2013, we published 
our Conflict Minerals Policy  and engaged with 
critical suppliers with Reasonable Country of 
Origin Inquiries (RCOI). In 2014 we joined the most 
established and widely-recognized Conflict Free 
Sourcing Initiative (CFSI), which brings together 
the electronics, automotive and other industries

CONFLICT MINERALS DUE DILIGENCE
We also launched our supply chain Conflict 
Minerals minerals due diligence process. In 2015 
we continued to communicate, train and survey our 
active suppliers, and collected supply chain sourcing 
information on the sources of tin, tantalum, tungsten 
and gold with the industry standard Conflict-Free 
Sourcing Initiative template, the Conflict Minerals 
Reporting Template (CMRT). Using our due diligence 
process for supply chain conflict minerals, which 
includes our Conflict Minerals Policy, supplier 
communication, supplier survey and data verification 
and analysis, we identified the smelters our critical 
suppliers are sourcing from, and established the 
traceability to eventually achieve our goal of assuring 
DRC conflict-free products and components. COMPLIANCE WITH US LEGISLATION
As part of our compliance with US legislation, 
we filed our 2014 Conflict Minerals Report with 
the US Securities and Exchange Commission, 
in May 2015. The filing and current information 
on the due diligence process and our policy can 
be found on our website , in the Supply Chain 
section under Corporate Responsibility. As of  
21 August 2015, ASMI no longer traded under US 
SEC governance, and will no longer be filing SEC 
reports. However, our commitment to the EICC 
Code of Conduct stands and we will continue our 
active participation and contribution to the Conflict 
Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI), and our engagement 
with relevant other stakeholders including the 
European Parliament as well as international NGOs 
through the engagement of CFSI to ensure our 
industry alignment.
