Welcome to our first Corporate Responsibility Report!Message from  
our CEO
About Maxim6February 2019 Report   | 31Message from Our CEO
Tunç Doluca 
Maxim was founded on time-tested values and principles that have defined who we are 
for over 35 years. They’re rooted in our desire to challenge the status quo and make a 
difference, and they fuel our passion to create innovative products that enable new and 
exciting inventions. For us, the path forward is obvious. It entails designing “green” products, 
conserving resources, and fostering healthy work environments for our employees. And 
doing it all responsibly.
Designing environmentally friendly products is 
nothing new to us. In fact, we’ve been doing it since 
1983, with high-efficiency DC-DC power converters, 
battery-management integrated circuits (ICs), and 
low-power products such as amplifiers. We’ve 
worked hard to make these and other products 
responsibly, through ethical sourcing, and by 
reducing the amount of materials we use, including 
hazardous materials.  
Today, the world is challenged by the impact of 
climate change and the increased demand for more 
green products. At the same time, we’re now seeing 
ways we can help the world become more energy 
efficient, through smaller power supplies, greater 
board densities, improved battery life, reduced heat, 
and higher reliability.  While the technical challenges 
of designing green solutions are numerous, our 
proven track record of solving these difficult 
engineering problems gives me confidence that we 
can succeed.
We’ve also worked diligently to make Maxim 
buildings greener. We have Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design (LEED)-certified facilities worldwide, which have a smaller environmental 
footprint and facilitate a healthier, more enjoyable 
work environment. Additionally, we’ve made 
reductions in energy, waste, and emissions, 
especially in the last three years.  
Finally, we’ve evolved our culture to become 
more transparent, diverse, and inclusive. We have 
adopted a Pledge of Respect and Fairness, publicly 
disclosing our commitment towards diversity and 
inclusion, pay equity, preventing harassment and 
protecting individuals from retaliation. We’ve 
updated and publicized our corporate strategy. 
We are focusing on helping managers recognize 
unconscious bias and apply new thinking to 
developing and expanding our workforce. We  
also encourage and support employees in their  
quests to help those in need.
We’ve come a long way.  And we’ll continue  
to make and report our progress.  I hope  
you enjoy reading our first Corporate  
Responsibility Report.Maxim is committed 
to building a smarter, 
more sustainable future 
through the products and 
technologies we innovate, 
design and manufacture,  
as well as through how  
we treat and respect  
one another.

fabrication and test facilities in the manufacture 
of our products. Historically, our internal wafer 
production occurred at one of our three wafer 
fabrication facilities at Beaverton, Oregon, San 
Jose, California and San Antonio, Texas. During 
fiscal year 2016, we completed the closure of 
our San Jose facility, as well as the sale of our 
San Antonio facility to TowerJazz Texas, Inc. 
Production from these sites was transferred to 
our remaining Beaverton location and to our

management 
Our Enterprise Risk Management framework 
outlines the framework and process for 
identifying and managing risks related to 
the achievement of our strategic, financial, 
compliance and operational objectives.
Our Chief Corporate Compliance Officer is directly 
responsible for risk management. He meets regularly with 
the Audit Committee, Governance Committee and the full 
Board of Directors on the topic of risk. He also oversees  
the Corporate Compliance and Ethics Team, as well as 
internal investigations. 
Our Audit Committee reviews and discusses with 
management, the head of internal audit and the independent 
auditor any significant risks or exposures as well as the 
Company’s policies and process with respect to risk 
assessment and risk management. It is the responsibility of 
the Audit Committee to assess the steps management has 
taken to mitigate such risks, except those risks for which 
oversight has been assigned to other committees of the 
Board of Directors. 
The full Board of Directors also reviews all enterprise and 
operational risks, including cyber security and privacy.
Please see our 2018 Annual Report  for 
additional information on key risks and 
associated factors.Corporate responsibility  
governance
Maxim’s CEO and Executive Leadership Team, reporting to the Board of Directors, are 
responsible for the day-to-day conduct of the Company’s business, including economic, 
social, environmental and governance aspects.
Additionally, the Governance Committee of  
our Board of Directors oversees certain 
environmental and social objectives of the 
Company. Our Corporate Responsibility (CR) 
Steering Team is responsible for creating the 
Corporate Responsibility Report and measuring 
performance, and works to implement specific 
programs and initiatives. The Executive Team is 
accountable for performance outcomes. 
Our Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics  and 
Corporate Social Responsibility  are our credo and 
outline our ethical, environmental and social 
commitments to our employees. We request our 
suppliers and foundry partners to meet the same high standards. The Codes, managed through  
our Legal Department, are guided by international 
standards which include the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, ILO International 
Labor Standards and OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises. 
We support the Responsible Business Alliance  
(RBA) Code of Conduct objectives by undergoing 
on-site audits and completing the RBA corporate 
and facility Self-Assessment Questionnaires. 
We make our data available via the RBA-Online 
tool, making it easy for our customers to find the 
information they need.
Governance & Ethics2
February 2019 Report   | 8Assessing emerging issues 
In 2018, we evaluated environmental, social 
and governance topics that are most critical to 
our business. We reviewed feedback from key 
stakeholders and reviewed inputs from the business, 
when evaluating whether a topic was a priority for 
us (Maxim Materiality Assessment Process figure). 
We assess significance of each topic in two ways: 
if it impacts our business in terms of growth, cost, 
risk or trust, and if it significantly influences the 
assessments and decisions of our key stakeholders.
Through analysis of our priority topics, eleven 
broad themes emerged:
 •Anti-Corruption & Ethics
 •Diversity & Inclusion
 • Employee Attraction & Retention
 • Employee Safety & Wellbeing
 • Energy Efficiency & Climate Change
 • Human Rights & Labor Issues
 • Intellectual Property Protection &  
Competitive Behavior
 • Product Life Cycle Management
 •Regulatory Compliance
 • Sustainable Economic Growth
 • Waste & Water ManagementPrioritizing topics of focus has helped us to  
refine our strategic efforts and resource allocation, 
update our strategy, and communicate effectively 
with key stakeholders. Maxim also identifies 
emerging issues through its membership and active 
participation in industry associations such as the 
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).

Operating ethically 
Business integrity, ethics and compliance have 
been part of the foundation of Maxim’s success 
and ongoing growth. We strive to conduct our 
operations in accordance with applicable laws 
and regulations of the relevant jurisdictions. We 
promote ethical behavior and maintain an open-
door approach that encourages employees to talk 
to supervisors, managers, their human resources 
business partner, the anonymous hotline, or the 
Chief Compliance Officer, when in doubt about the 
best course of action in any situation. 
Our Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics  and 
Corporate Social Responsibility  reinforce our values 
and define our expectations for ethical behavior 
of our employees, officers, and nonemployee 
directors. The Codes apply globally. Maxim 
requires that employees certify they have read 
and agree to adhere to the Maxim Integrity Guide, 
the foundation of which is built on the Company's 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Employees 
must also take training courses related to the 
Codes, including topics related to discrimination, 
harassment, retaliation, and conflicts of interest.  
In 2018 we expanded anti-harassment training  
to include all employees globally. Maxim reached  
over 99% training completion rates in 2018  
for all employees assigned training, related to  
Maxim's Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics, Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption, and 
Harassment Prevention.Employees have a responsibility to report 
suspected violations of the Codes—to their 
immediate supervisor or the Chief Compliance 
Officer. We provide a toll-free hotline and a  
third-party website via EthicsPoint as a means  
for anonymously reporting concerns. Maxim  
is committed to ensuring that anyone who  
raises a good-faith concern will be protected  
from retaliation. 
We support the objectives of the RBA Code  
of Conduct which promote trust and underpin  
our “direct” supply chain relationships. Learn

Building solutions for tomorrow 
In 2018, Maxim celebrated 35 years of empowering design innovation for our customers 
who then develop products that provide society with environmental and social benefits, 
such as reducing energy consumption, reducing the carbon footprint of operations, and 
improving people’s quality of life.
Over the years, we have built a resilient and 
long-lasting business through our expertise in 
high-performance analog, particularly in power 
management products. Our customers tell us that 
the performance and power efficiency of Maxim 
products sets us apart from our competitors and 
gives us lasting differentiation in each of our end 
markets: automotive, industrial, healthcare, data 
center and mobility. Our customers also appreciate 
that we design and manufacture our products in 
a responsible manner, always looking for ways 
to improve the environmental footprint of our 
products through using less hazardous substances 
and ensuring that our value chain meets high 
ethical, human rights, health and safety, and 
environmental standards.Maxim’s core strength is in facilitating more 
efficient power management in the end market 
applications that use our products.  This energy 
efficiency lens is comprehensively applied along 
our entire portfolio, along with other design 
attributes such as reliability, smaller footprints, 
accuracy, and cost providing key differentiators. 
While energy efficiency has been a long time focus 
for Maxim, our products are also used in end use 
applications with significant social benefits. We’re 
proud of the environmental and social benefits  
our products facilitate for our customers and the 
end consumer. Read on for examples of our  
recent innovations.

Design innovations
AUTOMATING FACTORIES THAT ARE SAFER  
AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT
Maxim’s analog ICs are contributing to the 
revolution in factory automation. Sensors, 
actuators and programmable logic controllers 
in ‘smart factories’ require efficient power 
management that is robust for harsh industrial 
environments, minimizes heat generation, and 
fits into small footprints. These requirements 
play to our strengths, while our robust IO-Link 
products enable network access to sensors and 
actuators using existing wiring, an easy upgrade 
for factory owners. These improvements not only 
enable more energy efficient industrial systems, 
but automation also often has a safety benefit, 
removing workers from potentially unsafe working 
conditions, and enabling process control from a  
remote location.POWERING MORE EFFICIENT VEHICLES
Industry experts predict that by 2025, 25% of 
vehicles on the road will be electric vehicles (EVs). 
Maxim is developing products that optimize the 
efficiency of EVs. We have solutions that improve 
the efficiency of lithium ion cells, used in EVs, 
which must operate in harsh environments and 
be able to withstand long periods of inactivity. 
The hundreds of battery cells in EVs must be 
precisely managed, and the voltages between 
these batteries must be carefully monitored and 
balanced. This is where fast and accurate battery 
management systems (BMS) come into play. Our 
BMS systems extend battery life, vehicle driving 
range and enable higher reliability and safety of 
the battery cells required for electric vehicles.Industrial equipment's control power 
supply inputs must meet 60V input and low 
thermal dissipation for reliable operation 
and standards compliance. With Maxim's 
Himalaya DC-DC converters, we can 
consistently meet our requirements  
for the SINAMICS Drives Family.

IMPROVING PATIENT DIAGNOSIS  
AND TREATMENT
Maxim’s innovative solutions have been  
enhancing the capabilities of healthcare products 
since the launch of the company. Nowadays,  
many human-body signals traditionally monitored 
in a clinical environment (i.e., heart rate, blood 
oxygen, EKG/ECG, ultrasound) may now be 
collected through a wearable product or device.  
Our products enable these applications and  
provide a reliable, precise, low power, accurate  
and cost-conscious option that facilitates the 
capture of patient data for improved diagnosis  
and treatment.ENABLING MORE EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS
According to third-party market research, over 
90% of data traffic stays within the data center, 
including data traffic local to each server rack and 
from server rack to server rack. As the volume 
of data traffic continues to increase, high-speed 
optical connectivity within the data center becomes 
paramount. Maxim’s optical connectivity products 
are best-in-class for high-speed data transport. 
The cost of ownership is also extremely important 
for cloud customers because they are the ones 
paying the energy bill. Our power management 
products for servers are efficient and easy to 
incorporate in designs. These products have already 
been recognized by our key cloud customers as 
they help reduce energy use, which drives down the 
cost of data center ownership.
The name of the game is 
miniaturization and low power, and 
Maxim has the best solution for both.

While Maxim’s Environmental Policy  is at the heart of our 
environmental sustainability efforts, our Environmental 
Management System  ensures that the design, manufacturing, 
testing, marketing and sales of analog/mixed-signal 
semiconductor products meets and exceeds our compliance 
obligations. Additionally, our Product Sustainability Program  
assesses the health, safety and environmental impacts of our 
analog devices for continual improvement. This program ensures 
our compliance with relevant regulations around substances 
of concern (REACH, RoHS, ELV, Battery Directive) and protects 
people in contact with our products at any point in the value 
chain from exposure to hazardous substances. Maxim's Policy 
on Restricted and Hazardous Substances  holds us accountable to 
providing the market with end products that are compliant with all 
applicable environmental product regulations and requirements.
We continuously monitor developments in the global regulatory 
landscape, and provide our customers with regular updates online  
to facilitate transparency on the materials and environmental 
substances found in our end products.

Extending high standards into our  
supply chain
At Maxim, we believe that the social, 
environmental and ethical aspects of suppliers’  
and subcontractors' performance are critical 
elements of our long-term business success. 
Supply chain responsibility is embedded in 
our policies and practices through our Codes of 
Corporate Social Responsibility  and Business Conduct 
and Ethics . We also support the objectives of the 
Responsible Business Association (RBA) Code  
of Conduct. 
Our procurement process promotes sustainable 
sourcing and develops long-term social and 
environmental standards and practices.
Our Code of Corporate Social Responsibility 
covers the following scope of our supplier 
practices:
 • Labor and Human Rights – including prevention 
of child and forced labor and discrimination, and 
promoting fair labor practices
 • Health and Safety  – including occupational safety, 
emergency preparedness and industrial hygiene
 • Environmental – including obtaining appropriate 
environmental permits, compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations prohibiting 
or restricting specific hazardous substances, 
and monitoring and control of air emissions, 
wastewater and solid waste discharges • Ethics  – including prohibition of bribery, 
corruption, extortion, embezzlement, and 
retaliation against whistleblowers, and  
promoting fair business standards and 
community engagement
 • Management systems  – requiring suppliers  
to have an ongoing process to obtain feedback 
from their workers on practices related to the 
Codes and foster continuous improvement
We require adherence by all vendors and suppliers 
to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
If suppliers suspect violations within Maxim, 
they are encouraged to report them through our 
Compliance Officer at +1 (408) 601-5866, by 
email at compliance.officer@maximintegrated.com ,  
or anonymously through a third-party hotline .
Maxim has worked to reduce conflict minerals 
in our supply chain. Conflict minerals are those 
that fuel human rights abuses in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo. We released a public policy 
statement  describing our approach to conflict 
minerals, required our suppliers to comply with our 
Conflict Minerals Policy, and became a member of 
the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative in 2011. As of 
2017, 100% of our new suppliers comply with the

Managing environmental  
performance 
As a leading member of the global semiconductor industry, Maxim has acted to reduce our 
impacts and strengthen our environmental performance. 
Our Environmental Policy  demonstrates our 
commitment to:
 •  Prevent or reduce pollution through programs 
that reduce environmental impacts and conserve 
natural resources
 • Understand and commit to comply with legal and  
other requirements
 • Review environmental objectives and  
targets and set guidelines for reduction of 
environmental impacts
 • Evaluate the effectiveness of and continually 
improve our Environmental Management  
Systems (EMS)
We pursue these commitments primarily through 
our ISO 14001 Environmental Management 
System (EMS), which addresses both customer 
and regulatory concerns via natural resource and 
risk and opportunity management. Identifying and 
assessing water and climate-related risks is part 
of the EMS, where all new or modified processes 
are evaluated using a change control process 
that measures risk, the environmental impact 
and the amount of resource consumption and 
waste generated. Since 2004, we’ve implemented these ISO standards at key facilities, including 
our semiconductor fabs, testing facilities and our 
headquarters campus location, representing 72% 
of our total real estate footprint. Through our EMS, 
we’re continually assessing potential impacts 
associated with our activities and setting targets 
to ensure we are adopting industry best practices 
and continuous improvement programs. We verify 
conformance with the ISO Standards during regular 
environmental audits. In 2017 and 2018, there were 
no negative comments from outside auditors and  
zero major non-conformities.
To ensure we are going beyond compliance, we 
pursue LEED certification for our facilities. As of 
2018, 620 thousand square feet of our facilities 
are LEED certified. Our Bangalore, India office is 
a Platinum LEED facility, our San Jose, California 
headquarters is a Gold LEED facility and our 
Oregon and Arizona offices are Silver LEED facilities. 
We are currently pursuing future LEED certification 
for our Operations Center in the Philippines and in 
other locations.For more information on

February 2019 Report   | 16Emissions & energy
Maxim is proud to have reduced our greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity over the last 3 years.
An intensity of 98 metric tons CO2e (carbon 
dioxide equivalent) per $1 million in revenue in 
2015 decreased to 58 metric tons in 2016 and 
42 metric tons in 2017—an overall reduction of 
57%. Concurrently, our energy intensity—GWh 
consumed per $1 billion in revenue—dropped 
by 48% from 2015 to 2017. These reductions 
reflect achievement of our previous five-year goals 
established in 2012 to pursue normalized reductions 
of 10% for both emissions and energy by 2017;  
once this expired, we established new rolling targets 
of annual 3% normalized reductions based on 
annual revenue. 
Maxim continuously looks for efficiency 
improvement opportunities that result in GHG 
emissions and energy reductions as well as cost savings. Over the years, we’ve implemented 
projects ranging from process improvements, 
facility installations, to power generation.
We’ve also strategically procured cleaner electricity 
for our larger manufacturing and test locations. 
Maxim entered into a power purchasing agreement 
for our Cavite, Philippines test operations whereby 
the site consumed 100% geothermal energy in  
2017 and 2018. Additionally, in 2017 we procured 
35% of the electricity for both the Beaverton fab 
and the San Jose headquarters campus from 
renewable sources. In total, 48% of the electricity 
consumed by Maxim in 2017 was generated from 
renewable sources. 
Our VOC emissions increased modestly by 
approximately 5% in 2017 from 2016, due to a 
higher level of semiconductor IC production in 2017.
48%
OF THE ELECTRICITY 
CONSUMED BY MAXIM IN 
2017 WAS  GENERATED FROM 
RENEWABLE SOURCES.Greenhouse gas inventory calculations were performed using the U.S. 
EPA reporting guidance. Emission factors for fuels were sourced from 
the US EPA’s GHG Database. Electricity emission factors were sourced 
from the 2014 IPCC Report for 35% of the electricity consumed 
from identified renewable sources and the US EPA Power Profile for 
65% of the electricity consumed from unspecified sources; factors 
for the Cavite and Chonburi facilities were sourced directly from the 
electricity provider. Maxim’s GHG inventories have not been verified 
by an independent third party and are estimates. Data reflects

Investing in efficiency 
Several initiatives at key locations helped us achieve our 
previous emissions goal and continue to provide ongoing 
energy and cost savings. These include:
 Beaverton fab:
 •  In 2017, efficiency process projects reduced the usage of  
several greenhouse gases, preventing over 5,000 metric tons  
of CO2e from being emitted annually.
 • Our upgraded glycol chiller piping saves an estimated 50,000 
kWh annually.
 • An LED lighting upgrade of approximately 10,000 lamps,  
targeted for completion in 2019, is projected to save over 
1,757,000 kWh annually, or nearly 2% of the facility’s electricity 
consumption in 2017.
 San Jose headquarters:
 • A Bloom Energy fuel cell system activated in August 2014 has 
avoided 770 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually.
 • During 2016 and 2017, we invested in a roofing program which 
resulted in annual energy savings of 600,000 kWh, the equivalent 
of 286 metric tons of CO2.
 • Our electric vehicle charging stations at San Jose headquarters  
are calculated to have reduced emissions by approximately  
4 metric tons annually since 2016.

February 2019 Report   | 18Conserving water
The Environmental, Health, and Safety and 
Sustainability (EHS&S) group is responsible for 
monitoring and tracking our water usage across 
our manufacturing processes. To ensure we 
understand and minimize potential risks, Maxim 
completed a water stress analysis of our global 
operations using the World Resources Institute 
Aqueduct tool to determine if our facilities are in 
stressed water basins. The analysis determined 
that 72% of Maxim’s calendar 2017 water usage 
volume was drawn from low-stress water basin 
areas while only 8% of water usage was drawn 
from high-stress water basin areas (Total Water 
Usage by Water Basin Stress Level). Maxim is consistently undertaking new initiatives 
to reduce the water used at our sites, which 
led to us exceed our five-year goal of reducing 
water usage by 5% by 2017. Since 2015, we’re 
proud to have achieved a reduction in our water 
intensity—the water consumed per employee 
in cubic meters—by 50% (Operational Water 
Impacts). Under the guidance of our Technology 
and Manufacturing Group, we have committed 
to a new target of reducing our water usage by a 
normalized 3% rate per year (based on annual 
revenue) in our fabrication and testing processes.Where possible, we strive to recycle or reuse 
the water from our operations to mitigate the 
risk of depleting local water supplies. At our San 
Jose headquarters, which uses 3% of our total 
water volume, we’ve implemented several water 
reduction projects, from low-water landscapes 
to modern kitchen equipment and restroom 
facilities that consume less water. Meanwhile, 
our Beaverton fab uses 72% of our total water 
withdrawals based on volume. Approximately 14% 
of the initial water used is reused in our abatement 
scrubbers or for gray water purposes, such as 
restroom toilets. Overall, Maxim is currently 
recycling 10% of the total water volume used.
Water discharges are also an important focus area, 
particularly for our wafer fab, where chemicals 
and other pollutants may be present in the 
effluent. Our close attention to wastewater system 
management was recognized at our Beaverton fab, 
which received a Certificate of Excellence from the 
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality.

Waste management
Responsible waste management at our operations is vital due to the nature of the 
materials used during the manufacturing process. If not handled appropriately, these 
inputs could be released into the environment via the air, water, or as solid waste. 
We surpassed our five-year goal of a 10% 
reduction in hazardous waste by 2017, pursuing 
initiatives big and small to reduce our impacts. 
From 2016 – 2017, we achieved a 24% decrease  
in hazardous waste and a 39% decrease in  
non-hazardous waste. In fact, our Beaverton fab 
removed 5.8 tons of waste simply by reducing paper cups. Our new rolling targets are annual 3% 
normalized reductions based on annual revenue.
Safety is also a key component of these efforts.  
We’ve avoided on-site hazardous spills over the 
last seven years, helping manage for both airborne 
and water pollutants.

FY 2019 CSR Report   |  20Earning a reputation as a great 
place to work
Our people are fundamental to the ongoing success of our business. We are committed to 
building a culture and working environment where our employees can do their best work 
and feel valued for their contributions.
To ensure we are meeting their needs and earning 
a reputation as a great place to work, we actively 
listen and respond with leading programs to 
develop, recognize and empower our employee 
base and to foster their health and wellness. 
We are also continually working to build an  
inclusive culture where our collective efforts 
leverage diverse points of view and enable us  
to realize superior solutions. We are enhancing 
our commitment to building an inclusive work 
environment, and in early 2019, initiated Maxim's 
Pledge of Respect and Fairness, shown in its full 
text on  pg 25 . We see recruiting and developing a 
diverse workforce as both a company imperative 
and a competitive advantage. Our job swap 
initiative, Maxim University, and intern programs 
help empower employees to grow. We also look 
to increase inclusion and diversity of thought 
within our organization. In fact, senior executives 
are expected to promote Employee Training and 
Development initiatives.We formalize employee feedback via our employee 
engagement survey, issued on a periodic basis.  
We also provide an avenue for employee feedback 
on individual performance through our performance 
management process. This input is vital as we 
evaluate and adjust our initiatives to meet the 
changing needs of our employee base. Maxim 
has an internal relations function that provides 
a mechanism for employees to raise feedback 
regarding the company and management. 
The feedback is conveyed anonymously and 
confidentially to upper management to analyze  
and implement changes and improvements,  
as appropriate. In addition to the above  
programs, we hold All-Hands meetings  
at the company-wide level and within our  
business groups.

Investing in our people
Throughout 2017 and 2018, we utilized our Development Planning Process  to help 
employees realize career growth and success. All employees are encouraged by 
management to set career goals that are meaningful for them, and develop Individual 
Development Plans that outline the steps to achieve those goals.
We continued to encourage employees to broaden 
their knowledge, skills and abilities through Maxim 
University, or MaximU . In 2018 we provided over 
5,000 salaried employees continual training via an 
online portal that is accessible globally, 24 hours 
a day. Maxim also offers a tuition reimbursement  
program to encourage employees to broaden their 
on-the-job knowledge, skills, and abilities as we 
strongly believe that educational advancement 
will enhance our growth potential through the 
individual growth of our employees. 
The Developing Professionals of Maxim (DPoM)  
offers a community of welcoming peers and 
helping hands to employees seeking to find their 
place within the company. DPoM‘s mission is 
to provide a platform for professional growth, 
personal development, local outreach, and social 
networking. In 2018, the DPoM Workshop Series 
was launched to allow peer-to-peer training on 
skills such as Microsoft Excel, Personal Finance, 
and Tableau. The group also hosted small-group lunches between members and Executives to 
facilitate an open line of communication between 
management and employees. DPoM has also 
served as a means for Maxim employees to 
give back to the local community, organizing 
events such as food sorts at the Second Harvest 
Food Bank and group donations to the Ronald 
McDonald House. 
In 2016, Maxim launched a novel approach to 
hiring talent for the Automotive Business Unit 
(ABU), which experienced tremendous growth in 
a short period of time. Recognizing the need for 
more layout designers to meet industry demands, 
Randall Wollschlager, VP of the ABU, pitched the 
Junior Layout Design Program to the executive 
staff, where individuals with little to no layout 
experience or education could receive training 
as an opportunity to engage local community 
members to develop career skills. 
Connie Phillips, Senior Layout Designer, and Anthony Valliere, 
Layout Designer, prepared the six-month curriculum to train 
program participants to be qualified for a Junior Layout Designer 
position with Maxim. At the end of the program, consisting 
of lectures, labs, a midterm, and a final exam, all students 
successfully graduated the course and transitioned to be  
full-time members of the layout team. The team launched a 
second class in 2017 with graduates from the 2016 program 
acting as mentors for the new students. The next class of 
trainees began in late April 2018.

 Another way we invest in our people is by having a well-developed summer 
internship program, hiring interns from universities around the world to help build  
a robust pipeline of future Maxim teammates. The program provides the 
opportunity to gain hands-on professional experience within an innovative and 
global company. Over the last 3 years, Maxim has had approximately 480 interns 
throughout 11 countries.
A great differentiator of our program is a high level of interaction with executive 
leadership, as well as exposure to cutting edge technology through project-
based work. In fact, in our San Jose headquarters, summer interns receive regular 
interaction with our CEO, Tunç Doluca, where they may ask questions on their 
minds during "Walks with Tunç." They are also invited to test themselves against 
our CEO's table tennis skills during an end-of-summer tournament. Participants are 
also afforded several networking opportunities with peers and local leadership and 
are assigned a mentor and peer ‘buddy’ to facilitate ongoing support. The program 
culminates with the interns presenting to their group’s leadership about their 
experience at the summer intern symposium. These myriad experiences contribute 
to a robust program that fosters technical, professional, and social development. 5
In March 2018, Maxim and Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU) 
initiated a long-term strategic partnership that will help build our 
visibility and recruiting efforts with Chinese universities. To kick off 
the partnership, Maxim hosted an on-campus event at BJTU where 
students were invited to learn about Maxim, our recruiting process, 
and benefits and development opportunities for employees. Many 
students from the Electronic and Information Engineering College 
attended and several interviewed for internship positions. Maxim 
entered into a similar partnership with one of the top schools in 
Dublin, Ireland (UCD). After just two years, Maxim has moved 
from being unknown to students, to a well-known semiconductor 
company in the area.

Recognizing our people
We want our people to share in our mutual success. 
We provide compensation, benefits, and long-term 
savings packages that are market competitive and 
that our employees value.
Maxim's U.S. 401(k) Plan helps employees save  
for their futures through a Company match, 
dollar-for-dollar for the first 3 percent of salary 
deferred and 50 percent match for the subsequent 
2 percentage points deferred. Employees can 
also choose to make pre-tax and after-tax Roth 
401(k) contributions. Maxim provides competitive 
retirement savings plans in nearly all of the countries 
in which we operate.
Recognizing the contributions our employees 
make to our company is a top priority. Managers 
can utilize several awards programs to recognize 
employees, including awards for exceptional 
performance, awards for successfully publishing technical papers or securing patents for new 
products, referral bonuses, and awards that 
recognize long term service to the company. 
We also launched our Peer-to-Peer recognition 
program, or “Maxim Inspire”  program in 2012 
because it is equally important to provide a 
mechanism for employees to recognize the 
outstanding achievements of their peers and 
to thank them for a job well done. Managers 
can award Maxim Inspire Points which may be 
redeemed for gift cards and other awards. Our 
employees can send e-cards to recognize their 
peers for going “above and beyond.” Feedback has 
been tremendously positive, and we’ve seen a high 
level of engagement with thousands of employees 
acknowledging the efforts of their global peers each 
year. The program may now also be accessed as a 
smartphone app, for employee nominations “on  
the go.”
Additional benefits
Maxim recognizes that, sometimes, our  
employees need flexibility to balance work and 
family obligations.
As of March 1, 2019, Maxim is implementing Paid 
Parental Leave  to allow eligible U.S. employees with 
up to 8 weeks of full or partial paid time off to bond 
with their child due to birth, adoption, or foster care 
event. This leave program is in addition to pregnancy 
and other unpaid leaves that have been previously 
available to Maxim’s employees.

Fostering a diverse and  
inclusive workplace
At Maxim, empowering design innovation means empowering diverse perspectives and 
ideas. As a company with customers around the world, it is beneficial for our business 
to foster a workforce that reflects the diversity of the markets we serve and embraces 
different backgrounds, viewpoints, skills and talents.
Maxim is committed to providing equality  
of opportunity for all, protecting the dignity  
of employees, and promoting respect for  
others at work. Our non-discrimination  
policy states that workers should not be 
discriminated against based on race, color, age, 
gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, 
religion, political affiliation, union membership, 
national origin, or marital status in hiring and 
employment practices. All employees are 
required to comply with these policies and not to 
participate in any acts of harassment based on 
these protected classes, retaliation for engaging 
in protected activity, or otherwise engage in 
inappropriate conduct. Employees are encouraged 
to report any incidents of discrimination, 
harassment, or retaliation for internal review  
and corrective action. Maxim is committed to 
responding and reviewing concerns that  
are received and taking corrective action,  
as appropriate.We are partnering with Stanford University's 
Clayman Institute for Gender Research to initiate 
certain pilot programs within Maxim, focusing on 
areas such as our talent search practice and our 
employee engagement programs. Maxim's Pledge 
for Respect and Fairness can be found on page 25 .
Given that 42% of our global workforce is 
female, Maxim is committed to encouraging and 
empowering the next generation of Maxim’s 
female leaders.

Maxim Pledge of Respect and Fairness
In matters of culture and our employees, we view 
laws prohibiting harassment and discrimination 
as minimum standards. At Maxim, we are 
not satisfied with minimum performance 
standards. We believe that respect for individuals 
is paramount, and we publicly declare our 
commitment to respect in our workplaces:
Diversity and Inclusion: We believe in the 
power of diverse perspectives and ideas at work. 
We know that having the very best employee 
population means actively seeking out people with 
different genders, races, cultures, religions and 
other backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives 
and then providing them opportunities for growth 
and advancement. We will take real steps to build 
a workplace where everyone feels welcome and all 
voices are heard. We will welcome feedback from 
employees about their workplace experience. We 
will not be satisfied with merely complying with 
laws prohibiting discrimination or harassment. 
Equal Pay: We are committed to the concept that 
all employees will be paid fairly and equitably. Not 
only in those jurisdictions where laws mandate 
fair pay, but globally, for all our employees, in all 
locations. We will do this by examining market pay 
and internal pay equity for all jobs and employees. 
This does not mean everyone in the same job 
receives the same pay. Differences in skills and 
abilities will often result in different pay. This does 
mean that we will perform annual reviews of our 
pay practices and, when necessary, adjust compensation levels to ensure our employees are 
paid fairly and equitably.
Harassment: We believe that respect for 
individuals is paramount. We believe that 
harassment and respect cannot co-exist. We are 
committed to promptly investigating harassment 
claims and, where it occurs, to taking corrective 
action to stop it. When we investigate a claim, we 
will treat all individuals with fairness and respect. 
Some forms of unprofessional conduct in the 
workplace may be remediated through additional 
training or coaching. Other forms of conduct, such 
as, harassment through sexual gestures, unwanted 
touching, or intimidation are not consistent 
with our values and will not be tolerated. When 
harassment is found, we will take immediate action 
to stop the conduct. We will not cover it up or seek 
confidentiality, but we will try to learn from it, to 
prevent recurrence, and to improve our workplace. 
We will not pay discretionary “settlement” 
compensation to individuals who engage in 
harassment upon their termination of employment 
by Maxim. 
Retaliation: We are committed to ensuring 
that anyone who raises a good faith concern 
will be protected from retaliation for doing 
so. We will affirmatively assess performance 
ratings and reviews for all individuals involved in 
investigations and reporting claims to make sure 
that all employment actions are objective and are 
independent of retaliatory action for the good  
faith reporting of concerns.FOSTERING A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE cont.

general employee awareness on inclusivity topics 
regarding diversity in innovation. Dr. Caroline 
Simard, Managing Director of the Stanford 
VMware Women's Leadership Innovation Lab, 
led one of the most popular talks this year on 
Womens’ Leadership in Technology and Science.
We also focus on promoting diversity at all levels 
of the Company. We currently have two female 
Board members. While we will always seek out 
the best available candidates, we will concentrate 
on nominating and retaining Board members 
who collectively reflect the best mix of skills, 
experience, knowledge and independence for 
effective decision-making and risk oversight, with 
an emphasis on identifying diverse candidates. 
Additionally, we are implementing a policy in 2019 requiring that for each executive hire (director and 
above), the applicant slate of qualified candidates 
must include at least one diverse candidate in 
race and/or gender. This builds upon our existing 
efforts to track and encourage gender diversity in 
candidate pools for new career hires and interns.
We are committed to gender pay equity and 
conduct regular pay equity reviews across our 
global operations to assess any potential pay 
equity issues. We are also committed to correcting 
pay equity issues, if identified. 
Maxim has created guidelines for the formation 
of Employee Resource Groups to foster inclusion 
and provide a platform for employees to connect, 
explore their unique passions and talents, innovate, 
and excel. One such example is our newly formed 
Women@Maxim  group. The mission of the 
Women@Maxim group is to enable employees to 
engage in personal development, peer mentoring, 
cross-functional collaboration, networking 
and social opportunities. Events include 
career development workshops, networking 
opportunities and a speaker series. 
We are proud of the progress we’ve made in this 
area but know we can do more. We continue to 
take practical steps to ensure we are living up to 
the commitments we’ve set for ourselves.
Another notable example of Maxim’s rich culture is our annual 
Diwali Event. The Hindu “festival of lights” is celebrated by 
millions across the world, regardless of faith, to rejoice in new 
beginnings and the victory of light over darkness, and good 
over evil. Employees at Maxim come together every year to 
celebrate Diwali in a grand style with food, cultural dancing 
and singing performances, and decorations. The 2018 Diwali 
celebration theme of “Many Lights, One Maxim” referenced 
one of our core values of “One Maxim,” representing oneness 
in employee community and highlighting Maxim’s diverse 
employee culture.
“One of the many wonderful things on which Maxim prides itself is creating a supportive and 
collaborative corporate culture where any individual contributing to this well-being is respected.  
Our value of One Maxim is the North Star for our peoples’ human and humane development.
Dino Anderson,  Executive Director of Learning, Development, Diversity & Inclusion

Health, safety & wellness
Maxim is committed to protecting our employees, contractors, and the public by 
integrating health and safety into all aspects of our business.
Our safety-minded culture is led by senior 
leadership, but all employees and contractors are 
empowered and expected to take responsibility  
for their own safety, the safety of those around 
them and to constantly promote a safe and healthy 
work environment.
We conduct frequent training and monitoring, 
covering applicable topics. Our employees receive 
Environmental Health and Safety New Hire 
Training and we maintain Emergency Response 
Teams at all our manufacturing and test centers.
We focus on prevention and strive for continuous 
improvement on all health and safety indicators 
as measured by standard industry metrics and 
established goals. In 2017, our OSHA Recordable Injury Rate was 0.18 while our Lost-Time Injury 
Rate was 0.04, making Maxim a leader in the 
semiconductor industry in terms of safety. Our 
average injury rates have been consistently lower 
than the U.S. manufacturing industry overall.  
We also know there’s a strong connection 
between an employee’s physical and mental 
well-being and his or her ability to work effectively. 
That is why we provide comprehensive healthcare 
benefits, free onsite wellness screenings for each 
employee and their spouse, and an employee 
assistance program. Learn more  about the health 
and wellness benefits we offer our employees.
In 2018, 24 Maxim locations participated in Global Walking 
Day, with approximately 2,012 individual employees joining the 
walk, double the participation rate in 2017. Employees walked 
4,500 miles that day and more than 400 of those employees 
signed on for the month-long Global Walking Challenge to 
improve their health. For four weeks, 426 Maxim employees 
attempted to hit their daily step goals and walk the distance of 
one lap around the globe. Not only did participants collectively 
walk the distance around the globe, but they circled it more 
than twice for a total of 51,702 miles, or 103,405,243 steps. 
This event not only inspires healthy habits, but it brings 
colleagues together around a shared, common goal.Global Walking Day

Giving back to communities
At Maxim, giving back to our communities is ingrained in the culture and values of our 
business. It is a common thread that unites and inspires us.
All Maxim operations have community 
engagement programs in place. Our established 
review processes help us efficiently select and 
fund charitable causes that align with the issues 
we are passionate about. Additionally, our 
internal Give.Care.Do. platform for employee-
specific or company-wide campaigns is an 
important communication tool to facilitate 
active engagement and support our employees 
in their efforts to identify volunteer or donation 
opportunities. Maxim frequently matches 
employee-based donations as well, in some cases 
as much as $100,000. 
The causes we support are myriad, but they all 
share a connection to our employees and the 
communities that surround us. They range 
from providing tutoring and mentorship to 
students through local elementary schools 
in the communities where we operate, or 
through science, technology, engineering, 
and math (STEM) education initiatives , from 
combating hunger through support of our local Food Banks, to supporting natural disaster 
relief efforts including the recent California 
wildfires, and many more.
In 2018 and 2017, we gave a total of $302,000 
and $317,000, respectively, to our community 
partners, a significant increase over the level 
of giving in 2016. This was due in part to the 
generosity of our employees who significantly 
increased their personal contributions as well.
Our company values making a 
difference for the betterment of the 
communities in which we operate.COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

Maxim goes    “into orbit” for  
FIRST LEGO‰ League robotics tournament
A topic close to our hearts is that of inspiring students to 
pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) 
education. We are proud to have supported robotics teams and 
competitions since 2012 through cash donations, volunteerism 
and in-kind donations.
In November 2018, Maxim hosted one of the FIRST LEGO 
League (FLL) Qualifying Tournaments in California where 
16 youth teams competed in multiple categories in hopes of 
advancing to the Regional Tournament, and eventually the World 
Championship. More than half of the event’s 50 volunteers were 
Maxim employees.
The FLL is an exciting, mentor-based STEM competition that 
helps kids ages 9 – 14 become innovative problem solvers for 
real-world issues. This year’s theme, “Into Orbit,” focused on 
space exploration. In the Robot Games—an action-packed 
segment of the tournament where teams complete as  
many “mission” challenges within a two-and-a-half-minute 
time limit—FLL teams designed, built, and programmed an 
autonomous robot using LEGO MINDSTORMS® technology. 
Seven teams were recognized for their outstanding tournament 
performance and received the following awards: Champions, 
Core Values, Project, Robot Design, Robot Performance, Judges’, 
and Global Innovation.

Combating hunger
For decades, our employees have given  
generously of their time and resources to Second 
Harvest. In 2017, more than 70 employees 
volunteered at the Second Harvest warehouse to 
sort and prepare food for distribution. Employees 
also competed in a 48-hour Virtual Race against 
other local companies to raise funds. We finished 
in the top three for all three competition categories 
(Total Giving, Giving Per Capita, and Participation), 
coming in a close second for Participation with 
38% of our employees giving to the cause.  
The Race to End Hunger in November 2018 was 
our best showing yet. Maxim came in at over 
$100K in employee donations, and more than 
50% of our local employees participated in a  
5K/1 Mile Race to End Hunger on the Maxim 
campus, race, up from 38% in 2017. This earned 
Maxim 1st place in Second Harvest’s Participation  
category—thus our logo will appear on the side of 
a food distribution truck for a full year.
For our efforts, Maxim was recognized by Second 
Harvest at their Make Hunger History Awards in 
three different categories in 2018—Brass Ring, 
Blue Diamond and Hunger Hero which specifically recognized the individual dedication of our CEO, 
Tunç Doluca, to hunger relief. We were honored to 
be recognized as allies in the fight against hunger 
in Silicon Valley.
Maxim has supported the Second Harvest Food Bank for over 25 years, 
whose mission is to ensure that anyone who needs a healthy meal can get 
one. In those 25 years we have donated over $1 million, an equivalent of  
2 million meals for families in need.
