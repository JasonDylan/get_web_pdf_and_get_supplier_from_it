CAN Aluminium is the material of choice  
for 90% of the world’s beverage cans.  
It preserves product quality, travels well, and can be recycled repeatedly without 
any loss in performance. Recycling 
aluminium requires about 5% of the energy needed to produce it from virgin materials, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 95%. We are an industry leader in the recycling 
of aluminium cans. With our plants  in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, U.S.  and Neuf-Brisach, France, we have the capacity to recycle the equivalent  of 23 billion cans a year , bringing us closer 
to our goal of ‘closing the loop’ in beverage can recycling.

IN OUTER  
SPACEOver the past 10 years, Airware® 2050 
joined Airware® 2195 as a preferred 
plate material for pressurized and non-pressurized structural components of space launchers and crew modules. Both alloys were selected by major space programs – SpaceX’s Falcon Launchers, NASA Orion Crew Modules, and Boeing’s Space Launch System. Globally, several other space launch entities are performing studies and building prototype launchers using Airware
® 2195 and 2050. Airware® 
started its history in space, replacing the 
legacy 2219 alloy, for cryogenic tankage of the Space Shuttle’s external tank. Responding to multiple challenging space launch requirements, Airware
® offers higher strength, 
enhanced damage tolerance, and corrosion resistance, as well as lower density. It allows for a dramatic increase in payload capacity and higher orbits.

How did Constellium  
perform in 2017? 
I am very pleased with the progress we made in 
ZmZXji^c\djghigViZ\n^c'%&,#DjggZhjaihgZÑZXiZYthe hard work of our entire team. Our Aerospace and Transportation and Automotive Structures and

The Automotive Structures and Industry business 
unit secured €1. 1 billion in automotive structures nominations – more than twice the current level of annual sales in this business, and the second consecutive year with more than €1. 1 billion in nominations. As for our Packaging and Automotive 
Rolled Products business unit, we continued to improve our operations at our Muscle Shoals plant, 
and we are ramping up our Auto Body Sheet lines in Bowling Green and Neuf-Brisach. Automotive rolled 
products shipments were up 52% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.
What do you predict  
for the automotive market?
This market is an important growth driver for 
8dchiZaa^jb! VcY lZ VgZ XdcÐYZci i]Vi ^cXgZVhZYaluminium use is a secular long-term trend. Demand for luxury cars, light trucks, and SUVs remains

aluminium-lithium technology and casting capacity, our response to the challenge of composites. Our innovative “fuselage of the future” is being used for the Bombardier C Series, and we are working on demonstrators for our “wing of the future. ” We believe there are more opportunities with aluminium than with other aerospace materials. Our industry continues to develop lighter alloys with higher strength and improved toughness and 
corrosion resistance. 
What is the status of other markets? 
The packaging market remains stable in North 
America, while a conversion from steel to aluminium is driving growth in Europe. We continue to expand into niche products and markets including transportation, industry, and defense. The North American transportation market is improving and in Europe demand for our extruded products remains strong in the industry segment.

However, we r ecognize that this is 
not enough to cover the whole value 
chain. This is why we became a 
founding member of the Aluminium 
Stewardship Initiative.
2.  CASTING, ROLLING,  
EXTRUSION, AND  COMPONENT FABRICATION
Casting: Other metals are added 
to the molten aluminium to create 
customized alloys, and then cast 
into billets or slabs.
Rolling:  Slabs are rolled to produce 
plates, sheets, or coils which  
are then used to produce cans,  
car hoods, or aircraft wings,  
for example.
Extrusion: Billets are  
transformed into extruded  products which can then  
be used in products such as  Crash Management Systems.
Components fabrication:  In some  
of our plants, we go beyond  
semi-fabrication and machining,  
and assemble complete components 
such as Crash Management 
Systems.
In our plants, we work hard  
to mitigate the potential impact  
of our operations.
3.  PRODUCT DESIGN

Aluminium can be endlessly recycled 
to deliver new products with the same 
properties as the original products.
There are three sources of recycled 
aluminium:
IYhWffheZkY[ZZkh_d]ekhfheY[ii[i
 Scrap produced during our customers’ 
processes
 Scrap recovered at the end  
of a product’s life
We recycle all of these categories,  
with a focus on end-of-life recycling. 
We believe we can further improve 
recycling through collaboration  
and partnership with all relevant 
stakeholders including customers, 
associations, and research centers.

successes regarding EHS progress  and performance in 2017?
In 2017 we focused on achieving EHS excellence 
through leadership, undertaking initiatives such as

The Road Ahead
Several factors are expected to continue 
driving an increased use of aluminium in automobiles. Aluminium’s favorable strength-to-weight ratio over steel allows 
automakers to lightw eight vehicles, leading 
to increased fuel efficiency, reduced CO
2 
emissions, and extended electric vehicle range. Aluminium has greater energy absorption leading to improved safety 
performance, and its thermal conductivity 
is an advantage for battery enclosures.
In North America, aluminium is forecast to 
grow at an 11% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) from 2017 to 2022. The products we make should also experience \gdli]^ci]Vii^bZ/h]ZZi[dgXadhjgZhand Body-in-White increasing from 37 lbs 
to 87 lbs (17 kg to 39 kg) per vehicle, and extruded products from 41 lbs to 49 lbs (19 kg to 23 kg) per vehicle. Greater demand for electric vehicles will push those numbers even higher; plug-in hybrid and full battery electric vehicles use 25-27% 
more aluminium than the typical internal combustion engine car.

In Europe, aluminium Auto Body Sheet 
(ABS) penetration is expected to rise in several applications including doors, hoods, fenders, and roofs. While European auto production is set to grow at a 2% CAGR from 2017 to 2022, ABS demand is expected to expand at a 12% CAGR.

What’s Brewing:  
Packaging Trends
Packaging is a stable market and resilient 
across economic cycles. Aluminium has become a preferred material for beverage packaging, and is replacing 
glass in certain markets such as beer. 
Aluminium allows drinks to chill faster, can be densely stacked for transportation and storage, is highly formable for differentiated branding, and offers the environmental advantage of easy, cost-Z[[ZXi^kZ!VcYZcZg\n"Z[ÐX^ZcigZXnXa^c\#  
In 2017 , aluminium beverage cans represented approximately 15% of flat rolled demand by volume in Europe, and 34% in the United States and Canada. 
Analysts at CRU estimate that global 
demand for aluminium for the canstock market will grow 3.4% per year until 2022.  In that time, the canstock market is expected 
to remain stable at 1.9 Mt in North America, where increasing consumption of beer and energy drinks makes up for a decrease in carbonated soft drinks, and segments such as water and tea also use cans.
In Europe, we see that aluminium is replacing 
steel as the standard for beverage cans; from 2002 to 2016, aluminium’s market penetration increased from 58% to 85%.

Stakeholders’ vision of Constellium
Overall, external stakeholders hold a 
positive image of Constellium’s performance – half recognized our sustainability engagement, while others mentioned our respect for the environment, recycling efforts, responsible purchasing practices, safety, and community involvement. A limited share (15%) suggested improvements in leadership, business relationships, or social engagement. Internal stakeholders were also mostly positive, though they asked for further engagement more often (30%). 
Key stakeholders’ expectations
Stakeholders most often cited the environment (energy, climate change, recycling) as an area where they expect Constellium’s strong commitment,  mentioning it 37% of the time. Internal and external communications were second in importance (23%), followed by governance (22%), and sustainable products (18%).By reaching out to our stakeholders, we can coordinate  
our actions with their concerns.
Conducting the Assessment
A Materiality Assessment allows us to know what topics matter most to our stakeholders, so that we can align our 
sustainability efforts with their priorities.

Roughly half came from France and Germany, 14% from North America, and 34% from the rest of the world.
Key priorities
As displayed on the next page, we were pleased to see that external and internal stakeholders’ views were well aligned.

LCA MODEL
Our model calculates  
the  environmental impact that comes from different life cycle phases of a given product or activity . It includes the impact of our own activity (energy use, waste production, air and water emissions, water consumption) and from other phases of our products’ life cycle: 
  Upstream (from bauxite mining  to metal production)
  Transportation of raw materials  and products to and from  Constellium sites
  Downstream (product end-of-life)
  EdiZci^VaWZcZÐih[gdbegdYjXiuse phase (e.g. savings in automotive applications) compared to reference material 
The tool allows us to collect and 
process data from product lines, sites, business units,  and  Constellium as a whole. It gives us a better understanding of our global footprint, considering that bdhid[djg^YZci^ÐZY environmental  impact occurs outside of Constellium’s activity – our internal activity generates less than 20% of the impact of our products throughout their lives. Establishing a full life cycle assessment of products is key  to determine if they are worth manufacturing, and if downstream WZcZÐihd[[hZiegdYjXi^dc^beVXi#
For instance, increasing our 
recycling activity boosts our internal emissions while decreasing our need for primary metal and upstream emissions. Similarly, developing stronger and lighter alloys may bring higher mass savings during product use at the cost of higher emissions during product manufacturing. This model is able to calculate environmental impact over a wide range of categories, such as climate change, water eutrophication, soil  VX^Y^ÐXVi^dc!VcY]jbVcidm^X^in#

Our industry works with our customers 
and recycling systems to increase the recycling of aluminium packaging, if[Y_ÑYWbboX[l[hW][YWdi$
Following its consolidation in November 
2017 , we know that in 2014 the overall 
recycling rate for aluminium beverage 
cans in Europe (EU 28 + EFTA) increased 
by 1.6% to a record level of 72.9%. 
Already, the level of aluminium packaging 
recycling is above the 2025 and 2030 targets in the European Union circular 
economy package. However, considering 
the disparity of recycling levels throughout 
Europe, we believe the aluminium beverage can recycling rate should and will continue  
to increase.Constellium works with European 
Aluminium to: •  Focus on out-of-home consumption to 
reach an 80% beverage can recycling rate by 2020.
•  Raise awareness about can recycling 
among consumers, particularly when cans are consumed away from home (at places of work, universities, concerts, sports and cultural events, hiking, etc.) through a unique, proactive can recycling program, “Every Can Counts. ”
•  Develop guidelines for post-consumer 
recycling of aluminium packaging waste.
•  In cooperation with canmakers and 
aluminium foil producers, promote the advantages of aluminium packaging items for cust omers, consumers,  
and future generations.
•  Provide learning tools for the next 
generation of design engineers and guide customers to use aluminium products  for optimized performance.
•  Share knowledge for European 
legislation, standards, and testing harmonization processes.
The U.S. recycling rate hit a dramatically 
low level at 49.4% in 2016. We recognize that our activity has been limited and propose to improve as follows: •  Engage in the U.S. recycling dialogue and 
highlight the beverage can’s value and role in the circular economy.
•  Evaluate expansion of deposits, and 
oppose repeal.
• Support actions to improve curbside recovery.AdWWn[dgaVcYÐaaWVch#2020  TARGETS

One of our initiatives is to improve waste data collection, including for recycled waste. At our Muscle Shoals site we precisely mapped our waste generation  in order to optimize its treatment.  In Ravenswood, the quantity of municipal waste decreased with a better waste segregation program. Each plant production unit is responsible for sorting and managing its own waste.

time and energy to conduct the assessments we require, so we organize training sessions and webinars to explain the process. Many of our suppliers have already undertaken assessments upon the request of another customer; this growing experience and awareness should make the situation easier for all.2020  TARGETS
X Evaluate the sustainability 
performance of all key  suppliers
XON TRACK
X Undertake on-site sustainability audits of suppliers working in locations and sectors with greater risk of divergent practices
XON TRACK
X Ensure that all contracted suppliers sign off on our Code of Conduct

Raw energy consumption per ton is not 
necessarily the most relevant indicator d[ZcZg\nZ[ÐX^ZcXn!WZXVjhZlZcZZYto take into account the effect of
