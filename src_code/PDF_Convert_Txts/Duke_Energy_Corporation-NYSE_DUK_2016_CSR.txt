2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 2 /About This Report
Duke Energy’s 11th Sustainability Report continues our tradition of disclosure and transparency 
about how we do business – and how we strive to benefit the communities we serve.
Anticipating changes in the industry drives us at Duke Energy. We are currently expanding renewable  
generation, transitioning from coal to natural gas, reducing our environmental footprint and modernizing  
our energy grid to support new technologies. We have public goals in this report to make sure we 
head down the right path – the one to a cleaner, more affordable and reliable energy future.
But just as important as our operational activities, is our engagement with stakeholders. They 
remind us that Duke Energy touches many areas of our society outside of delivering energy. There 
are many examples in this year’s report where partnering with others yielded notable results.
Sustainability is engrained at Duke Energy. We continue to fine-tune our business approach to 
take advantage of new technologies and improve innovation to make sure we exceed customer 
expectations. This goes hand-in-hand with our focus on the communities we serve, operational 
excellence, employee engagement and development.
There is one difference with this year’s report. In keeping pace with leading companies, we are 
producing it as a web-only document, with a PDF version available for printing. This will lower the report’s overall environmental impact. It may be a small change, but every little bit helps.
As always, you can find a detailed Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index on our website. The GRI is 
a recognized international framework for sustainability reporting. 
Enjoy our new report. Thank you for your interest in Duke Energy.

A Message From Our CEO
Providing safe, reliable and affordable power is at the heart of what we do. But thanks to changing 
social priorities, new technologies and alternative energy sources, customers have new and higher expectations of what they want from their energy provider. 
Today, how we make energy matters. People expect that we will produce and deliver power in ways 
that protect the environment and the communities we serve.  
Duke Energy has a clear, compelling strategy to deliver value to our stakeholders in this environment 
and our commitment to sustainability is woven throughout our approach. 
Maintaining Safe Operations
Our dedication to safety, operational and environmental excellence is unwavering. Any success  starts here. We improved on our industry-leading performance from 2015. We had no work- related fatalities last year and reduced our total incident case rate. Also, we reduced the number  
of significant injuries. That’s a record of performance to be proud of and I have our employees  
to thank.
Our employees improved our safety performance while meeting the energy needs of our customers. 
They did this despite demanding weather and a summertime usage record in the Carolinas.  
In 2016, our nuclear fleet increased its capacity factor to 95.7 percent. That’s a new record  
and the 18th consecutive year our capacity factor was above 90 percent.
This commitment to excellence also extends to environmental stewardship. Our reportable 
environmental events dropped by 17 percent in 2016. We increased our recycling efforts last year and remain on track to recycle 80 percent of our solid waste by 2018. We also made tremendous 
progress closing our coal ash basins. Last year, we excavated and stored over 5 million tons of 
coal ash in North Carolina. We also published basin closure plans across our service areas and announced two coal ash reprocessing locations, with one more to come. 
2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 4 /Modernizing Our Grid
Our energy grid, the largest in the United States, is a critical part of our nation’s infrastructure. 
We are investing $25 billion over 10 years to create a smarter, more modern grid that delivers the services our customers expect. Today, the grid stands as a one-way road. In the future, it must 
become a multilane highway, sending energy and information in both directions.  
Our investment will help us reduce outages and accelerate restoration, and allow customers to 
better manage their energy usage. It will also enable the system to support more renewable energy resources and emerging technologies such as battery storage. 
Duke Energy has a clear, compelling strategy to deliver value  
to our stakeholders in this environment and our commitment 
to sustainability is woven throughout our approach.
We have installed smart meters in the Midwest, have deployed the technology in the Carolinas and will start in Florida soon. So far, we have saved millions of dollars for customers by automating processes and reducing trips to start and stop service. Last year alone, we saved over 50 million 
outage minutes for customers, a twofold increase.
Generating Cleaner Energy
More and more, we’re generating cleaner energy. We have retired older coal units and invested in 
natural gas generation and renewables. And we continue to operate our carbon-free nuclear plants. Since 2005, our efforts have reduced our carbon dioxide emissions by 29 percent. 
And we are not finished. By 2030, we plan to reduce our carbon emissions by 40 percent from our 
2005 levels. We also plan to reduce our carbon intensity – the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per kilowatt-hour of energy produced – by 45 percent. 
We will meet these goals, in part, by investing $11 billion in natural gas and renewables over the 
next 10 years, as well as in the infrastructure necessary to supply our plants and customers with 
cleaner, low-cost fuel. 
These investments complement our expanding renewable portfolio. We have spent more than 
$5 billion over the past 10 years in commercial renewables. When combined with our regulated 
renewables, we’re one of the nation’s top five renewable energy companies. As of year-end 2016, 
we owned or had under contract over 5,400 megawatts of wind, solar and biomass energy. 
2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 5 /Focusing on Customers and Communities
The customer remains at the center of everything we do. We are updating our technology 
infrastructure to give our customers smarter, more advanced solutions. For example, they can  now receive proactive outage updates via voice, text or email as well as high bill alerts. 
Even as we transform Duke Energy, we continue to keep energy costs low. Last year, our electric 
rates were below the national average for customers in all six states we serve. We are also helping customers save energy. Our energy efficiency programs, from in-home energy reports to free LED bulbs, have played a part in reducing customer energy consumption by more than 12,000 gigawatt-hours as of year-end 2016.
We are committed to powering the lives of our customers and 
the vitality of our communities. That’s our purpose, and our 
focus on sustainability helps us keep this promise.
Our commitment extends beyond the services we provide. We are proud to be an economic engine for our communities we call home. Last year, we helped attract $4.1 billion in capital investment in our service territories. That led to the creation of over 14,000 jobs. We are also active through 
our philanthropic efforts. In 2016, Duke Energy and Piedmont’s total charitable giving was over 
$53 million. This included $33.5 million in direct giving by our Foundations, as well as company contributions and in-kind gifts, volunteer hours and contributions from employees and retirees to  our communities.
Our focus on the customer has led to improvements in customer satisfaction. Yet we have more to 
do. Our goal is simple: we want to move into the first quartile in the next five years. We have a plan 
to do that and maintain that position for years to come.
Today’s Duke Energy
We are committed to powering the lives of our customers and the vitality of our communities.  
That’s our purpose, and our focus on sustainability helps us keep this promise. 
Today’s Duke Energy is leading the way in a dynamic environment. How we are responding is 
delivering results and defining the future of our company and the communities we serve. This is  our path forward and we are charging ahead with confidence.
Sincerely,
Lynn J. Good 
Chairman, President and  Chief Executive Officer

2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 11 /Stakeholder Engagement and What Matters Most
The safety of our employees, customers and communities is our number  
one priority.
Stakeholder Engagement
Stakeholder engagement is a key to Duke Energy’s 
success, and a vital tool to help make our company an even stronger community partner. 
During 2016, we updated and expanded our 
stakeholder engagement tools and deployed them companywide. We also created an External Relations Council comprised of company leaders to improve coordination and alignment of stakeholder interactions 
at the national, state and local levels. 
A key challenge is our stakeholders often have 
divergent views. What is a high priority to some isn’t as important to others. 
But our experience shows that collaborating with 
stakeholders leads to better outcomes. No matter  how complex the issue, we aim for the right long- term balance that will strengthen trust and  confidence in our company and help us transition  
to cleaner, smarter energy solutions for our customers 
and communities.What Matters Most
Duke Energy’s approach to sustainability focuses on the issues that are most important to our stakeholders and to us. We identify issues from a variety of sources 
such as surveys, stakeholder feedback, thought leader 
perspectives, social and traditional media coverage, and shareholder proposals in our sector.
The graphic depicts the relationship among  
Duke Energy, its stakeholders and the most  
important issues as overlapping circles within 
circles to show that they are interconnected. The stakeholders and issues are both arranged alphabetically to make it clear that they are all important while safety, as always, is number one.

2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 16 /Working with Stakeholders on Future Generation Plans
In a unique partnership, Duke Energy is working closely with environmentalists, community leaders, 
business owners and government officials in Asheville, N.C., to produce an energy efficiency plan specifically designed to delay the need for a new electricity generating unit.
Duke Energy has committed to close a half-century-old, coal-fired power plant in Asheville in 2019 –  
and replace it with a cleaner, natural gas-fired power plant, consisting of two generating units.
The company also might need to build a third generating unit to meet the fast-growing region’s 
future electricity demand. But, in an unusual move, the company is seeking active community 
participation in energy efficiency programs to delay the need for the third generating unit.
“Many folks in Asheville and Buncombe County have said, ‘Give us a chance to demonstrate our 
ability to reduce energy use locally – with the goal of avoiding, or significantly delaying, construction of that third unit,’” says Jason Walls, Duke Energy’s government and community relations manager 
in Asheville.
Moving toward that goal, Duke Energy, Buncombe County and the city of Asheville created an 
Energy Innovation Task Force to develop a long-term energy plan for the region.
A key objective: encourage Duke Energy customers to reduce their electricity usage – especially 
during peak demand periods (extremely hot or cold days) – through the company’s many existing 
customer-focused energy efficiency programs. 
Those programs include free energy audits for homes, businesses and industrial plants to identify 
energy-saving opportunities; financial incentives to buy or construct energy-efficient homes and other buildings; and partial rebates for installing advanced, low-energy heating and cooling systems.
Duke Energy also can install a device that cycles a customer’s air conditioner or water heater on and 
off during peak demand periods, saving money for the customer (with little or no comfort impact) while reducing energy consumption on the electric grid.
The task force in 2017 will draft a detailed report on its initial, two-year energy savings proposal.
Says Walls: “This initiative is a national model for constructive and effective collaboration between  
a utility and the community it serves.”
In addition to energy efficiency programs, Duke Energy has committed to build at least  
15 megawatts of solar energy and 5 megawatts of energy storage in the region. Julie Mayfield  /  Asheville City Councilwoman     Joan Walker  /  MountainTrue Campaigns Director

Benefiting Customers
Duke Energy is rapidly upgrading and strengthening 
its largest-in-the-nation “electric grid” – the power lines, substations, meters and other equipment  
that help deliver electricity from power plants 
to customers.
The company is investing $25 billion in a 10-year 
grid modernization plan that will save energy, give customers more control over their electricity use, 
reduce power outages, accommodate additional solar 
energy, and lay the groundwork for energy storage and other new technologies.
The plan includes initiatives to “harden” the grid 
against extreme weather, such as hurricanes, by 
elevating substations in flood-prone areas, replacing and strengthening utility poles, and relocating vulnerable overhead power lines underground. 
Duke Energy is rapidly upgrading and 
strengthening its largest-in-the-nation “electric 
grid” – the power lines, substations, meters 
and other equipment that help deliver electricity from power plants to customers.
Additionally, we are working toward proactively 
predicting equipment failures before they happen so that equipment can be replaced, and unplanned 
outages avoided.
The plan also includes installation of advanced 
technologies that can better detect a power outage and pinpoint its cause, such as a damaged power line or equipment failure. Once problems are located on 
the power grid, these systems automatically trigger 
remote switches to immediately isolate the problem and reroute electricity around the trouble spot using other nearby power lines – greatly reducing the number of customers impacted.
2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 18 / CUSTOMERSThese technologies will also help Duke Energy provide 
more accurate power restoration time estimates to customers during outages. 
Another key part of the plan: digital “smart” meters 
that help customers save electricity and money.
Duke Energy replaced nearly all of its Ohio customers’ 
aging analog meters with the first generation of smart 
meters earlier this decade.
Similar meter replacement programs, now with 
even more advanced smart meters, are underway or planned for Duke Energy customers in Indiana, 
Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida, 
with targeted completion in all states by 2022.
Smart meters give customers easy online access to 
detailed information about their household electricity use – including daily and hourly consumption data – so  
they can adjust their usage to save energy and money. 
The meters also enable Duke Energy to:
   Remotely turn power on for new customers, 
eliminating the need for customers to wait for a Duke Energy technician to come to their home  
or business;
   Provide new payment options such as prepaid 
energy services and customized due dates.
  Smart meters give customers easy online 
access to detailed information about their

Our Customers
The “electric grid” – the equipment that delivers 
electricity from power plants to customers – is a critical part of America’s backbone infrastructure, vital 
to the nation’s security, economy and public health.
In the U.S., grid security is a shared responsibility of 
public-private partnerships that leverage the strengths of all parties. The electric utility industry has operated at a heightened state of security since the 2001 U.S. 
terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, working 
closely with multiple entities to safeguard the grid from intrusion, sabotage and attack – whether cyber, physical or both.
Those entities include the North American Electric 
Reliability Corporation, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of Energy, federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies, state and local law 
enforcement departments, and web security firms. 
Duke Energy uses comprehensive, multilayered 
cybersecurity measures to protect its computer systems, both software and hardware. The company’s highly skilled information technology specialists 
monitor the grid around the clock, searching for 
abnormal cyber activity and quickly responding to  any incident.
Also, Duke Energy is continuously strengthening the 
grid’s resiliency by installing multilayered, backup 
defense systems – so that if one section of the grid is interrupted, another section often can keep power flowing to customers.
To ensure it is doing all it can to be prepared,  
the company conducts simulated real-life drills  
and comprehensive employee training for any type  of emergency.

2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 19 / CUSTOMERSCrowdsourcing Helps Teachers  
Make a Difference
Duke Energy is partnering with DonorsChoose.org to 
help teachers in Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina and South Carolina fund projects that support literacy 
programs and foster a growing interest in science and 
technology fields.
The concept, helping teachers turn classroom projects 
into a reality, has been quite popular. Nationwide, teachers at 75 percent of public schools have used 
the concept – raising more than a half-billion dollars 
for education. Within Duke Energy’s service territories, thousands of projects have been completed with  our help.Here is how it works:
Teachers submit proposals for projects related to 
literacy or science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) on the DonorsChoose website. Once on the 
site, the public can read about each project and fund 
the ones they find interesting.
Up to a set limit that varies by state, Duke Energy will  
then match, dollar-for-dollar, all donations made toward  
eligible literacy and STEM projects at public schools in 
the company’s service area. Overall, Duke Energy will 
provide $475,000 in matching donations. 
The end result is that local teachers have the tools 
they need to teach and inspire our next generation of  
leaders. And the combination of public and Duke Energy  
support make sure needed projects are funded.2016 Charitable Giving

Saving money is important to customers. That’s why 
Duke Energy is continually working to help them use energy more efficiently.
The company offers programs in which trained energy 
experts inspect customers’ homes and share a tailored report on ways to save energy. Customers also receive a free energy efficiency starter kit to begin saving right away. In 2016, more than 54,000 homes received 
the free in-home energy assessment.  
Small to medium-sized business customers can also 
take control of energy spending by participating in a similar energy audit. They receive a comprehensive 
report detailing the findings and potential projects  
that would result in paybacks. Since 2013, over 31,000 energy audits have been performed on businesses, with nearly 13,000 customers participating in the program.
Another way Duke Energy has helped customers 
reduce energy consumption is through more energy-efficient lightbulbs. Since 2009, the company  has provided nearly 72 million energy-efficient lightbulbs through various programs, including free 
giveaways, its Online Savings Store, and through 
participating retailers. 
Since 2009, the company has provided nearly

Meter Recycling Helps People &  
the Environment
New smart meters are being installed throughout the 
Duke Energy service territories.
These new meters can collect the same data as the 
old ones, but unlike the old meters that were read once a month, smart meters relay data hourly, giving customers more insight into their energy usage than ever before.
Great innovation. But what happens to the old meters?
Nearly every day for the last several months, a 
team of employees at the 160,000-square-foot Goodwill Opportunity Campus in Charlotte has been 
dismantling old meters and parsing their pieces into 
recycling bins. Eventually, the work could grow to 1 million meters a year.Diverse Supplier Spending  (in millions)

environmentally sound and appreciated by those seeking employment. Plus, it advances the Goodwill 
mission of helping people reach their potential in  
the workplace.
The contract between Duke Energy and Goodwill 
began in June 2016 with the hiring of about a half-dozen employees, who now dismantle about 2,500 
meters a day. As Duke Energy’s upgrade expands, 
the workforce could grow to nine employees moving 4,500 meters a day, with a payroll that could eventually

Gaining employment and learning new skills are  
just a few of the positives this program provides  for employees.
The skills learned on the floor go beyond simple meter 
deconstructing. The employees must report on time, 
be productive and learn teamwork – skills that will 
make them attractive to future employers.
Satisfaction Scores Rise; Still Room  
for Improvement
While Duke Energy’s customer satisfaction scores 
improved for both business and residential segments in 2016, our rankings show there is still room for 
improvement.
All Duke Energy utilities are implementing plans to 
achieve top-quartile performance among large utilities in the J.D. Power Electric Utility Residential Study by the end of 2018.

GROWTH
2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 24 /Green Microgrids Could be a New Growth Initiative
Microgrids aren’t new. But Duke Energy’s efforts to power them with renewable energy have caught 
the attention of the industry.
In simple terms, a microgrid is an energy system consisting of distributed energy sources – like solar 
and batteries – that can operate in parallel with, or independently from, the main power grid. 
It promotes energy security – giving customers a reliable energy supply without the need of the full 
energy grid, or even fossil fuels.
For the past few years, Duke Energy engineer Tom Fenimore has been perfecting a research project 
in Charlotte that provides backup power to a city fire station. Using a solar array and a large battery system, the system supports the overall grid most of the time.
But when storms rolled through Charlotte this summer, the system provided power to the fire station 
twice – without any action by the company. The system was so fast that the fire station didn’t notice 
the microgrid was providing power.
Duke Energy’s work is leading to future projects. At Mount Sterling in the Great Smoky Mountains 
National Park in North Carolina, a proposed microgrid will provide 24-hour-a-day service to a communications tower.
In this case, the microgrid concept will be more reliable and less costly for the company than 
traditional poles and wires. In addition, about 13 acres of park land currently maintained as a utility corridor could be allowed to return to a natural state. 
In Maryland, Duke Energy Renewables and Schneider Electric will partner with Montgomery County 
to construct two microgrids for public safety facilities. The two systems, which will be owned by 
Duke Energy, will include solar and combined heat and power, which saves energy by using waste heat from on-site generation to heat and cool buildings. 
In Mount Holly, N.C., the company continues to research future microgrid developments – examining 
how the technology works in a future where distributed energy resources like solar and batteries are 
on nearby electrical circuits.
It’s part of the company’s innovation that may change how energy is delivered to customers in  
the future.Thomas Fenimore  /  Technology Development Manager
2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 25 / GROWTHDuke Energy Adding More Wind & Solar Resources 
Renewable energy technologies are advancing and prices are decreasing. Duke Energy is  
leveraging those advancements to expand its renewable energy portfolio and deliver cleaner  energy to its customers.
In total, the company has more than 20 wind projects and 60 solar facilities in operation in over a 
dozen states, totaling about 3,000 megawatts (MW) of generating capacity. 
For wind energy, the company completed two more projects last year – one in Texas and the other 
in Oklahoma. Duke Energy now harvests the wind in seven states. 
Solar continues to expand, too. In California, Duke Energy Renewables acquired three solar power 
plants totaling 55 MW in January 2017. In December 2016, Duke Energy Renewables also completed its 20-MW solar project in San Bernardino County, California. In addition, the company acquired its first solar projects in Colorado and Georgia and began operating its first solar facility in 
New Mexico during 2016.
The company acquired its first solar projects in Colorado and Georgia  
and began operating its first solar facility in New Mexico during 2016.
In our regulated states, the company continues to make strategic investments to benefit customers. 
In Indiana, construction is complete on the 17-MW solar facility at the Naval Support Activity Crane. The facility is helping power the military base and the surrounding community – similar to a project 
at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, which was completed in 2015.
In North Carolina, Duke Energy invested in 100 MW of solar capacity during the year – including 
plants in five counties that welcomed the jobs created during construction. Overall, Duke Energy has about 35 solar facilities in North Carolina, which represents the company’s top solar state. The company also purchased and connected around 500 MW of solar capacity for customers in 2016 
that was built by other developers.
In Florida, the company announced its 8.8-MW Suwannee Solar Facility in early 2017 and expects 
to break ground in the spring, with full operation by the end of 2017. Duke Energy already owns and operates solar projects in three other Florida counties, with plans for more in the future.
In South Carolina, the company’s solar rebate program paid nearly $12 million to customers last 
year. The rebates help with the upfront cost of installing solar panels, making the technology more accessible to customers.Commander Timothy Craddock  /  Commanding Officer, Naval Support Activity Crane     Mark Mullinix  /  Site Superintendent
2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 26 / GROWTHTomorrow: Investing in a Changing 
Energy Future
The electric and natural gas utility industry is 
undergoing rapid transformation as it pivots to meet rising customer service expectations, utilize the latest 
technological developments and produce energy in the 
most environmentally benign way available.
For Duke Energy, this transformative period presents a 
great opportunity to move forward in four key areas:
   Strengthen the company’s energy delivery system. Duke Energy has developed a 10-year, $25-billion plan to create a more modern, smarter energy grid. 
In this era of transformation, the demands on the 
grid have never been greater.
While the grid is reliable, recent events, such as Hurricane Matthew in North Carolina, have highlighted opportunities to strengthen it. (See 
related article on page 18: “A Smarter, Stronger 
Grid: Benefiting  Customers.”)
   Generate cleaner energy using natural gas and renewables.  In the next 10 years, Duke Energy 
will invest $11 billion in highly efficient natural 
gas generation and renewable energy sources. By 
2030, Duke Energy estimates that 36 percent of its electricity will be generated using natural gas and  9 percent will be generated using renewables – hydro, wind and solar.
These investments, coupled with the retirement of older coal units, will help reduce the company’s carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent from the 2005 level by 2030. In addition to commercial renewables, Duke Energy also will invest in regulated 
renewable assets. 
   Expand the company’s natural gas infrastructure 
to meet customer needs. Natural gas will continue to play a major role in the future generation needs of

Duke Energy now ranks second nationally for 
natural gas consumption across its electric utilities and local natural gas distribution companies.  (See related article on page 30: “Natural Gas: 
Moving to a Cleaner, Low-Carbon Future.”)
   Increase customer satisfaction and continue 
stakeholder engagement.  Over the next 10 years, 
Duke Energy will pursue a goal of achieving and 
sustaining top-quartile customer satisfaction by 
placing the customer at the center of everything the company does.
Duke Energy also will continue to work collaboratively with its various other stakeholders, 
including community leaders, environmental groups, 
business organizations, regulators, elected officials and investors. Such collaboration is critical to the company’s success.
  In the next 10 years, Duke Energy will 
invest $11 billion to increase highly efficient 
natural gas generation to 35 percent of the 
company’s electricity generation portfolio, and increase renewable energy sources – 
hydro, wind and solar – to 9 percent.Positioned to Deliver Sustainable 
Financial Results
In 2016, Duke Energy achieved adjusted diluted 
earnings per share of $4.69 compared to $4.54 for 2015. This increase was driven by continued 
investment in the company’s regulated utilities and 
infrastructure business, and a strong focus on reducing operations and maintenance costs across the business. 
One of Duke Energy’s primary goals as a sustainable 
company is delivering attractive long-term returns for 
its shareholders. 2017 will mark the 91st consecutive 
year we have paid a dividend to our shareholders. That dividend was increased by 4 percent in 2016. 
During 2016, the company completed its five-year 
portfolio transition with the sale of its Latin America 
business and acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. The company is now a predominately regulated, energy infrastructure business, well-positioned for growth in 2017 and beyond.
With the portfolio transition complete, the company 
realigned its business into three new segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, and Commercial Renewables.
These three businesses are well-situated to contribute 
adjusted diluted earnings per share that drive the company’s 4 to 6 percent overall growth objectives from 2017 to 2021.
Duke Energy’s total shareholder return – the 
change in stock price plus dividends – for 2016 
was 13.5 percent, compared to 17.4 percent for

Economic Development: Attracting  
Jobs, Investment
Duke Energy’s economic development team in 
2016 helped bring approximately 14,000 new jobs and $4.1 billion in private-sector investment 
to the six states served by the company’s electric 
utilities – benefiting workers, families and communities. Site Selection magazine named Duke Energy to its “Top Utilities in Economic 
Development” list for the 12th consecutive year.
The team recruits new companies from across the 
nation and around the world, convincing them to open offices, build manufacturing plants and locate other facilities in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, 
Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. The team also works 
with existing companies in those states, helping them expand at home rather than look elsewhere.
2016 highlights:
   In Ohio  and Kentucky , Duke Energy distributed 
$240,000 in grants to support urban 
redevelopment projects.
   In Indiana , Duke Energy awarded grants 
ranging from $2,500 to $7,500 to 12 economic development groups to attract jobs and businesses.

Natural Gas: Moving to a Cleaner,  
Low-Carbon Future 
Natural gas will play a key role as Duke Energy continues to move toward a cleaner, low-carbon future. 
The 2016 acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas added 
1 million natural gas customers in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee to Duke Energy’s existing customer base of 525,000 natural gas customers and 7.5 million electric customers. Piedmont’s Tennessee service territory, including the fast-growing Nashville 
region, represents a new geographical area for 
Duke Energy. Piedmont retained its name and now operates as a business unit of Duke Energy.
Two major underground interstate natural gas 
pipelines, partly owned by Duke Energy, also  
continue to move forward: 
   Construction of the Sabal Trail Pipeline – traversing Alabama, Georgia and Florida – began in 2016 following Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval. The 515-mile project is scheduled to open in 2017.
   FERC staff in 2016 issued a positive draft environmental impact statement for the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline, finding that the project can 
be built in an environmentally responsible way. 
The approximately 600-mile pipeline – from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina –  
is scheduled to open in 2019, pending final regulatory approval.
In addition, four natural gas-fired power plants are joining Duke Energy’s electricity generation fleet. The company acquired an existing plant in Polk County, Fla., in January 2017, and is building new plants in Anderson County, S.C. (opening in 2017); Citrus 
County, Fla. (opening in 2018); and Buncombe 
County, N.C. (opening in 2019). The three new plants are replacing older coal-fired plants.
The 2016 acquisition of Piedmont Natural 
Gas added 1 million natural gas customers in 
North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee 
to Duke Energy’s existing customer base of 525,000 natural gas customers and 7.5 million 
electric customers.

2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 30 / GROWTHLatin America Exit: Focusing on Core 
U.S. Operations
Duke Energy going forward is focused almost 
exclusively on its core U.S. operations.
The company in 2016 sold its international assets  
in Central America and South America in two  separate transactions. Selling these assets was an important transition in our goal to deliver more  predictable growth. 
The company’s highly stable U.S. regulated utilities 
in seven states – combined with its similarly stable renewable energy, electric transmission and natural gas businesses across the U.S. – now comprise almost all of the company’s operations.
Duke Energy sold its assets in Brazil to China  
Three Gorges Corp. Those assets consisted of  10 hydroelectric generation plants – eight plants totaling 2,057 megawatts (MW) on the border between Sao Paulo and Parana states; and two plants 
totaling 33 MW on the Sapucai Mirim River in  
Sao Paulo state.
Duke Energy sold its assets in Peru, Chile, Ecuador,

Duke Energy encourages full participation in our 
democracy in a variety of ways, including education and engagement efforts, policy advocacy and  
political activity.
Our Political Activity Policy  requires compliance with 
laws and regulations governing political contributions, 
government interaction and lobbying activities. It also includes guidelines and a tiered approval process 
that governs all political expenditures. Additionally, 
the company is legally prohibited from making direct contributions to candidates for U.S. federal offices  and certain state offices.
Duke Energy’s Voices in Politics network educates 
and activates employees on political and policy issues that could affect our operations, employees or stakeholders. We also engage elected officials and policymakers to make sure they understand the direct 
impacts of their decisions on Duke Energy and our 
employees, customers and communities.
In 2016, our reportable federal lobbying expenses 
(office space, salaries, consulting and event fees, etc.) included $1,265,149

2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 32 /Investing in Electric Vehicle Infrastructure 
For the past decade, Duke Energy has been active in building hundreds of public charging stations 
at parking decks, libraries and shopping areas. That infrastructure is needed as electric vehicles (EV) become a growing part of the nation’s auto fleet.
That effort will continue in 2017 as more than 200 public EV charging stations are being installed 
under Duke Energy’s $1.5 million “EV Charging Infrastructure Project” in North Carolina.
Stations are planned in almost 50 counties around the state. The project received overwhelming 
interest, with more than 500 charging stations requested.
Recipients have the ability to put the charging stations in a location of their choice – and operate 
them how they see fit.
More than 200 public EV charging stations are being installed under Duke Energy’s 
$1.5 million “EV Charging Infrastructure Project” in North Carolina.
Also part of the project, a $450,000 grant from Duke Energy will help Greensboro’s Department of Transportation install an electric charging station for a future influx of all-electric buses. The rapid-charging station can replenish a bus battery array in seven to 10 minutes.
The Greensboro Transportation Authority is transitioning its fleet of 47 diesel buses to all-electric 
vehicles. Over the next 10 years, the city plans to pair $4.5 million in voter-approved bonds with federal funds to replace diesel buses that have met or exceeded their useful life.
Electric buses have no tailpipe emissions and are up to four times as economical to operate as 
conventional buses. Greensboro could have its first two or three electric buses on the streets by 2018.
Both programs were part of a 2015 settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and 
various environmental groups.Davis Montgomery  /  Government and Community Relations Manager     Adam Fischer  /  Greensboro Department of Transportation Director
2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 33 / OPERATIONSDrones: From Testing to Real-Life Applications
A few years ago, Duke Energy was among a handful of utilities testing what unmanned aerial 
vehicles (better known as drones) could do for its business. 
Through the company’s Emerging Technology Office, Duke Energy looks at budding technologies 
that may be useful in three to 15 years. It investigates a number of possible scenarios to see if these new technologies can lower costs and allow us to work better and safer.
Many rounds of testing has led the company to believe drones have a future at Duke Energy. Today, 
drone work is being performed under the company’s Aviation Department, and is proving to be a 
valuable resource to Duke Energy’s renewable energy program – especially solar power.
Duke Energy looks at budding technologies that may be useful in three to 15 years. 
Carrying an infrared camera, drones can spot nonworking solar panels at the company’s facilities, 
eliminating time-consuming manual examination and leading to speedier repairs. 
About 20 Duke Energy employees are now certified to fly drones for the company, which is 
exploring additional uses for the devices. These include power line inspections, outage restoration and work inside and outside of large power plants.
Keeping up with technology is a challenge for any company. At Duke Energy, careful testing and 
investigation has the company on top of promising technologies. In the end, it is all about improving 
safety and operations, and lowering costs.

2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 34 / OPERATIONSProtecting Florida’s Precious Water Resources
Making better use of municipal reclaimed water – or treated wastewater – is a useful and popular 
sustainability success story.
A great example is Duke Energy’s Crystal River coal-fired units 4 and 5 on Florida’s Gulf Coast. The 
units receive between 750,000 and 800,000 gallons of treated wastewater a day from the city of Crystal River.
Instead of releasing reclaimed water over the city’s wastewater spray field, underground 
infrastructure transports the water to the power plant to support the energy generating process. 
   It reduces by nearly one-third the amount of fresh water drawn from existing wells to support the on-site pollution control equipment. 
   It eliminates wastewater discharges over the city’s spray field and reduces the amount of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, entering the Crystal River/Kings Bay springshed.
The project is a public-private partnership among the city of Crystal River, Duke Energy, Florida Department of Environmental Protection and Southwest Florida Water Management District.
During the next several years, as the city of Crystal River upgrades  
its sewer systems, Duke Energy expects to increase the amount of  
reclaimed water received to 1.5 million gallons a day.
During the next several years, as the city of Crystal River upgrades its sewer systems, Duke Energy expects to increase the amount of reclaimed water received to 1.5 million gallons a day.
In addition to Crystal River, three other Duke Energy plants in Florida – the Hines Energy Complex,

2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 35 / OPERATIONSIt’s All About Safety
At Duke Energy, the safety of our employees, 
contractors and communities is always our top priority. We strive for zero injuries but recognize that 
safety is more than a lack of incidents; it’s a culture 
where workers actively care about themselves and the well-being of others. 
In 2016, the company launched a five-year plan to 
focus on event-free operations and each business 
unit established new safety goals to build on previous 
successes. Our renewed focus led to important improvements in our safety performance. 
Duke Energy had zero work-related fatalities in 2016. 
Although we had one life-altering injury, we decreased 
significant injuries from 16 in 2015 to five in 2016, a two-thirds reduction. We also achieved an employee Total Incident Case Rate (TICR) of 0.40, one of the best in our industry.
We are pleased with our continued improvements, 
but know we still have work to do. In 2017, we plan to integrate Piedmont Natural Gas into Duke Energy’s safety processes and programs. We will also continue to focus on prevention of the most serious injuries to 
our employees and contractors to create an even safer 
place to work. Reaffirming Our Commitment Toward 
a Lower-Carbon Future
Providing safe, reliable and affordable energy has 
been at the heart of Duke Energy’s mission for more than 100 years. Duke Energy began by harnessing 
rivers to generate electric power. Today, we use 
a balanced energy mix including nuclear, natural gas, coal, wind and solar to power the lives of our customers. As we continue to modernize our system and deliver increasingly clean energy, reducing 
emissions cost-effectively remains an important tenet 
of our investment strategy.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue 
and a shared responsibility. For more than a decade, Duke Energy has been planning for an energy future 
that includes a constraint on carbon dioxide (CO
2) 
emissions to address climate change concerns. We 
established voluntary CO2 reduction goals in 2010 to 
benchmark our progress in reducing emissions. 
Through our modernization efforts and the retirement 
of older coal units, we have reduced fleetwide CO2 
emissions by 29 percent since 2005. 
Duke Energy has also reduced the CO2 intensity of our 
electric generating fleet by 25 percent since 2005, 
meaning we are producing more electricity with fewer 
CO2 emissions. 2013 2014 2015 2016

New Hydroelectric License to 
Benefit Region for Decades
Maintaining and enhancing the quality  
of the Carolinas’ lakes and rivers has been a Duke Energy tradition for more than  
a century.
In 2016, the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission issued a new 30 -year 
operating license for Duke Energy’s Keowee-Toxaway Hydroelectric Project, 
which allows the company to continue 
operating the Jocassee Pumped Storage Hydro Station, Keowee Hydro Station and associated lakes in North Carolina and South Carolina.
The project was originally licensed in 
1966 for 50 years. The new license includes conditions of a relicensing agreement signed by Duke Energy and 16 
other stakeholder organizations, following 
nearly a decade of collaboration. It allows the company to make enhancements to public recreational areas on Lake Jocassee and Lake Keowee. 
Proposals in the Recreation Management 
Plan include adding diver access, a new courtesy dock, a new boat and trailer docking area, access for nonmotorized boating, and bank fishing signs at Devil’s

Water Resources Fund Provides  
$5 Million for Waterways
Healthy waterways are vital to the communities  
Duke Energy serves. But we can’t do it alone.
Over the past two years, Duke Energy’s Water 
Resources Fund has helped fund 59 projects by organizations across the Carolinas and Virginia, providing support for the good work done by others.
The fund helps support projects that strengthen water 
quality, reinforce the importance of conservation, and 
expand public access to waterways for citizens and visitors across the region.
At the end of 2016, the fund had awarded more than 
$5 million – more than halfway to its $10 million 
multiyear commitment from Duke Energy. Recipients are selected by an independent body that includes five environmental experts and two Duke Energy employees. 
Among the allocations was a $15,000 grant to Clemson 
University in South Carolina to sponsor a graduate-
level course for K-12 teachers that explores the interrelationship of energy production, water and the environment. This course is taught by Clemson University faculty members, a S.C. Department of Natural 
Resources wildlife biologist and Duke Energy scientists.
Also, the Conservation Fund received $100,000 to 
protect critical acreage that contains the headwaters of the French Broad River in the Headwaters State Forest in North Carolina.Putting Rights of Way to Work  
for Wildlife
Duke Energy manages the land over which more than 
30,000 miles of transmission lines traverse – that’s more than enough to circle the globe.
With that much property to manage, the company has 
focused on how to put it to work for imperiled wildlife. Utility rights of way can serve as valuable corridors for threatened wildlife.
To bolster these efforts, the Duke Energy Foundation 
will provide $500,000 over the next five years to the National Wild Turkey Federation’s (NWTF) Energy for Wildlife program to conserve or enhance more than 6,000 acres of critical habitat across Florida, 
the Carolinas and Indiana. The project is designed 
to benefit imperiled pollinators and birds, as well as numerous other wildlife species.

transmission rights of way cross large areas of forested habitat. The enhanced habitat conditions will provide cover and a sustainable food source, while serving as a protective travel corridor for wildlife species that need it most. 
Beyond the new collaboration with NWTF,  
Duke Energy implemented many programs in 2016 with natural resource protection in mind. For instance, in Florida the company piloted a power line design that minimizes risks to birds. The redesigned elements 
will help prevent birds from getting in between lines 
and from perching and building nests on electrical lines and poles.
In North Carolina, the company is supporting the 
Carolina Raptor Center’s bald eagle conservation 
efforts, as well as the development of a new raptor trail and high-tech amphitheater to enhance educational programming for children.

Ash Solutions
Duke Energy is actively working to close 
its 60 coal ash basins to protect the environment, the public and the costs 
customers pay.
In 2016, the company announced it would 
excavate 34 basins and safely cap another 18 basins across its fleet. The company is  still finalizing details on the remaining sites.
Flexible ash basin closure options not only 
ensure Duke Energy can select the right closure options for each site, but also help keep costs lower for customers compared 
to a one-size-fits-all approach.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) recognizes that excavation or capping basins, combined with long-term monitoring, can be equally protective of the 
environment. The EPA also acknowledges 
that the vast majority of ash in the nation will be safely stored by capping basins  in place. Consistent with the industry,  
Duke Energy plans to safely dispose of 
almost 70 percent of its ash by capping  
in place.
Duke Energy is actively working to 
close its 60 coal ash basins to protect 
the environment, the public and the 
costs customers pay.
As part of the company’s ongoing 
commitment to its customers, it is closing older, less-efficient coal plants and ash 
basins, responsibly managing waste, and 
exploring new opportunities to expand the reuse of coal ash for beneficial purposes. 
Duke Energy currently recycles nearly 
two-thirds of all ash produced and 
has announced plans to install three 
reprocessing units to transform even  more of this material into useful products.Customers expect highly reliable electric service, and Duke Energy delivers  . Each 
year we set power delivery reliability targets for the number and duration of power 
outages, and generation fleet performance targets  .

2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 39 / OPERATIONSSince the 2014 Dan River coal ash release in North 
Carolina, Duke Energy has been mindful of any impact coal ash has on the environment and the community.
A two-year study conducted by N.C. State University 
along a 57-mile stretch of the Dan River showed no impacts of the coal ash release on agricultural crops in the area. The study joins a growing list of scientific data that demonstrate the river is doing well and 
wildlife is thriving. 
In addition, scientific data continue to show ash 
basins are not impacting neighbors’ wells or drinking water supplies near Duke Energy plant sites. This 
includes a Duke University study that confirmed 
hexavalent chromium is naturally occurring in drinking water wells across the region and is not originating from ash basins.
Nuclear Fleet Establishing New Records
Duke Energy has operated nuclear power plants since the early 1970s. And the company’s fleet keeps setting new records.
In 2016, Duke Energy’s 11 generating stations –  
at six sites in the Carolinas – set a new overall capacity factor of 95.72 percent. That marks the 18th consecutive year of attaining a 90-plus percent capacity factor. The plants produced 90 billion 
kilowatt-hours (kWh) of carbon-free electricity.Here are some of the highlights:
   The two-unit Brunswick Nuclear Plant generated 
a record of more than 15 billion kWh over the 12-month period. Brunswick also completed its 
shortest refueling outage ever.
   Catawba Nuclear Station Unit 1 set a 12-month 
record, cranking out more than 10 billion kWh of electricity, and Catawba Unit 2 had its longest 
continuous operating run.
   McGuire Nuclear Station’s two units established a 
station-best 12-month generation record of nearly 20 billion kWh.
   Oconee Nuclear Station Unit 2 provided a record of more than 7 billion kWh of electricity over the last 12 months, and units 1 and 3 completed their 
shortest refueling outages ever. Over the years,  
the efficiencies gained in planning and implementing  
shorter refueling outages have increased the fleet’s availability to produce electricity.
   Harris and Robinson nuclear plants each achieved record six-month generation during 2016 – producing more power over that time period  
than ever before.
As for constructing nuclear plants, the company 
received licenses from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for new reactors in South Carolina and Florida. No decisions have been made on proceeding 
with these projects.In 2016, Duke Energy’s 11 nuclear generating  stations – at six sites  
in the Carolinas – set a new overall capacity factor of 95 .72 percent .

dioxide (CO2) emissions decreased by  
29 percent, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions 
decreased by 94 percent and nitrogen oxides (NO
X) emissions decreased by 70 percent  . 
These decreases are primarily due to addition of pollution control equipment, decreased coal

2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 44 /Unity and Inclusion, Within and Beyond Our Walls
Duke Energy’s commitment to diversity and inclusion extends beyond our own walls and into the 
community. This commitment was more important than ever in 2016, as several of the communities we serve experienced tragic acts of violence and, in some cases, civil unrest.
In the wake of the civil unrest in Charlotte, N.C., in September, Duke Energy hosted a series of 
facilitated conversations, called “Pathways to Inclusion,” that provided a venue for employees to discuss these events, their impact, and how we can move forward and create unity. “The sessions gave employees a safe space for dialog around complex, emotional issues,” said LaTonya King,  Duke Energy’s director of diversity and inclusion. “They shared feelings of sadness, frustration  
and anger coming into the sessions, but they left feeling educated, enlightened, and hopeful.” 
The Duke Energy Foundation made a $100,000 donation to the Unite Charlotte Fund, a new 
community fund created in the aftermath of the unrest to support programs focused on healing, rebuilding trust and creating opportunities. 
The company brought in the NeuroLeadership Institute (NLI) to pilot a program  
on unconscious bias with 75 leaders across the company. Those who participated 
in the pilot reported they felt better equipped to not only recognize bias, but also 
overcome it in their day-to-day activities. 
Similarly, following the deadly shooting at an Orlando nightclub in June, the company made a $100,000 donation to the OneOrlando Fund to help respond to the community’s immediate and future needs. 
In 2016, we also continued our sharp focus on cultivating an inclusive environment in the 
workplace. For instance, the company brought in the NeuroLeadership Institute (NLI) to pilot a program on unconscious bias with 75 leaders across the company. Those who participated in the pilot reported they felt better equipped to not only recognize bias, but also overcome it in their day-to-day activities. 
“I’m excited about unconscious bias training. We expect to see improvements in the decision-making 
capabilities of our leaders as a result of this work,” says Melissa Anderson, executive vice president of administrative services and chief human resources officer. The unconscious bias training program will continue in 2017, with a focus on the top 400 leaders across the company.LaTonya King  /  Director, Diversity and Inclusion      Melissa Anderson  /  Executive Vice President, Administration and Chief Human Resources Officer     
2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 45 / EMPLOYEESDuke Engineer Builds Robots that Protect & Serve 
When robots are mentioned, it’s easy to conjure up memories of old science fiction movies. But do 
they have a place in today’s energy industry?
Kentucky employee Steve Hinkel is working on it. His innovative efforts teaching and designing robots  
have already caught the attention of local law enforcement and may have a future at Duke Energy. 
One of his recent creations is a rover robot for the Newport, Ky., Police Department, across the river 
from Cincinnati. Affectionately called SWAT-Bot by officers, the robot can help police access places that might be too risky or too cramped to enter, and can see things they may not ordinarily be able 
to detect.
“A technician might also direct a robot to make a repair in an energized electric 
substation; that way the person can stay in a completely safe zone.” 
Hinkel began dabbling in robotics several years ago when his young son showed an interest in 
robots. Over time, Hinkel became a quasi-expert in the design of robots – now teaching a class on robotics at Northern Kentucky University.
He continues to design new robots. And in addition to the Newport police squad, two other local 
police departments are adopting Hinkel’s robot designs.
As for Duke Energy, robots could be used to handle tasks that could be more dangerous than they 
first appear – like working in traffic.
“For example, instead of a crew member using a flag to direct traffic in highly congested areas, as 
when electrical workers are making repairs to a power line, a robot could do it,” said Hinkel. “A technician might also direct a robot to make a repair in an energized electric substation; that way the person can stay in a completely safe zone.”Detective Julie Marzheuser  /  Lead Negotiator, Edgewood PD and Kenton County Regional SWAT     Steve Hinkel  /  Director Advanced Technologies, Applications
2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 46 / EMPLOYEESHelping Employees Make an Impact in 
Their Communities 
When Duke Energy’s Jamie Lynton and his wife 
planted some milkweed in their yard that attracted a few butterflies, it gave him an idea. Why not do 
this on a larger scale to offer a protected habitat for 
imperiled monarch butterflies as they migrate south? 
He first organized a Duke Energy In Action 
Teams4Good volunteer event and rounded up co-workers to build the first monarch butterfly 
“waystation” at Lapping Park in Clarksville, Indiana. 
Lynton even helped Clarksville secure a $2,500 grant from the Duke Energy Foundation to pay for the plants and supplies.
A few months later, Clarksville Elementary School 
students returned to the waystation to release monarch butterflies and learn about their migration patterns and the dangers they face.
Teams4Good is part of the enhanced Duke Energy  
In Action program launched earlier in the year. 
Designed to empower employees and retirees  to make a difference in the communities where they live and work, the program makes it easy for employees to volunteer their time and double 
their charitable contributions to the causes they’re 
passionate about.
Other opportunities include Dollars4Good, which 
matches eligible donations made by employees; 
Hours4Good, through which employees can earn 
company grants when they volunteer their time; and Relief4Employees, which allows employees to support co-workers in need.The Duke Energy In Action program has been a hit in other areas of the Duke Energy territory. In Ohio, employees organized an Accounting for Kids Day to introduce financial literacy concepts to Cincinnati Public Schools students in a fun and interactive way. 
In North Carolina, employees at the Kings Mountain 
Generation Support Facility organized several volunteer events at the local Gateway Trail to  create and maintain a butterfly garden. 
Sharing a Ride; Lowering Our Impact
In 2015, Duke Energy spent almost $16 million  on rental cars and personal mileage for its 28,000 employees.
It led the company to ask, “Is there a better way?”
What resulted was RideShare – an innovative program 
that matches employees traveling to the same location. If two employees are both renting cars in 
North Carolina to travel from Raleigh to Asheville – 
RideShare allows them to connect and take one car instead. It’s a great way to meet fellow employees, lower costs and eliminate the need for additional cars on the highway.
Early results have been promising. Employees 
continue to sign up and test the program. In fact, in 2016, more than 45,000 highway miles were avoided by employees riding together. That number could be higher since many employees were informally sharing 
rides before the program was introduced.
As the effort continues to expand, Duke Energy will 
not only be able to save money on mileage and car rentals, but also lower its environmental impact with 
fewer vehicles and less emissions.

Each year, Duke Energy’s James B. Duke Award 
honors employees who have made an impact on their communities, neighbors and the industry. And there’s 
no bigger impact than saving a life.
Kentucky employees Denny Caple and Chris Thomas 
were leaving their truck when they were startled by the screech of a quick acceleration in the parking lot. When the Gas Operations employees looked over, 
they found the driver of the nearby truck slumped 
over, unresponsive. 
Caple and Thomas knew exactly what to do. 
They rushed to him and pulled the unresponsive 
construction worker from the vehicle. After a moment of consciousness, the victim passed out again.  
Co-workers Cliff Jeffery, Mike Highhouse and  Bill Stanforth, also witnessed the incident and  rushed to help as the construction worker went  
into cardiac arrest. As a team, the men performed CPR until paramedics 
arrived to take over the compressions and administer four shocks with an automated external defibrillator. 
At the hospital, the doctor said the construction 
worker’s artery was fully clogged, and, if not for the team’s quick action, he would have died. 
Throughout its many states, Duke Energy employees 
have accomplished a number of heroic acts – 
consistently going above and beyond to help others.

2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  / 49 / EMPLOYEESFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
Cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information
This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  . Forward-
looking statements are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and can often be identified by terms and phrases that include “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimate,” 
“expect,” “continue,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “plan,” “project,” “predict,” “will,” “potential,” 
“forecast,” “target,” “guidance,” “outlook” or other similar terminology  . Various factors may 
cause actual results to be materially different than the suggested outcomes within forward-
looking statements; accordingly, there is no assurance that such results will be realized  . 
These factors include, but are not limited to: state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives, including costs of compliance with existing and future environmental 
requirements or climate change, as well as rulings that affect cost and investment recovery or have an impact on rate structures or market prices; the extent and timing of costs and 
liabilities to comply with federal and state laws, regulations and legal requirements related to 
coal ash remediation, including amounts for required closure of certain ash impoundments, 
are uncertain and difficult to estimate; the ability to recover eligible costs, including amounts 
associated with coal ash impoundment retirement obligations and costs related to significant 
weather events, and to earn an adequate return on investment through the regulatory 
process; the costs of decommissioning Crystal River Unit 3 and other nuclear facilities could prove to be more extensive than amounts estimated and all costs may not be fully recoverable 
through the regulatory process; credit ratings of the company or its subsidiaries may be 
different from what is expected; costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings, 
settlements, investigations and claims; industrial, commercial and residential growth or 
decline in service territories or customer bases resulting from variations in customer usage 
patterns, including energy efficiency efforts and use of alternative energy sources, including 
self-generation and distributed generation technologies; federal and state regulations, laws and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of energy efficiency measures 
and distributed generation technologies, such as rooftop solar and battery storage, in our 
service territories could result in customers leaving the electric distribution system, excess 
generation resources as well as stranded costs; advancements in technology; additional 
competition in electric and gas markets and continued industry consolidation; the influence of weather and other natural phenomena on operations, including the economic, operational 
and other effects of severe storms, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes and tornadoes, 
including extreme weather associated with climate change; the ability to successfully 
operate electric generating facilities and deliver electricity to customers including direct or 
indirect effects to the company resulting from an incident that affects the U  .S . electric grid 
or generating resources; the ability to complete necessary or desirable pipeline expansion or infrastructure projects in our natural gas business; operational interruptions to our gas distribution and transmission activities; the availability of adequate interstate pipeline 
transportation capacity and natural gas supply; the impact on facilities and business from a terrorist attack, cybersecurity threats, data security breaches, and other catastrophic 
events such as fires, explosions, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences; the 
inherent risks associated with the operation and potential construction of nuclear facilities, 
including environmental, health, safety, regulatory and financial risks; the timing and extent 
of changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and the 
ability to recover such costs through the regulatory process, where appropriate, and their impact on liquidity positions and the value of underlying assets; the results of financing 
efforts, including the ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, which can be affected 
by various factors, including credit ratings, interest rate fluctuations and general economic 
conditions; the credit ratings may be different from what the company and its subsidiaries 
expect; declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities and resultant cash funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, other post-retirement benefit 
plans, and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; construction and development risks 
associated with the completion of Duke Energy and its subsidiaries’ capital investment 
projects, including risks related to financing, obtaining and complying with terms of permits, 
meeting construction budgets and schedules, and satisfying operating and environmental 
performance standards, as well as the ability to recover costs from customers in a timely 
manner or at all; changes in rules for regional transmission organizations, including changes in rate designs and new and evolving capacity markets, and risks related to obligations 
created by the default of other participants; the ability to control operation and maintenance 
costs; the level of creditworthiness of counterparties to transactions; employee workforce 
factors, including the potential inability to attract and retain key personnel; the ability of 
subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions to Duke Energy Corporation holding company 
(the Parent); the performance of projects undertaken by our nonregulated businesses and 
the success of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities; the effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by accounting standard-setting bodies; substantial 
revision to the U  .S . tax code, such as changes to the corporate tax rate or a material change 
in the deductibility of interest; the impact of potential goodwill impairments; the ability to successfully complete future merger, acquisition or divestiture plans; and the ability to 
successfully integrate the natural gas businesses following the acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc  . and realize anticipated benefits  .
Additional risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed in Duke Energy’s and its 
subsidiaries’ reports filed with the SEC and available at the SEC’s website at www  .sec .gov .  
In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time 
than described  . Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made;

looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise  .
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”)
Management evaluates financial performance in part based on adjusted diluted EPS, a 
non-GAAP financial measure .  Adjusted diluted EPS represents diluted EPS from continuing 
operations attributable to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders, adjusted for the per-share impact of special items  . As discussed below, special items include certain 
charges and credits which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy’s ongoing performance  . Management believes the presentation of adjusted diluted EPS provides useful 
information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of  
Duke Energy’s performance across periods  .
Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for planning and forecasting, and 
for reporting financial results to the Duke Energy Board of Directors (Board of Directors), 
employees, stockholders, analysts and investors  . Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a  
basis for employee incentive bonuses  . The most directly comparable GAAP measures for 
adjusted diluted EPS is reported diluted EPS attributable to Duke Energy Corporation  common stockholders  .
Special items included in the periods presented include the following items which 
management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:
•   Costs to Achieve Mergers represents charges that result from potential or completed 
strategic acquisitions  . 
•   Cost Savings Initiatives represents severance charges related to company-wide initiatives 
to standardize processes and systems, leverage technology and workforce optimization  . 
•   Commercial Renewables Impairment and Asset Impairment represent other-than-
temporary impairments  .
•   Edwardsport Settlement, Ash Basin Settlement and Penalties, and Coal Ash Plea Agreements Reserve represent charges related to Plea Agreements and settlement 
agreements with regulators and other governmental entities  .
Adjusted diluted EPS also includes the operating results of the nonregulated Midwest 
generation business and Duke Energy Retail Sales (collectively, the Midwest Generation Disposal Group) and the International Disposal Group, which have been classified as discontinued operations  . Management believes inclusion of the operating results of the 
disposal groups within adjusted diluted EPS results in a better reflection of Duke Energy’s 
financial performance during the period  .
Duke Energy’s adjusted diluted EPS may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure  
of another company because other companies may not calculate the measure in the  
same manner  .
The following table presents a reconciliation of reported diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS  .

Adjusted Diluted EPS Outlook
Duke Energy’s 2016 Sustainability Report references the five-year, long-term range of annual 
growth of 4 to 6 percent in adjusted diluted EPS (on a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) 
basis)  . Due to the forward-looking nature of this non-GAAP financial measure for future periods, information to reconcile it to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure 
is not available at this time, as management is unable to project all special items for future 
periods, such as legal settlements, the impact of regulatory orders or asset impairments  .
