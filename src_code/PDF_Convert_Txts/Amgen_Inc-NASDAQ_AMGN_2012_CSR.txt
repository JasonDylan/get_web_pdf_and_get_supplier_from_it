Robert A. Bradway  
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Leadership Message
As we deliver more therapies to more patients suffering 
from serious illnesses around the world, it remains 
critical that we do so in a way that is consistent with 
our mission and our values. 
Over the past 33 years, we have grown to be a leader in 
biotechnology and we have reached more than 25 million 
patients. During the course of that journey, innovation 
has played a pivotal role. As a company, we have innovated 
by discovering and developing medicines that have 
dramatically improved people’s lives. In addition, we 
have played a pioneering role in biologics manufacturing 
through scores of innovations that have enabled us to 
deliver vital medicines to large patient populations. 
We expect to continue transforming our manufacturing 
process in the years ahead. An important part of that next 
wave of manufacturing innovation will involve reducing 
waste while improving efficiencies and incorporating 
greater flexibility into the process. As we embark on 
this exciting new chapter in our company’s history, 
our commitment to operating in a way that reduces 
environmental impacts remains steadfast. 
We achieved the targets that we set in 2008 as part of 
our first environmental sustainability plan. From 2008 
through 2012, we realized more than $24 million in 
cost savings by implementing strategic sustainability 
initiatives. And we made those conservation gains even 
as we grew operations worldwide.
As part of our sustainability initiatives, our staff eliminated 
waste and created efficiencies through our Green Chemistry 
and Green Biology programs. We remodeled facilities for 
expansion with green features, and in 2012, we achieved a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) 
Gold designation for an Amgen building. Our initial 
integration of environmental sustainability principles into 
our products and processes will form the foundation of 
our second environmental sustainability plan, beginning 
in 2013, which will take us through 2020.
I view the state-of-the-art manufacturing facility we are 
planning in Singapore as the best example to date of how 
our growth intersects with our environmental sustainability 
goals. This innovative, new facility is expected to conserve 
resources and save costs, thereby contributing to the 
consistent supply of safe and effective medicines to 
patients who need them.
Staff members, who are passionate about our mission, 
represent our most important resource. Creating a supportive 
work environment that keeps them safe and well is a 
primary part of our culture. We have a comprehensive 
and effective set of wellness programs for staff as well 
as one of the best safety records in our industry.
Thank you for following our progress as we continue 
to reduce environmental impacts, improve efficiencies, 
and decrease costs. These sustainability achievements 
exemplify how science and innovation applied across 
Amgen support our aspiration to dramatically improve 
patients’ lives.Robert A. Bradway3
In 2008, we set six environmental targets: energy, carbon dioxide, water, waste recycling, waste reduction, and the 
fuel efficiency of our US sales fleet—all of which we’ve achieved. We saved more than $24 million in costs from 
2008 to 2012 as a result of striving toward those targets and achieving efficiency gains. For 2020, we have set new 
targets in the areas of facility carbon emissions, fleet carbon emissions, and disposed waste reduction, emphasizing 
a continued focus on reducing greenhouse gases as well as the amount of waste we dispose.Our Targets

From developing molecules to installing building technologies, we’re integrating environmental 
sustainability into many core areas of Amgen’s business. We share our environmental ethic through 
volunteering in our communities worldwide.
Building Renovation Earns LEED Gold
In 2012, Amgen earned LEED (Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design) Gold for the renovation of an 
administrative building at our Thousand Oaks, California, 
campus. The building is designed to provide energy and 
water conservation benefits exceeding current industry 
baseline standards. Additionally, the building incorporates 
abundant natural light, state-of-the-art technology, and 
flexible work areas and meeting spaces to facilitate the 
way people work today. This renovation, a pilot project, 
has set an example for all of Amgen’s office space 
construction for 2012 and beyond.
Innovations Reduce Carbon Footprint of Manufacturing
Facilities to load drug product into vials and syringes 
traditionally consume large amounts of energy, but at 
our new manufacturing building in Puerto Rico, updated 
technologies have reduced energy use by 25 percent 
and fuel requirements by 40 percent over traditional 
methods. That facility design eliminated 8,730 metric 
tons of carbon dioxide in 2012, thereby helping us 
achieve our carbon target in 2012. Energy-efficient 
lighting as well as equipment that uses less water adds 
to the conservation benefits of that new construction.
Better Processes through 
Greener Biology and Chemistry 
As part of a green biology emphasis, Amgen is beginning 
to switch to advanced chromatography methods that lead 
to energy and water conservation, waste reduction, and 
reduced solvent use. Amgen is including sustainability considerations in the annual review of our monoclonal 
antibody platform and is participating in industry-wide 
efforts to measure the environmental footprint of large-
molecule manufacturing. 
Our small-molecule and medicinal chemistry teams are 
demonstrating the direct relationship between process 
cost reduction and green chemistry practices. These 
conservation results are good for the environment, and 
they deliver enhanced process efficiency and added 
value for our stakeholders. We have advanced our use of 
solvent-selection tools, integrating them into our Small 
Molecule Process & Product Development electronic 
notebook. Amgen is very active in several prominent 
green chemistry industry organizations.
Greener Packaging
We’re making steady progress toward more-environmentally-
friendly approaches in the delivery, packaging, and end 
of use of our medicines. Our Sharps Mail-Back program 
for patients using Enbrel® (etanercept) grew in the first full 
year of the program, keeping approximately 17 metric 
tons of sharps medical waste from landfills per quarter. 
In 2012, we approved the use of paperboard from 
certified-sustainable forests in our clinical and commercial 
secondary packaging. Using our Green Packaging 
Assessment Process, we are evaluating the sustainable 
qualities of new secondary packaging materials. Our 
program to expand the printing of recycling logos on 
secondary packaging also expanded in 2012.Left: We renovated a 
building in Thousand 
Oaks, California, that

techniques with enhanced 
collaboration approaches.

Volunteering for the Environment 
Collecting, hauling, and planting as they go, Amgen 
staff around the world are protecting and restoring the 
environment in their communities. From British Columbia 
to Puerto Rico, hundreds of Amgen staff members 
cleared nearly 4 metric tons of debris from beaches and 
waterways as part of the September 2012 International 
Coastal Cleanup. In 2012, Amgen was awarded the 
Boulder County, Colorado, Parks and Open Space 
Partnership Award for conservation activities at Pella 
Crossing, a wetland conservation park and other 
open-space lands. Since 2009, Amgen has contributed 
close to 600 hours of volunteer service each year in 
helping care for these lands. 
Community plant restoration events grow year by year at 
Amgen. Staff members from Thousand Oaks, California, 
have made numerous treks to Anacapa Island in California’s 
Channel Islands to remove nonnative, invasive ice 
plant—vegetation that has been overwhelming native 
plant species and inhibiting the food sources of native 
wildlife since it was introduced in the 1940s. Staff also 
replant cleared areas with native plants grown from 
island-collected seed. In Australia, staff members planted 
300 native seedlings in an area of bush close to Amgen’s 
Sydney office. The group helped transform an area 
previously overrun with weeds into an area that will 
encourage native birds and insects.The Amgen Foundation Supports the Environment
The Amgen Foundation placed special emphasis on water 
through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation’s Five 
Star Restoration Program beginning in 2012. Through 
this program, the Amgen Foundation will provide financial 
assistance on a competitive basis for community-based 
wetland, riparian, and coastal habitat restoration projects. 
Additionally in 2012, the Amgen Foundation continued 
its long-standing support of NatureBridge: Science in 
the Outdoors, enabling students to visit the program’s 
residential program for several days at a time. The 
Foundation also continued support of the National 
Wildlife Federation’s Eco-Schools USA program in 
Ventura County, California. 
Two of the Foundation’s 10 honorees for Excellence in 
Volunteering are involved in environmental conservation. 
One honoree, a water-sports enthusiast, volunteers with 
the Scuba Dogs Society in Puerto Rico to remove tons 
of waste from coastal areas of the island every year. 
Another was singled out for her volunteer work at the 
Seattle Aquarium, which began when she was a teen 
naturalist in 1994. 
See the Amgen Foundation 2012 Charitable Contributions 
Report for more information on the wide variety of 
nonprofits the Foundation supports in communities 
across the United States, Puerto Rico, and Europe.Amgen makes an impact in the communities in which we operate through direct volunteer work by staff 
members and through financial support from the Amgen Foundation. We are a good neighbor in the 
communities where we work and live.

Carbon DioxideConserving Resources
Energy conservation has a direct impact on the amount of carbon 
dioxide (CO
2) we emit through operations. We started our sustainability 
approach by tackling large projects that provided big returns for both 
energy savings and carbon reduction across our network of facilities 
around the world. Most recently, we’ve looked at new technologies 
for product manufacturing that provide energy and carbon reduction 
benefits. Energy conservation and carbon reduction projects have 
saved our Company close to $17 million annually and reduced carbon 
emissions by 83,000 metric tons since 2008.
Our improvement target for the fuel efficiency of our US sales fleet, 
which we met in 2012, has driven our approach to fleet management 
over the years. We’ve steadily expanded fuel-efficient vehicle choices 
available for mobile staff, rotating less-fuel-efficient vehicles out of the 
fleet for more-efficient options that achieve 23 miles per gallon or higher.

Reducing Waste, Saving Water
We diverted more than 26,500 metric tons of waste and improved 
our overall recycling rate from 38 percent to 59 percent from 2007 
through 2012 through staff commitment to recycling and waste 
reduction programs. We identified a multitude of ways to recycle, 
including composting landscape, food, and disposable food-service 
waste, and reusing equipment and office supplies on-site. With this 
success as a foundation, we shifted to the practice of reducing the 
waste at its source.
Amgen continuously strives to conserve water, which is a vital 
component of our medicines. Water conservation solutions we’ve 
implemented include a wastewater treatment plant in Puerto Rico 
that has enabled an average of 70 percent of the treated wastewater 
generated at the facility to be recycled on-site each year, and low-water 
landscaping and smart-irrigation controls at a variety of facilities.Water Intake Water Intake Avoided* through Conservation Efforts3,000

Amgen’s 2020 Plan
In 2013, we begin executing against a new sustainability 
plan that will take us through 2020. This plan now covers 
Amgen’s entire value chain, allowing us to gain a better 
understanding of our supplier impact, as well as to 
increase the integration of sustainability into our products 
and processes. Building on our culture of environmental 
sustainability, we will continue driving sustainable practices 
in the areas of Research and Development, Manufacturing 
and Operations, Transportation and Distribution, Commercial 
Operations, Sourcing, and Product Stewardship.
Whereas our 2012 plan focused sharply on implementing 
conservation projects to increase efficiencies in our existing 
facilities, our 2020 plan will achieve results from designing 
in sustainability during process and product development. 
By making sustainability part of the design process, we will 
achieve further efficiencies in our business while continuing 
to reduce our impact on the environment. 
As part of our plan, we have committed to achieving 
new targets: 
•	 Reduce	facility	carbon	emissions	by	10	percent 	
•	 Reduce	fleet	carbon	emissions	by	20	percent 	
•	 Reduce	disposed	waste	by	35	percent 	We will work to better understand the local water issues 
and conditions at our facilities, after which we will set a 
water reduction target. 
We realize that staff innovation drives our progress in 
environmental sustainability. Our focus is on building an 
even stronger culture where staff innovation is encouraged 
and recognition given for contributions toward reducing 
Amgen’s environmental impact. Staff can have a positive 
impact in many areas including Green Chemistry, Green 
Biology, and Green Packaging. 
Staff will be particularly engaged in digging more deeply 
to find further opportunities across our entire value chain 
to innovate our processes to increase efficiency and 
reduce wasted resources. By broadening our plan to 
cover our value chain, we will be better able to understand 
the impact of our suppliers and work to improve our 
partnership and reduce risk. By furthering our reach 
across our value chain we will begin to have a greater 
impact not only on our own products and processes, 
but those of our suppliers as well. 
Our 2020 sustainability plan is designed to strengthen 
our business and contribute to our mission to serve 
patients by creating efficiencies, saving resources, and 
reducing risk.

candidates for state and local elected offices are permissible in accordance with applicable laws and Amgen policy. Outside the US, the rules governing corporate contributions to 
political parties and/or organizations vary by country. Amgen complies with all applicable laws and regulations in countries in which it has or intends to have a corporate presence 
or does business. Amgen adheres to a corporate policy that requires internal legal review before any contribution is made. Amgen considers making such contributions, where they 
are legally permissible, if the funds will be used to support education and engagement on science, technology, and innovation issues. Additional information may be found in the 
Corporate Governance section at www.amgen.com.Summary of Data — Notes
(a)Amgen has included data from 15 facilities covering energy and carbon, water, and waste. The facilities represent approximately 95 percent of Amgen’s worldwide facility space based on 
total square feet. Included facilities are in Thousand Oaks, California, US; Greenwich, Rhode Island, US; Boulder and Longmont, Colorado, US; Seattle and Bothell, Washington, US; Juncos, 
Puerto Rico, US; Louisville, Kentucky, US; South San Francisco, California, US; Cambridge and Woburn, Massachusetts, US; Burnaby, Canada; Breda, Netherlands; Dun Laoghaire, Ireland; 
and Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge, United Kingdom. This includes leased buildings where we have operational control over building infrastructure, including utilities. In 2011, Amgen 
divested of its Fremont, California, facility and acquired facilities in Dun Laoghaire, Woburn, and São Paulo. In 2012, Amgen acquired four companies: Micromet, KAI Pharmaceuticals, 
deCODE genetics, and Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals. In our 2012 report, data beginning in May 2011 through the end of 2012 will be included from our Dun Laoghaire facility, which 
we purchased in May 2011. Data will be included from our Woburn and Abingdon facilities beginning in March 2011 through the end of 2012. No data will be included for our São Paulo 
facility or for Micromet, KAI Pharmaceuticals, deCODE genetics, or Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals in this report, as we are still working through the integration process for these facilities.
(b)Measurement and verification of conservation and reduction projects for energy and carbon dioxide, water, and waste are based on adaptation of the International Performance 
Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), Concepts and Options for Determining Energy and Water Savings Volume 1, EVO 10000-1.2007, April 2007. Project measurements 
are conducted using reasonable means, including direct measurements and scientific estimations as appropriate.
(c) Small changes to 2007–11 data have occurred due to refinements in calculations. All changes have been confirmed through a documented change control process.
(d)Direct energy use results from the operation of equipment that is owned or controlled by Amgen at the facilities listed in note (a). Data on the use of natural gas, propane, and diesel in 
boilers, furnaces, and HVAC are recorded from utility bills or purchase records. Data on the use of diesel in emergency generators are recorded from purchase records or meter readings 
and, in some cases, estimated from run-hours. Utility bills recorded in units of volume are converted to energy by using the Global Reporting Initiative Version 3.0, EN3 table, to convert 
volumes of primary sources (natural gas, diesel), or from specific fuel analysis data (diesel used in Juncos, Puerto Rico), and the US Energy Information Administration/Annual Energy 
Review Table A1 (propane). Energy from emergency generators recorded as run-hours is estimated using the manufacturer’s specified fuel-feed rate for each generator.
(e)Indirect energy use results from purchased energy in the forms of electricity and steam at the Amgen facilities listed in note (a). Data on the use of electricity and steam are recorded 
from utility bills. Utility bills for purchased steam that are recorded in units of mass (i.e., ‘lb steam’) are converted to energy by using the latent heat of evaporation from the saturated 
steam tables, then dividing by the efficiency of the supplier’s steam generator.
(f)Scope 1 carbon emissions result from direct energy sources defined in note (c). Carbon emissions from our US sales fleet and executive air fleet are found in the Other Carbon category 
in this data summary. Carbon data from natural gas sources are calculated using regional specific emission factors from US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-3 (US weighted average) for all US 
sites; from the Ireland UFCCC for Amgen’s facility in Dun Laoghaire, Ireland; from U.K. Defra/DECC’s 110819 Guidelines for Amgen’s facilities in the United Kingdom (Uxbridge, Abingdon, 
and Cambridge); from the NL Agency standard CO2 emission factors for Amgen’s facility in the Netherlands (Breda); and from the Methodology for Reporting 2011 Version 2.0/Ministry of 
Environment Victoria, BC, December 2011, for Amgen’s facility in Burnaby, Canada. Carbon emissions data from propane and diesel fuel sources (except Amgen’s facility in Juncos, Puerto 
Rico) are calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Stationary Combustion-V.1.0 (Sept 2011). Carbon from diesel use in Amgen’s Juncos, Puerto Rico, facility are 
calculated using specific fuel analysis information and from US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-1. Carbon data from direct energy sources prior to 2011 were calculated using emission factors 
from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Stationary Combustion-V.1.0 (Jul 2009). Scope 1 emissions that are not included in this data summary include fugitive emissions 
from chillers, coolers, and HVAC, as well as process-related emissions from cell respiration (carbon as a by-product) and pH adjustments (CO2 injection). Analysis of these sources in 
2012 showed that our fugitive emissions are less than 3 percent of total carbon emissions when compared with other sources such as energy use and that cell respiration and emissions 
from pH adjustments are negligible (less than 0.1 percent of our total carbon emissions). Processes are in place to maintain chillers, coolers, and HVAC equipment to prevent unintended 
emissions. Amgen has not included fugitive emission sources as a core emission but will continue to monitor these impacts.
(g)Scope 2 carbon emissions result from indirect energy sources defined in note (d). Carbon data from purchased electricity are calculated using emission factors from US EPA eGRID2010 
10/11/2011 Version 3.2 (2007 data: eGRID subregion annual carbon output emission rate) for all US locations except Amgen’s facility in Puerto Rico which has been determined using 
EPA GHG Report YE 2011 for Power Suppliers in Puerto Rico; from the Greenhouse Gas Division, Environment Canada (2006 data)-V.1.0 (April 2009) for Amgen’s facility in Burnaby, 
Canada; and from specific utility annual providers’ reports for Amgen facilities in the United Kingdom (Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge), the Netherlands (Breda), and Dun Laoghaire, 
Ireland. Carbon data from purchased steam are calculated using the Emission Factor for Natural Gas as identified in US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-3 (US weighted average) for Amgen’s 
facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Carbon data from indirect energy sources prior to 2011 were calculated using emission factors from US EPA eGRID2007 Version 1.1 for US facilities.
(h)The Other Carbon category contains Scope 1 and Scope 3 carbon emissions that are tracked but not included in our current CO2 reduction target. Carbon emissions from our 
executive air fleet are calculated using emission factors from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Transport-Fuel-Use (Sept 2011). Carbon emissions from our US sales 
fleet are calculated using emission factors from the GHG Protocol Emission Factors for Petrol passenger cars (volume) (GHG Protocol) = 8.81 kg/gal. Fuel use and mileage data are 
collected at the pump for each vehicle. Carbon emissions from our commercial business travel are calculated by Amgen’s travel provider using the Defra tool. Carbon emissions from 
Amgen’s material transportation have been provided by the carrier using its own specific methods.
(i)Scope 3 carbon emissions are a consequence of the activities of the Company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the Company. Scope 3 carbon emissions that are 
currently tracked include emissions from Amgen’s commercial business travel (air and rail) and material transportation.
(j) Commercial business travel was not tracked in 2007 or 2008. Material transportation was not tracked from 2007 to 2011.
(k) Slight discrepancy between values for total water fate and total water withdrawal is due to rounding and compilation of individual facility totals.
(l) Recycling rate is the proportion of waste that is recycled and reused compared with the total volume of routine, nonhazardous waste generated with potential for landfill disposal.
(m)Treatment means the physical, thermal, chemical, or biological processes that change the characteristics of the waste in order to reduce its volume or hazardous nature, facilitate its 
handling, or enhance recovery.
(n) Nonroutine waste constitutes waste generated outside the normal operations of our facilities and consists mainly of construction and demolition waste.General

(a) The tax effect of the adjustments between our GAAP and “Adjusted” results takes into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each 
adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the US marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including amortization of 
intangible assets and non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including the charge for 
certain legal proceedings and stock option expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the tax jurisdictions where the expenses are incurred or the 
asset is located and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions.Summary of Data — Notes

INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION STATEMENT 
Introduction and objectives of work  
Bureau Veritas North America, Inc. (Bureau Ve ritas) has been engaged by Amgen to conduct an 
independent assurance of select ed environmental data included in Amgen’s 2012 Environmental 
Sustainability Report. 
This Assurance Statement applies to the related information included within the scope of work described 
below.  
The data presented in Amgen’s 2012 Environmental Sustai nability Report is the sole responsibility of the 
management of Amgen.  Bureau Veritas was not involved in the drafting of the Report.  Our sole 
responsibility was to provide independent verification of  the accuracy of selected information included in 
the Report.
Scope of work
Amgen requested Bureau Veritas to verify the accura cy of the following environmental health and safety 
data summarized in Amgen’s Environmental Sustainab ility Report for the Calendar Year 2012 reporting 
period:  
 Energy Use (Total, Direct and Indirect) 
 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Direct Scope 1 and Indirect Scope 2)  
 Water Withdrawal and Fate 
 Waste Quantities and Disposition 
 Fleet Fuel Efficiency 
 Safety Metrics including Injury and Illness Rate, Lost Day Rate and Severity Rate 
 Number of Environmental Violations 
Excluded from the scope of our work is any verification of information relating to: 
 Text or other written stat ements associated with Amgen’s 2012 Environmental Sustainability 
Report 
 Activities outside the defined verification period of Calendar Year 2012 
Methodology  As part of its independent verification, Bureau Veritas undertook the following activities:  
1. Interviews with relevant personnel of Am gen regarding data collection and reporting systems; 
2. Review of Amgen’s data and information system s and methodology for collection, aggregation, 
analysis and internal audit of information used to determine the environmental data; 
3. Review of documentary evidence produced by Amgen;  
4. Audit of Amgen’s data traced back to the source during visits to two manufacturing facilities: one 
in Juncos, Puerto Rico; and, one in West Greenwich, Rhode Island; and 
5. Visit to Amgen’s headquarters location in Thousand Oaks, California to review consolidation of 
site data and to review data collected at a central location. 18Amgen Page 2 
Our work is conducted against BVNA’s standard inte rnal procedures and guidelines for external 
verification/assurance of sustainability reports, base d on current practice in independent assurance. In 
accordance with our internal procedures for limited  assurance, we use the International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 and ISO Standar d 14064-3 Greenhouse gases - Part 3: 
Specification with Guidance for the Validation an d Verification of Greenhouse Gas Assertions as 
reference standards. For this assignment, we ar e also using the GRI Reporting Framework as a 
reference standard. 
The work was planned and carried out to provide limited verification and we believe it provides an 
appropriate basis for our conclusions. 
Our findings    
On the basis of our methodology an d the activities described above: 
 Nothing has come to our attention to indicate t hat the reviewed information within the scope of 
our verification is not materially correct. 
 Nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the reviewed information is not a fair 
representation of the actual environmental and heal th and safety data for calendar year 2012.  
 It is our opinion that Amgen has established appropriate systems for the collection, aggregation 
and analysis of quantitative data, including energy use, direct and indirect GHG emissions, water 
withdrawal and fate, waste quantities and dispositio n, fleet fuel efficiency, injury and illness rate, 
lost day rate and severity, and number of environmental violations.
