  TOMORROW
2019 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTOVERVIEW
As a wealth and asset management company, we help clients achieve 
their financial goals by thinking about the future and where the 
opportunities and challenges lie – and by doing all we can to help 
shape a brighter tomorrow for all. 
What we mean by:  
Corporate responsibility (CR) –  our efforts 
to create shared value for our clients, financial 
advisors, employees, shareholders, business 
partners, communities and society at large.
ESG –  stands for Environmental, Social and 
Governance, and is used primarily in an 
investment context when referring to non-
financial factors that can affect long-term 
investment returns.
Responsible investment – incorporates ESG 
factors into investment decisions and processes 
to better manage risk and generate long-term 
sustainable returns. Learn more on page 33.Contents

APPENDIXA better tomorrow for our clients
Our mission is to improve the financial well-being of Canadians and help 
them achieve their goals at every stage of their lives.
With clients increasingly focused on environmental and social matters – 
whether to achieve better risk-adjusted returns or to contribute to a more 
sustainable future – we strengthened responsible investment practices in 
2019. For example, IG Wealth Management now requires all investment sub-
advisors to be signatories to the Principles for Responsible Investment and 
Mackenzie Investments greatly expanded its company engagements to 
encourage more sustainable business practices. These are significant steps 
in using our influence to help shape the world of tomorrow.
A better tomorrow for our people  
Empowering our people to realize their goals is a longstanding priority for 
IGM. We place a strong emphasis on development and our leaders play an 
active role in ensuring employees get the support they need. In 2019 we 
enhanced our vacation policy, added two paid volunteer days and 
introduced 10 personal wellness days to help our people live life well.
We also embrace diversity and inclusion to improve our business and move 
our industry and society toward a more equitable future. Our highly 
collaborative approach includes support for seven new employee Partners 
in Action groups and partnering with outside organizations like Catalyst, 
Women in Capital Markets and Pride at Work. 
A better tomorrow for our communities
We’re on a journey to increase the financial confidence of four key groups 
who are underserved when it comes to financial literacy: Indigenous 
peoples, newcomers, seniors and youth. We bring this platform to life 
through IG Wealth Management’s Empower Your Tomorrow program.  Our people also play a direct role. In 2019, IG employees and advisors raised 
record amounts for United Way/Centraide charities and came together in the 
IG Wealth Management Walk for Alzheimer’s. The Mackenzie Investments 
Charitable Foundation, an employee-run initiative, celebrated its 20th year 
providing support for women, children and youth in need.  At Investment 
Planning Counsel a volunteer team travelled to Honduras to work with local 
families to build more sustainable communities. These are just a few 
examples of how we are helping to build a healthier, more prosperous and 
resilient society.
Investing in a strong foundation
Exemplary business conduct, robust governance and strong relationships are 
the foundation of our approach and the reason clients put their trust in us. 
It’s something we never take for granted and continually work to strengthen.
In 2019 we announced our support for the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures and convened a cross-functional team to address their 
recommendations. We recognize that the financial services industry has a 
role to play in combatting one of the most significant issues of our time. 
In conclusion, I’d like to extend a heartfelt thanks to all our employees and 
advisors. We take great pride in what they achieve every day. I’d also like  
to reaffirm our commitment that IGM remains focused on investing in 
tomorrow and doing all we can to help build a better future for everyone.

APPENDIXResponding to the COVID-19 pandemic
At the time of writing our 2019 Corporate 
Responsibility Report, we are in a period of 
unprecedented disruption – both in human and 
economic terms – as we all grapple with the 
global COVID-19 pandemic. Our hearts go out to 
the people and families who have been directly 
affected, and the front-line workers who are 
working tirelessly to keep us safe.
We felt it was appropriate to share some  
of the actions we have taken to protect our 
employees, financial advisors, clients, and 
communities, while continuing to support  
the financial well-being of Canadians.
Our business continuity plans are regularly 
reviewed and tested to ensure we’re prepared 
to manage different scenarios. Because of this, 
we were able to rapidly transition almost all of 
our people to work from home in an effort to 
keep everyone safe while serving our clients 
and limiting the spread of COVID-19. We’re 
working hard to make it easy for employees 
and Consultants to do their jobs and advisors  
to do business with us in this new environment 
through digitization and technology efforts.
We’re committed to helping our clients 
navigate these challenging times. We’ve been 
sharing timely information and viewpoints 
about the markets and government support 
measures to help our clients and advisors feel 
more confident.  Our investment professionals are doing  
their part to mitigate risk, while looking for 
opportunities to buy securities at attractive 
prices. The advisors we partner with are  
also working hard to provide personalized 
information and financial planning advice  
to directly support clients.
We understand how important it is to support 
our people through such a difficult situation – 
including support for their physical and mental 
well-being. We have equipped our employees 
and IG Wealth Management Consultants with 
new tools to stay connected virtually and are 
ensuring everyone is aware of all services 
supporting mental and emotional health. We 
have also provided piece of mind to employees 
through a commitment to no COVID-related job 
actions in 2020 and a financial allowance to cover 
additional expenses and help make life a little 
easier. We know that our strong collaboration, 
teamwork and respect for each other truly 
defines what makes IGM such a special  
place to work.    
This has also been a time to underscore our 
longstanding commitment to providing tangible 
support to our communities. Together with 
Canada Life and Power Corporation of Canada, 
IGM made a $1 million joint contribution to 
support the immediate needs of local and 
national foodbanks. IG Wealth Management increased support for United Way’s work with 
isolated seniors and Mackenzie Investments  
for women and children in shelters.
In addition, IG Wealth Management launched 
Answering the Call, a new program to support 
Canadian small and medium-sized businesses 
and their communities as they navigate the 
financial challenges presented by the COVID-19 
crisis. As part of the program, we have set up 
an initiative that will see as much as $500,000 
donated by IG to support local businesses and 
their communities.
And finally, along with over 250 long-term 
investors, IG Wealth Management and Mackenzie 
Investments signed the Investor Statement on 
Coronavirus Response . We recognize the long-
term viability of the companies in which we 
invest is inextricably tied to the welfare of their 
stakeholders and that in a time such as this, 
companies need to know that investors support 
long-term thinking.
Thank you for your trust and confidence.  
As we navigate the new normal, we’re inspired 
by the way people have been coming together, 
showing their humanity and tackling new 
challenges. This gives us hope for tomorrow.OVERVIEW

APPENDIXOVERVIEW
Material ESG topics
In our business and our reporting, we strive to ensure that we address the ESG topics 
that matter most to our company and our stakeholders, and on which we stand to 
make the greatest positive impact. We also address global issues like climate change 
which ultimately affect us all. 
Guided by the GRI Standards, we conduct  
a process annually to identify and prioritize social, 
environmental, governance and economic topics 
relevant to our stakeholders and our company. 
We review our priorities annually to ensure  
we incorporate new knowledge and issues  
as they arise.
When identifying topics, we consider emerging 
trends and issues relevant to our peer group – 
including sector-relevant topics addressed by 
peers, and by GRI, SASB standards and the TCFD recommendations. We also consider issues raised 
in public discussions and through our interactions 
with ESG rating agencies. 
We then undertake a process annually to 
prioritize these topics by considering input from 
both internal and external stakeholders, including 
feedback from our business leaders and 
Corporate Responsibility Committee. While most 
of our stakeholder engagement takes place on a 
day-to-day basis through ongoing interactions, we 
also employ more formal methods of engagement such as surveys, forums and meetings.  
See examples of key 2019 topics raised  
through stakeholder engagement on page 11.
The outcome of this process is a list of current 
material ESG topics that we include in our report. 
We segment these into foundational topics that 
are essential to building and sustaining trust in 
our business, and material ESG topics which are 
both important to our stakeholders and are 
important to IGM’s business success.

APPENDIX“ Every day, there’s something in the news 
about ESG, which goes well beyond 
products. It relates to how we want to 
operate and interact with the world around 
us. Very soon, making decisions based on 
both financial and ESG considerations will 
be commonplace.” 
“ There’s a growing generation of investors 
with higher expectations, and climate 
change is linked to this. Up until now, 
responsible investing was a foggy notion 
[for many clients], but being able to relate 
it to tangible issues like climate change has 
made it real.”  
“ If we can’t show up in a way that reflects 
the diversity of the marketplace, we put 
ourselves at risk. We need to demonstrate 
that we are diverse and can speak to 
diverse audiences.”Five themes from 2019 interviews with business leaders
In preparation for this year’s report we engaged an external CR expert who assisted us in completing  
a process to identify and assess our CR priorities. A series of internal interviews were conducted with our 
business leaders and subject matter experts across our company to prioritize topics and identify and gaps. 
Five key themes
1.  Corporate responsibility and ESG topics are 
gaining momentum  in society and among our 
various stakeholder groups. For example:
 -  Prospective employees and advisors, especially 
the millennials among them, are increasingly 
looking to work with a company whose values 
are aligned with their own and that cares about 
social and environmental impact.
 -  Current employees are telling us they want to 
get more involved in helping community groups 
and programs, and in greening our workplace.
 -  Clients are more aware of ESG issues  
and are interested in investing for social and 
environmental good, as well as financial returns.
 -  Institutional investors and ratings agencies 
want to know that we’re incorporating ESG 
factors into our investment decision-making. 
2 .  Having robust responsible investing processes 
has become table stakes for asset managers. 
Not only do our clients expect it, responsible 
investing is also the area where we can have the 
greatest influence and impact on ESG issues.
3 .  Climate change is one of the most 
significant global risks of our time ,  
and it’s driving change in ESG awareness  
and understanding. Acting on climate change is 
integral to many of our processes, including risk 
management, responsible investing and efforts 
to reduce our environmental footprint.
4.  The representation of women in the 
investment industry is disproportionately 
low. We’re collaborating with others to improve, 
but there’s more work to be done on diversity 
and inclusion overall.
5 .  Financial literacy is a problem in our society 
and, as financial experts, we can and should 
change that.

The United Nations 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) are an urgent 
call to action by all countries to end poverty, 
protect the planet and ensure that all 
people enjoy peace and prosperity. The 17 
goals unite the world in making positive 
changes. We believe that everyone – 
including governments, communities, 
businesses, organizations, individuals and 
ourselves – has a role to play in promoting 
and advancing these wide-ranging goals. 
While we contribute directly and indirectly 
to each of the 17 SDGs, we’ve identified five 
goals that are most material to our business 
and where we believe we can make the 
greatest contribution.

APPENDIXGovernance
We believe that strong governance practices promote the accountability, transparency 
and responsible decision-making needed to support our business and be an industry 
leader over the long term.
The effectiveness of our corporate governance 
starts with IGM’s Board of Directors, which 
provides oversight of the business so we grow 
responsibly. The Board has established robust 
governance structures, processes and practices 
to perform its duties effectively, which are 
essentially the same for our two major operating 
units – IG Wealth Management and Mackenzie 
Investments. Among its responsibilities, the IGM 
Board monitors whether these subsidiaries are 
fulfilling their governance obligations.
The Board has put in place structures and 
procedures to ensure its independence from 
management and to ensure that conflicts of 
interest between IGM and any related entities, 
including Power Financial Corporation (the 
company’s majority shareholder), are dealt 
with appropriately. The Board and Senior Management Diversity Policy 
requires that diversity dimensions be considered 
along with experience in the director nomination 
process so as to achieve the optimum composition 
and balance for the board.
Since the adoption of the policy in 2016,  
83% of vacant board positions have 
been filled by women directors and the 
percentage of women on the Board has 
risen from 12.5% to 33% in 2019.

APPENDIXCorporate responsibility governance
Our Board  has approved a Corporate Responsibility 
Statement , which formalizes our longstanding commitment to 
corporate responsibility. The Board monitors implementation of 
the policy and our CR strategy, and discusses CR plans and ESG 
issues at least annually.  
The Corporate Responsibility Committee , comprised of senior 
executives, is responsible for ensuring the implementation of the 
Board’s Corporate Responsibility Statement and our corporate 
responsibility strategy, as well as the approval of annual reporting. 
The Committee reports to the Board annually or as necessary 
where critical concerns arise. No critical concerns were raised  
 in 2019.
The leaders of our various business units  have primary 
ownership and accountability for identifying and managing  
ESG risks and opportunities across the business.

APPENDIX2019 enhancements
In 2019, an internal team reviewed our governance 
processes and disclosure in response to the 
growing shareholder, rating agency and regulatory 
focus on ESG issues. As a result of this review, we:
•  Updated our Board and Senior Management 
Diversity Policy  in February 2020 by adopting  
a broader definition of diversity – which includes 
women, Indigenous peoples, persons with 
disabilities and members of visible minorities – 
in line with amendments to the Canada Business 
Corporations Act.
•  Implemented a Compensation Claw Back 
Policy  in February 2020, which enables the 
company to recoup incentive compensation  
in the event of executive misconduct  
or material restatement.
•  Enhanced disclosures  in our 2020 Management 
Proxy Circular regarding executive compensation 
and board processes.
We plan to make further enhancements  
in the coming year.Responsible ownership
IGM operates through a number of different 
businesses. When considering potential 
acquisitions, we conduct a robust business 
assessment to identify the potential long-term 
risks and opportunities of the investment.  
ESG factors are considered through this process. 
We oversee IGM’s investments through an active 
ownership approach where our executives sit  
on the boards of directors of the companies we 
control and other strategic investments. Through 
regular interaction with the senior management 
and boards of these companies, we engage on 
ESG issues to ensure that our investments are 
being managed in a manner consistent with  
our responsible management philosophy  
and Corporate Responsibility Statement. 
IGM’s operating companies also take  
a responsible approach when investing  
money on behalf of our clients.

APPENDIXEthics and compliance 
Our commitment to integrity shapes and sustains our business practices. By setting  
a clear tone at the top and establishing the right frameworks and policies across the 
company, we empower our people to create value for clients and other stakeholders, 
while promoting consistently ethical and responsible conduct.
We have robust compliance policies, programs 
and controls across our operating companies, 
which are regularly assessed for effectiveness  
by the business units and periodically through 
our internal audit function.
Key compliance areas
•  Safeguarding against money laundering, fraud, 
bribery and corruption (see page 20)
•  Protecting client information and maintain trust 
(see page 25)
•  Ensuring we offer products and service 
responsibly (see page 31)
IGM’s Code of Conduct affirms our commitment  
to observing high ethical standards, complying with 
all applicable laws and regulations, and avoiding 
conflicts of interest. The Code is distributed annually 
to all of our directors, officers and employees for 
review and acknowledgement. In 2019, we updated 
the Code, aligning it with our Advisor Code of 
Conduct to ensure that everyone is subject to  
the same overriding principles. We also rolled  
out employee training to enhance awareness  
and understanding of our expectations.Our Code is supplemented by various operating 
company policies and procedures that set ethical 
standards and compliance expectations throughout 
the supply chain, including compliance manuals for 
IG Wealth Management Consultants and a Supplier 
Code of Conduct for companies who do business 
with us.
Anti-money laundering  
and anti-terrorist financing
Our enterprise-wide Anti-Money Laundering 
(AML) and Anti-Terrorist Financing (ATF) 
compliance program is designed to detect and 
deter money laundering and terrorist financing. 
The overarching AML Policy applies to all 
subsidiary companies, both domestic and global, 
and ensures that the most stringent of either 
Canadian or local AML regulations apply to our 
global subsidiaries. The policy is reviewed and 
updated annually and is approved by the boards 
of the subsidiary companies.Who has responsibility:  Regular reporting 
on compliance matters is provided to the 
Chief Compliance Officer and the President 
and Chief Executive Officer of IGM Financial, 
and to the IGM Financial Audit Committee. 
Separate boards and committees at the 
operating company level also oversee 
investment management and distribution 
compliance of our funds.
Managing potential conflict  
 across our companies
The IGM Conflicts of Interest Committee was 
formally established in 2018 to enhance our 
identification, review and resolution of potential 
conflicts of interest across our operating 
companies. The committee achieves this through 
education and the promotion of governance and 
oversight processes, working closely with 
business leaders.

APPENDIXElements of AML and ATF compliance program
•  Risk assessments of each IGM company 
including an assessment of affiliate risk.
•  Client identification and due diligence including 
determination of domestic and foreign politically 
exposed persons and heads of international 
organizations.
•  Centralized monitoring and reporting related to 
suspicious transactions, large cash transactions, 
terrorist property, and sanctions screening.
•  Training which is delivered both at the  
time of onboarding new hires and annual 
refresher training. 
•  Independent effectiveness reviews of our 
program, its policies and procedures, risk 
assessments, training and recordkeeping.
We regularly update our AML and ATF compliance 
program to ensure it keeps pace with regulatory 
changes and best practices.
Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
While local standards and practices may vary as 
to what constitutes bribery, we maintain a high 
standard that can be summarized as follows: 
employees may not provide (or offer to provide), 
directly or indirectly, anything of value to anyone 
to get business or retain business, to obtain a 
commercial advantage, or to receive favoured 
treatment, anywhere in the world.Our Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy  
is reviewed and acknowledged annually by all 
directors, officers, employees and advisors of IGM 
and its subsidiaries, and overseen by the IGM Chief 
Compliance Officer.  All of our operations are 
assessed for risks related to corruption,  
and no critical concerns were raised in 2019.
We plan to implement an employee communication 
campaign to raise awareness of the Anti-Corruption 
and Anti-Bribery Policy in 2020.
Political involvement
Our Code of Conduct and our Anti-Corruption 
and Anti-Bribery Policy spell out our positions  
on political contributions and lobbying.
The company’s money, assets, property or other 
things of value may not be contributed, loaned or 
made available to any foreign candidate, party or 
political committee. While the company may, from 
time to time, make charitable contributions, under 
no circumstances should charitable contributions 
be made in an attempt to influence any decision  
or obtain an advantage.
In addition, while we support and respect 
employees’ right to participate in the political 
process, they are prohibited from using company 
funds, goods or services as contributions to,  
or for the benefit of, candidates or political 
organizations in Canada.Whistleblower Policy
In keeping with our commitment to high  
business and ethical standards, we established  
a Whistleblower Policy to address concerns, 
issues or complaints regarding accounting, 
financial, internal controls, auditing matters,  
and legal, compliance or regulatory matters.
The policy, which is overseen by the IGM Chief 
Compliance Officer, applies to each of our operating 
companies and outlines a confidential process for 
raising concerns, including a 24/7 whistleblower 
hotline and website, and a detailed process for  
a comprehensive investigation where warranted.
In 2019, we refreshed our policy and rolled out 
communications to encourage employees to 
report suspected violations of our Code of 
Conduct. The campaign resulted in an uptick 
in the number of people using the tool to 
bring forward concerns.

APPENDIXRisk management
Our company is exposed to a variety of risks that are inherent in our business activities 
– some are traditional financial risks while others, like climate change and cyber security, 
are newer and growing.
IGM’s risk management approach is carried out 
through our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
Framework which includes five core elements: risk 
governance, risk appetite, risk principles, a defined 
risk management process and risk management 
culture. The ERM Framework is established under 
the company’s ERM Policy, which is approved by  
the Risk Management Committee, and aligns with 
industry best practices, including the COSO 
Enterprise Risk Management and Internal  
Control-Integrated Frameworks.
Responsibility for risk management is assigned 
using the “three lines of defence” model, with the 
First Line reflecting the business units having 
primary responsibility for risk management, 
supported by Second Line risk management 
functions and a Third Line Internal Audit function 
providing assurance and validation of the design 
and effectiveness of the ERM Framework.Significant risks that may adversely affect our ability 
to achieve our strategic and business objectives are 
identified and assessed through our ongoing risk 
management process, using a consistent 
methodology across our organizations and 
business units. The ERM Department promotes and 
coordinates communication and consultation to 
support effective risk management and escalation. 
The ERM Department regularly reports on the 
results of risk assessments and on the assessment 
process to the executive Risk Management 
Committee and the Board.Who has responsibility:  The Board of 
Directors provides primary oversight of ERM 
ensuring that appropriate policies, procedures 
and controls are in place. Our executive Risk 
Management Committee is responsible for 
management oversight of our ERM Framework 
and is accountable to the Board. Additional 
oversight is provided by the ERM department, 
compliance group and our internal audit 
department. The Chief Executive Officers  
of the operating companies have overall 
responsibility for overseeing risk management 
of their respective companies.

Environmental and social risks are identified as one of the six 
categories of risks within our ERM Framework. They include risks 
related to climate change, biodiversity, pollution, waste and the 
unsustainable use of energy, water and other resources, as well 
as social risks related to human rights, labour standards, 
diversity and inclusion, and community impacts.
The Board’s risk management oversight includes ensuring  
that material environmental and social risks are appropriately 
identified, managed and monitored. The Company’s executive 
Risk Management Committee provides oversight of the risk 
management process, while other management committees, 
such as the Corporate Responsibility Committee, provide 
oversight of specific ESG risks, formalized through our  
Corporate Responsibility Statement. 
Our Supplier Code of Conduct was put in place to address 
environmental and social risks in our supply chain. It includes 
provisions related to human rights and labour practices, and to 
improving environmental performance.
In 2019, we deepened our commitment to integrating climate 
change risk and opportunities into our business by announcing 
our support for the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). To prepare for 
reporting in line with the TCFD recommendations, we delivered 
customized TCFD training to business leaders and convened a 
cross-functional climate risk working group to benchmark IGM’s 
climate preparedness across the business. The group’s work 
continues, including development of an implementation plan  
to advance business unit strategies and practices.

APPENDIXThe business of climate change
The Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on 
Climate-Related Disclosures (TCFD) has been  
a catalyst in shifting climate change perspective 
from an environmental-only issue to a financial 
issue also.
IGM shares this view and in 2019 we announced 
our support across the IGM group of companies 
for recommendations developed by the TCFD.  
This commitment is aligned with our longstanding 
involvement in the annual CDP survey on climate 
change, and our commitments at IG Wealth 
Management and Mackenzie Investments to the 
Principles for Responsible Investment.
“The TCFD’s goal is to help companies disclose 
useful information on the financial impacts of 
climate change to their business so stakeholders 
can make sound financial decisions,” says Andrea 
Carlson, IGM’s Vice-President, Finance and 
Corporate Responsibility. “This makes the TCFD 
important for at least two of our stakeholders: 
our clients, who rely on us to manage the risks 
and opportunities in their portfolios; and our 
shareholders, who want to understand how we’re 
managing climate change across our business.”
2019 was a significant year for IGM in this area. 
Climate risk became a regular agenda item in 
meetings of our Risk Management and Corporate 
Responsibility Committees, and climate change 
education was incorporated into annual 
enterprise risk management meetings  with leaders to increase awareness across  
the business. Working with an external  
climate advisor, we completed a project  
to assess IGM’s readiness to comply with  
the TCFD recommendations, which resulted  
in an implementation plan including customized 
training for leaders directly involved in executing 
the TCFD plan. IGM was recognized for the second 
year in a row by CDP as a climate change 
disclosure leader, earning a place on its “A List”. 
We recognize that TCFD implementation will  
be a multi-year journey involving leaders from 
across the business. Our immediate priorities 
are to gain broad agreement and build 
understanding of our beliefs and objectives  
on how we’ll fulfill our responsibilities around 
climate change. We also want to ensure that  
we have clear roles for management and the 
Board, and we are reviewing tools to assist  
with climate metrics and scenario analysis  
within our investments.  
“While our public support for the TCFD 
recommendations is new, we’re not starting 
from scratch. CDP and PRI have been 
increasingly aligning with the TCFD 
recommendations, so we’re looking forward  
to building on our success in advancing  
the business of climate change.”ELEMENTS OF THE TCFD 
RECOMMENDATIONS
The Task Force developed four widely-adoptable 
recommendations on climate-related financial 
disclosures that are applicable to organizations 
across sectors and jurisdictions and structured 
around four thematic areas representing core 
elements of how organizations operate: 
Governance
The organization’s governance around  
climate-related risks and opportunities
Strategy
The actual and potential impacts of climate-related 
risks and opportunities on the organization’s 
businesses, strategy, and financial planning
Risk Management

assess, and manage climate-related risks

APPENDIXInformation security and privacy 
In a business built on trust, we must take every precaution to safeguard  
the privacy of our clients’ information and protect our systems and technology. 
Technology and cyber security
We use systems and technology to support our 
business operations and the client and financial 
advisor experience. As a result, we’re exposed to 
risks such as data breaches, identity theft or 
hacking, which could compromise confidential 
information and lead to financial loss, reputational 
damage or regulatory actions.
Technology and cyber security risks are identified as 
operational risks in our ERM Framework. We have a 
very low appetite for these types of risks and our 
Framework emphasizes operational risk 
management and internal controls. Business unit leaders are responsible for managing 
day-to-day risks, supported by company-wide 
programs, policies, training, standards and 
governance processes. Key technology policies 
include our Acceptable Use of Technology Standard, 
which sets the company’s expectation for all 
employees, advisors and contractors with respect 
to the proper use of technology and intellectual 
property and the protection of cyber security.Who has responsibility:  Our Vice President, 
Technology Risk & Chief Information Security 
Officer is responsible for all aspects of the 
implementation, management and execution 
of our information technology security, risk 
and compliance framework. Our Chief 
Technology and Data Office ensures 
compliance with all relevant application 
security and cyber security standards, and 
applicable laws and regulations. This office 
regularly reports to the Board on our cyber 
risk and information security strategy.

APPENDIXIGM is committed to investing in security 
technologies and specialized security talent  
to identify, protect against, detect and respond  
to cyber security threats in a timely manner.  
To remain resilient to such threats, we follow 
sound industry practices and have implemented 
threat and vulnerability assessment and response 
capabilities. Our endpoint detection and response 
software is integrated into our security operations 
centre, which is equipped to respond quickly  
to any threats in our environment. Proactive 
cyber response and threat hunting exercises 
enable us to track intruders across our systems, 
understand root causes and contain any threats 
with minimal disruption to the business. 
Should there be a major business disruption, we 
implement a company-wide incident response and 
business continuity management program, which 
covers remediation activities, continuity of critical 
operations and processes, and recovery of systems. 
Through our affiliation with the Power Financial 
Corporation group of companies, we have the 
strength and efficiency of a security platform  
that is both global in scale and expertise.
  
Regular internal and third-party assessments  
of our security procedures ensure they remain 
relevant and effective. These include assessments 
by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions and the Investment Industry 
Regulatory Organization of Canada. We recognize that the human element is equally 
important in data protection and have established  
a continuous employee security awareness and 
training program. Knowledge sharing is ongoing 
with annual mandatory training for employees, 
advisors and contractors. Cyber security training  
is aligned to Public Safety Canada’s Cyber Security 
Awareness Month.  
We also participate in industry-established 
forums and collaborate with peers on threat 
intelligence and critical security threats facing  
the global financial services sector:
•  The Financial Services Information Sharing  
and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC)  is an industry 
consortium dedicated to reducing cyber-risk  
in the global financial system. Serving financial 
institutions around the globe, the organization 
leverages its intelligence platform, resiliency  
resources and a trusted peer-to-peer  
network of experts to anticipate  
mitigate and respond  
to cyber threats.•  The Canadian Center for Cyber Security
builds strategic partnerships with Canada’s critical 
infrastructure owners and operators to share 
enhanced cyber threat information and promote 
the integration of cyber defence technology.
“ In this day and age, it’s critical for everyone  
to have some level of cyber security savvy.  
As we know, the attacks keep coming and 
evolving. Our frontline staff are our first line 
of defense. We need staff to understand the 
risks and threats so they can be proactive 
and help stop them.”

Client experience 
Our focus on the client experience is key to building the long-term relationships that  
enable us to deliver the best outcomes for our clients and drive our company’s success.  
In a competitive marketplace, we must anticipate market shifts, listen closely to what  
clients tell us about their needs and expectations, and act on what we learn.
The one-on-one relationships between clients 
and advisors are at the heart of every IGM 
operating company’s success. They often span 
decades and, over that time, advisors get to know 
their clients well and work closely with them to 
ensure they’re on track to meet their financial 
goals. We do everything we can to strengthen 
these relationships.
All of our operating companies have in-house 
contact centres that support financial advisors in 
serving their clients. Each contact centre regularly 
solicits feedback from advisors to identify issues 
and improve service levels. 
In addition, we conduct formal research to 
gather feedback from clients and advisors: 
•  IG Wealth Management  regularly surveys 
clients to measure various aspects of their 
relationship with their Consultant and their 
experience with financial planning, and to align 
advisor compensation with client satisfaction. 
Select clients share their insights and ideas with 
senior leadership through a client advisory council 
chaired by the General Counsel. IG Wealth Management also gathers feedback from 
financial advisors about the quality of their 
business relationship with the company through 
quarterly satisfaction surveys. 
•  At Mackenzie Investments , advisor satisfaction 
is measured through the annual Environics 
Advisor Perception Study. This is the most 
comprehensive tracking study of Canada’s mutual 
fund and insurance companies and is a valuable 
benchmark that provides vital information on 
how each company is perceived by the advisors 
who distribute their products. 
•  At Investment Planning Counsel , we conduct a 
quarterly advisor satisfaction survey. The survey 
results feed into an Advisor Satisfaction Index, 
which provides insights from our advisors on 
how to better serve our clients. In addition,  
 a task force meets monthly to review 
commentary from advisors to identify  
trends and address immediate needs.Who has responsibility:  Our distribution, 
client service, operations and product 
leadership teams are responsible for defining 
and delivering on client and advisor 
satisfaction priorities. IGM’s Client and 
Regulatory Affairs office, led by our Executive 
Vice-President and General Counsel, is also 
responsible for championing a client-centric 
vision for business initiatives, planning and 
strategy across the enterprise. As of 2020, 
every IG Wealth Management and Mackenzie 
Investments employee is required to have at 
least one performance objective linked to 
client or advisor satisfaction, stressing the 
strategic importance of these measures.

APPENDIXFinancial well-being
We believe that providing Canadians with the 
knowledge and resources they need to understand 
their personal finances, helps them to build a better 
financial future for themselves and their families.
With a network of Consultants across the country 
who specialize in comprehensive financial planning, 
IG Wealth Management is uniquely positioned to 
increase the financial well-being of Canadians in 
communities from coast to coast. Personalized 
financial advice is what we do best.
Finances can be even more difficult to comprehend 
when there are additional barriers. This could 
include a lack of resources, a lack of access,  
or even language barriers. The Empower Your 
Tomorrow program will help level the playing field 
for everyone. See page 53 for more information 
on how we are increasing financial confidence  
in our communities.
Product and service responsibility
Underpinning our approach to client experience  
is a strong ethical foundation, which shows up in 
many ways, including how we sell our products  
and communicate with clients.Marketing and sales communications
Our mutual fund offerings are qualified for sale 
through the filing of a prospectus with regulators. 
All of our sales communications to clients in 
connection with those offerings are reviewed  
for accuracy and compliance with securities rules. 
We also have internal policies, processes and 
procedures to ensure we remain compliant  
with applicable requirements and avoid  
conflicts of interest.
In addition to applicable laws and regulations,  
our people must comply with internal policies in 
communicating product and service information. 
These policies are designed to ensure that clients 
are informed and provided with full, true and plain 
disclosure about our products and services.
Clarity of products and pricing
In 2019, IG Wealth Management started migrating 
clients to a new enhanced, unbundled pricing 
model, by which clients pay a separate advisory 
fee that isn’t rolled into mutual fund management 
fees. Mackenzie Investments has made several 
changes to its mutual funds and ETFs, introducing 
fee reductions, simpler and more competitive 
pricing for a number of products, and fund 
mergers to streamline its product offering.  
These changes all work to bring clarity  
to pricing and make products easier to  
navigate, for both investors and advisors. Fee Transparency
In 2019,  Investment Planning Counsel  
streamlined its product offering into five distinct 
portfolio families, providing investors and advisors 
with increased clarity of choice based on their 
financial planning objectives, including the ability 
to choose fee options that are fully unbundled, 
partially unbundled or the traditional bundled series.
IG Wealth Management  is increasing fee 
transparency by making unbundled solutions 
available to all client segments in the fourth 
quarter of 2019. Previously, these solutions  
have been available only to high  
net worth clients.

Financial advisors affiliated with IG Wealth

understand the financial and personal situations 
of clients to ensure the suitability of their 
investments for their particular circumstances. 
Mackenzie Investments distributes its products 
through third-party advisors and dealers who  
are subject to their internal rules. 
Our securities dealers and advisors are responsible 
for conducting due diligence on all products that 
are available for sale to clients. A team of experts 
reviews and assesses the products to ensure they 
are suitable to offer to our clients. 
Issue resolution
Should issues arise, our operating companies have 
formal procedures to handle written or verbal 
complaints from clients. They are guided by 
principles of fairness, timeliness and reasonability  
in their assessment of each issue.
Clients’ first point of resolution is their advisor.  
Call centres at each company assist with routine 
inquiries and complaints. When problems are 
escalated, the resolution process includes a 
thorough examination of the complaint. The 
investigator contacts the client and a personalized 
review of the client’s concern occurs. The client 
receives a written summary of the investigation 
addressing their concerns.Related publications

APPENDIXResponsible investment 
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics are increasingly important to 
clients and investors – some of whom see ESG integration as a means to achieve 
better risk-adjusted returns, and others who want to drive positive societal change. 
We have a long-standing practice of being responsible investors to better manage  
risk and generate long-term sustainable returns for our clients.
All IGM operating companies have formalized their 
commitments through Responsible Investment (RI) 
policies, which outline the approach taken to 
integrate ESG criteria in investment analysis and 
decision-making processes, and to enable active 
ownership through engagement and proxy voting. 
This approach is aligned with the long-term 
interests of our clients, with the financial markets 
and economies in which we operate, and ultimately 
with broader social and environmental goals. IG 
Wealth Management and Mackenzie Investments 
are signatories to the Principles for Responsible 
Investment (PRI), which offers a framework for 
integrating ESG factors into the investment analysis 
and decision-making process for mainstream 
investment managers. There are, however, differences between our 
operating companies because of their distinct 
business models. IG Wealth Management and 
Investment Planning Counsel offer investment 
funds to their retail clients which are managed by 
high-quality external investment managers (sub-
advisors). As a result, their role is to monitor and 
evaluate the RI practices of these sub-advisors. 
Mackenzie Investments is an investment manager 
providing investment solutions to retail, institutional 
and strategic accounts through a boutique structure 
that includes internal investment teams along with 
external sub-advisors in select areas. As such, it plays a 
more direct role in responsible investment.
More information about each operating companies’ 
approach is provided on the following pages.Who has responsibility:  Oversight of 
responsible investment policies and processes 
is the responsibility of the Senior Vice-President, 
IG Investments, at IG Wealth Management; the 
Chief Investment Officer at Investment Planning 
Counsel; and the Executive Vice-President, Chief 
Investment Officer and Head of SRI Investing at 
Mackenzie Investments. Product leadership at 
each of the operating companies also plays a 
role in designing ESG product solutions to meet 
our clients’ needs. IG Wealth Management and 
Mackenzie Investments both have Responsible 
Investment Committees that includes broad 
representation to advance implementation of 
responsible investment practices.
Responsible investment  
includes a variety  
of approaches  
and strategies:ESG integration
Embedding ESG issues into 
traditional investment analysis  
and decision-makingThematic investing
Investing in ESG themes  
such as women in leadership

APPENDIXAt IG Wealth Management, our approach  
to responsible investment focuses on selecting  
high-quality investment firms to manage our 
investment funds and monitoring their ongoing 
performance. We believe this approach delivers 
strong diversification benefits to clients in that 
each firm has a unique investment philosophy, 
style and approach. 
The sub-advisors chosen are among the world’s 
largest and best-in-class global investment 
management firms – and they include companies 
such as Mackenzie Investments, Blackrock, T. Rowe 
Price and PIMCO. Sub-advisors are selected 
through a rigorous due diligence process that 
includes evaluation of their ESG practices. 
As of year-end 2019, IG Wealth Management 
requires all sub-advisors to be PRI signatories, 
which commits them to integrate ESG factors  
into their investment analysis and decision-making 
processes, alongside traditional financial analysis.
We also require our sub-advisors to:
•  Demonstrate active ownership  through 
engaging directly with company management  
on ESG issues and through proxy voting.•  Leverage ESG tools  to target investments  
in industry-leading companies that exemplify 
strong ESG practices.
•  Provide formal ESG measurement and reporting . 
In addition to ESG integration across all investment 
funds, IG Wealth Management offers clients the 
proprietary IG Mackenzie Summa SRI fund. 
Launched in 1987, the fund was one of the first  
of its kind in Canada, and is focused on companies 
with progressive practices towards environmental, 
human rights and other social issues.
Investment Planning Counsel’s approach to 
responsible investment focuses on three pillars – 
monitoring the ESG integration practices of sub-
advisors, being active owners, and monitoring our 
portfolios for alignment with international norms. 
These three pillars work together to enhance the 
sustainable characteristics of our sub-advised 
investment mandates and maintain and improve 
long-term outcomes for the benefit of our clients. 
All sub-advisors for Counsel Portfolio Services 
and IPC Private Wealth are encouraged to consider 
ESG issues in their investment process, which is 
monitored and reviewed regularly for consistency 
with IPC’s practices.Working with ISS, a leading provider of corporate 
governance and responsible investment solutions, 
we have adopted a sustainability proxy voting 
policy that seeks fair labour practices, non-
discrimination and the protection of human rights. 
This policy applies to all equity holdings. Through 
ISS, we also participate in a pooled engagement 
service representing almost US$1 trillion in assets 
that engages companies assessed under their 
norms-based research to be involved in failures to 
respect international norms.  Over 100 companies 
were the focus of corporate engagement in 2019.
In 2019, Investment Planning Counsel launched a 
dedicated ESG portfolio that takes ESG optimization 
to a higher level. The objective of the IPC ESG 
Balanced Essentials Portfolio is to provide long-term 
capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity 
and fixed-income ETFs with top ESG scores in their 
category, while aiming to reduce volatility.
Across IGM, we support the Anti-Personnel 
Landmines Convention and the Convention on 
Cluster Munitions, as international efforts aimed at 
addressing humanitarian concerns surrounding the 
use of these weapons. We will not knowingly invest 
in companies involved in the production, use or 
distribution of anti-personnel landmines or cluster 
munitions where we control the investment policy.

APPENDIXMackenzie Investments’ approach to responsible 
investing across its asset management activities is 
centered on: 
•  Integration of ESG criteria in investment 
analysis and decision-making processes  – ESG 
factors are considered as part of the investment 
process across all of our 14 investment boutiques. 
While each team has the autonomy to take a 
unique approach, our Responsible Investment 
Committee meets at least quarterly to share best 
practices on ESG integration and engagement. 
Each team has at least one representative on the 
Responsible Investment Committee. We strongly 
believe that having in-house responsible 
investment champions who also have portfolio 
management responsibilities fosters buy-in and 
more effective implementation of our 
responsible investment practices.In 2019, there was a focus on making non-financial 
data more accessible to the investment process 
through the integration of ESG data into 
mainstream investment tools.
•  Active ownership  – Engagement with company 
management and proxy voting are important 
value-added practices within our investment 
process. Engagements are undertaken by both 
our internal investment teams and by EOS at 
Federated Hermes (EOS), a third-party 
engagement specialist. Under this arrangement, 
our voice is combined with those of like-minded 
shareholders to exert greater influence over ESG 
issues. We generally adopt a policy of engagement 
over divesting a holding. 
In 2019, EOS engaged with 560 companies held in 
Mackenzie Investments’ accounts on 1,803 
environmental, social, governance, strategy, risk and 
communication issues. See page 37 for more on 
how our work with EOS is making a difference.In 2019, Mackenzie Investments appointed 
a Head of Sustainable, Responsible and 
Impact (SRI) Investing, reporting directly 
to the CEO, to develop an integrated SRI 
strategy and approach, design dedicated 
SRI solutions, support the advancement of 
ESG integration, and advocate for ESG both 
within and outside the firm.

APPENDIXCreating positive change through responsible investment
ESG topics like climate change and diversity  
are some of the most significant drivers of change 
in the world today, with implications for businesses 
and investors. While pension funds and institutional 
investors have long considered ESG risks and 
opportunities in their investment processes,  
 retail investors are now joining them – with IGM 
companies overseeing the investment of $165 
billion of client assets under management. 
“Since 1926, IG Wealth Management has been 
developing new and innovative ways to responsibly 
invest our clients’ capital in order to maximize 
their investment returns. Today, our commitment 
to responsible investing has expanded to include 
being a proud signatory to the United Nations 
supported Principles for Responsible Investment 
(PRI) partnering exclusively with high-quality 
global asset managers who also subscribe to the 
PRI. This means they integrate material ESG risks  
and opportunities into investment decisions and 
are active owners who engage with companies  
to improve their ESG practices and disclosures. 
We believe our approach aligns with our clients’ 
long-term investment goals and generates positive 
outcomes for the world,” says Jon Kilfoyle, Senior 
Vice-President, IG Investments.
“Engaging with the companies in which we invest 
to encourage them to adopt ESG best practices  
is one of the ways we drive positive change  
on behalf of our clients,” says Fate Saghir, new 
Head of SRI Investing at Mackenzie. Mackenzie 
Investments engages in two ways – directly through its investment teams, or through 
Federated Hermes, a third-party engagement 
specialist. In 2019, we engaged with approximately 
800 companies on more than 2,000 topics.
Federated Hermes focuses its efforts on the 
broader societal goals of the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) to align its efforts  
to some of the world’s biggest challenges. As the 
accompanying diagram illustrates, 801 of the 
engagements conducted for Mackenzie Investments 
in 2019 related to issues like climate action, decent 
work, and responsible consumption and production. 
The SDGs are designed to coordinate efforts 
globally to achieve a better and more sustainable 
future for all.
“In addition to engagement, we’re focused  
on providing best practice tools to enable our 
investment teams to integrate ESG into their 
processes,” says Nan Marques, Senior Vice-
President, Investment Management at Mackenzie 
Investments. “ESG integration is a process of 
continuous improvement as more and more  
data and analytical tools become available in the 
marketplace. In 2020, one of our areas of focus 
will be on enhancing our analytical capabilities 
around carbon intensity and climate change  
 in general,” adds Nan.

Talent and culture
Our people are at the heart of our business – everything we do depends on them.  
We achieve more as a company, and contribute more to society, when we attract the 
right talent and create a culture that empowers them to grow, flourish and achieve 
their  potential.
Fostering a high-performing and diverse culture is a 
strategic focus. Our people programs are designed 
with this objective in mind – right from building a 
strong and diverse talent pipeline, to creating a 
fulfilling employee experience, to helping employees 
achieve their health, well-being and financial 
security goals.
IGM’s training and development approach, designed 
to identify the unique skills and knowledge required 
by each individual, along with our use of feedback 
from our annual Gallup® employee survey, contribute to engagement and best position our 
people to serve our clients. 
In 2019, our ongoing efforts to align programs 
across IGM resulted in the harmonization of our job 
structure, improvements to vacation allowances 
and the introduction of wellness days for increased 
flexibility, and more volunteer days, which took 
effect in January 2020. These changes are discussed 
in the Development (page 42) and Health and 
Wellness (page 44) sections of this report.Who has responsibility:  The Board’s Human 
Resources Committee reviews and approves

During our annual 48-hour hackathon, 75 employee volunteers in 15 teams were invited to tackle one of three business  
challenges: onboarding, performance management or professional development. The winning team created a platform

Talent attraction
We rely on our people to do great work, so it’s 
important to get our hiring right, especially as 
pertains to increasing the diversity of our workforce. 
In a competitive market for talent, we’ve developed 
a plan to deepen our employee talent pool by 
establishing a centralized talent attraction process, 
growing our pipelines and networks, and leveraging 
social media, data and internal talent to target 
candidates. We’ve also improved the recruiting 
experience for candidates through the introduction 
of standardized processes and consistent, unbiased 
interview techniques. 
Among the people we want to attract are business 
students and new graduates. Our operating 
companies offer paid co-op internship and new 
graduate program opportunities through 
partnerships with leading universities. IG Wealth 
Management is one of the few companies in 
Manitoba, outside of traditional public accounting 
firms, that is an approved Certified Professional 
Accountant (CPA) training office. This offers students 
a non-traditional career path to meet their practical 
experience requirements. Our work rotation 
programs pair new university graduates with senior 
executives and professionals in various departments to 
enable these future leaders to gain valuable work 
experience and develop our talent pipeline.At IG Wealth Management, we’ve also implemented 
a centralized talent sourcing strategy to attract 
highly qualified advisors who provide financial 
planning services to our clients. This strategy is 
beginning to show results: more people joined us 
with prior financial industry experience in 2019, and 
we attracted more diverse candidates, with women 
representing 39% of new advisors, up from 36% 
in 2018.
The IGM group of companies aims to be a  
top employer of choice in our peer group.

Development
Through an IGM program called Leading 
Performance: Building Careers, we’re enhancing our 
approach to developing people and fostering high 
levels of performance. The program focuses on 
setting clear expectations on behaviours and 
performance objectives, providing ongoing 
coaching and feedback, and implementing personal 
development plans for all employees. Employees’ 
annual objectives are aligned with company 
strategy, and leaders are required to hold quarterly 
meetings to review progress. 
2019 Performance management highlights
•  Adding a people-centric objective  to leaders’ 
annual performance plans. Weighted at 25%, the 
objective holds leaders accountable for 
communicating strategic priorities and 
implementing a robust performance review 
process that includes establishing development 
plans, setting high-quality objectives and assessing 
leadership behaviours. 
•  Creating a new framework  that aligns jobs 
across IG Wealth Management and Mackenzie 
Investments, giving employees better insight into 
opportunities for growth and development, 
supporting career path mobility across our 
companies, and improving understanding of how 
jobs contribute to the business.In a 2019 survey, the majority of our 
employees said the people-centric objective 
for leaders is making an impact, and they’re 
seeing more focus on development planning 
and execution.
Learning opportunities at IGM include formal 
training, feedback and coaching, and on-the-job 
experience both for our own employees and for the 
financial advisors we work with. We also encourage 
external training and offer reimbursement 
programs to help cover costs. 
Here are a few of our high-impact 
development  programs:
•  Launched in 2011, LEADing at IGM (LEAD)  is our 
hallmark program for high-potential leaders, which 
features experience-based development through 
work on real projects. It was designed to develop 
our top talent into top leaders with a high capacity 
for productivity, collaboration and creativity. 
Initially a Mackenzie Investments’ program, the 
program was expanded in 2019 to include IG 
Wealth Management. In December 2019, 15 
individuals graduated from the eighth cohort, for a 
total of 131 graduates since the program began. 
•  IG University  is IG Wealth Management’s 
enhanced learning institute for advisors. 
Programming is anchored to the core pillars of 
financial planning, practice management, 
professional responsibility, products and leadership development, and segmented from a 
fundamental to expert level. Programs, training 
and resources include more than 1,900 hours of 
continuing education accredited content. Many 
programs are delivered in partnership with leading 
business schools. Within the first year of IG 
University, 53,788 courses were completed by IG 
Wealth Management Consultants.
•  Mackenzie Investments  has a dedicated practice 
management team that works with advisors to 
support them in managing and growing their 
business.  The team offers advisors workshops, 
keynotes, tools and resources on topics such as 
leadership, marketing, branding, technology, process 
and self-management. In 2019, the practice 
management team delivered more than 230 
presentations nationally. 
•  Investment Planning Counsel  adopted more 
social learning methodologies in 2019, combining 
peer leaders and industry experts in highly 
interactive sessions for advisors.
Our leadership development approach includes a 
consistent succession planning framework to 
identify and develop employees who have 
leadership potential, and to identify successor 
candidates for critical senior roles. Annual talent 
and succession reviews assess leadership potential, 
and assist us in creating strategies to develop talent 
and take other steps, as required. Training and 
resources are geared to the specific needs of 
leaders and targeted high-potential individuals.

Engagement
The passion and dedication of employees are key drivers of our 
culture, client experience and shareholder returns. Each of our 
companies has a strong focus on engagement and, through the 
confidential Gallup employee engagement survey, regularly 
seeks employees’ opinions, to understand what matters to 
them, how we’re doing and how we can improve.
The survey asks 12 foundational and 24 key theme questions 
related to corporate values and priorities, such as opportunities to 
learn and grow, performance conversations, having friends at work, 
coworkers’ commitment to doing quality work, recognition, and 
having a caring culture.
Leaders review Gallup results with their work teams, and then work 
individually and as a group on action plans for improvement. This 
ongoing cycle contributes to team discussion, accountability and 
action, and enables our people to contribute to their own 
development and to the success of the group.
We were very pleased with our 2019 results:  
97% of employees completed the survey and 
engagement scores increased across the board.98%

Diversity and inclusion
We prioritize diversity and inclusion (D&I) because we want to reflect the vibrancy and 
mosaic of Canada, and we believe that D&I will help us elevate our performance, grow 
our business, and learn from one another.
IGM’s D&I strategy is aimed at fostering an 
inclusive, equitable and consistent experience for 
employees, advisors and clients that supports the 
corporation’s business objectives now and into 
the future. It focuses on three pillars of action: 
raising awareness; improving inclusive 
leadership behaviours; and increasing external 
partnerships and community engagement.  
The advancement of women in the workplace is a top 
priority and IGM has committed publicly to adhering to 
the United Nations Women’s Empowerment 
Principles . With guidance from organizations such as 
GATE, Catalyst and Women in Capital Markets, we’re 
implementing targeted strategies and initiatives aimed 
at enabling the upward mobility of existing talent and 
increasing sourcing opportunities for external talent. 
While the ultimate goal is gender parity, we’ve set a 
short-term objective of having at least 35% of IGM 
executive roles – vice president and above – held by 
women by 2020. IG Wealth Management has also set 
an objective of having at least 35% of its independent 
financial advisors be women by 2025. Indigenous peoples are another focus area, and we 
have plans to deepen our collaboration with 
community partners. With the support of our 
Indigenous Partners in Action team, we offer 
employee training on the history of Indigenous 
relations and the need for reconciliation. 
IGM Partners in Action (PIA) teams are critical for 
fostering a culture of inclusion. These employee-led 
groups bring together individuals with shared 
interests, values or affinities to act as change makers 
and champions of an inclusive workplace. Other 
initiatives supporting inclusion are unconscious bias 
training available to all employees, training and 
communications on our Respectful Workplace Policies, 
and promotion of multi-cultural calendar observances 
to build awareness of all dimensions of diversity.

2019 diversity and inclusion highlights
•  IG Wealth Management conducted an online 
survey  to provide a benchmark on advisor 
demographics, attitudes towards diversity and 
feelings about inclusion in our region offices,  
and inform action plans. Participation was 32% 
higher than in 2017 when the survey was last 
conducted. Among the key learnings: 83% of 
respondents believe that all different types  
of people are respected in their region; and 
perceived barriers are decreasing in the areas  
of age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability  
and religion or beliefs.
•  Indigenous drummers and Land 
Acknowledgements  kicked off our annual 
Employee Forum and Leadership Summit, 
enhancing Indigenous awareness among more 
than 1,400 people. More than 100 leaders 
participated in the inclusive leadership session 
offered at the Leadership Summit. 
•  We held a special IGM employee event on March 
2nd to celebrate  International Women’s Day.  
Offices across the country were treated to a 
livestreamed presentation by Camilla Sutton, 
President and CEO of Women in Capital Markets, 
on how leadership, transparency and culture 
shape the different experiences of men and 
women in the workplace.•  Several other education events were similarly 
well attended in 2019:
-  Taking the Stage  training for women was 
delivered to 271 employees and advisors from  
IG Wealth Management, and 32 employees from 
Mackenzie Investments. 
-  Unconscious bias training was completed by 
181 participants from IG Wealth Management 
and 87 from Mackenzie Investments.

better understand the policies and actions that 
have affected Canada’s Indigenous Peoples, was 
attended by 125 employees and advisors from  
IG Wealth Management, and 13 employees from 
Mackenzie Investments, bringing the total number 
to 343 since the program’s introduction in 2017.
•  Events organized by our PIA teams included 
speed networking events hosted by Mackenzie 
Women in Action Team; a lunch n’ learn panel 
and Q&A with senior leadership organized by 
Mackenzie NextGen; recognition of Orange Shirt 
Day and National Indigenous People’s Day at  
IG Wealth Management to show support for 
Indigenous reconciliation; monthly lunch and 
learn webinars hosted by the LGBTQ2S+ team; 
and Coffee and Conversation sessions hosted

Return to Bay Street  
As part of our journey to becoming a more 
gender-balanced, diverse and inclusive workplace, 
Mackenzie Investments welcomed two participants 
from the Return to Bay Street program in 2019. 
This innovative program offered by Women  
in Capital Markets (WCM), one of our industry 
partners, plays an important role in retaining 
professional women in the financial industry  
by providing a pathway back to their successful 
careers after an extended period of leave – 
typically due to family obligations. 
As a participating firm, we gain access to a pool  
of skilled and experienced female talent who are 
seeking to relaunch their careers, have proven 
success in mid to senior-level capital markets roles 
and are ideal candidates for hire. Women in the 
program gain valuable experience that will make  
it easier to secure a fulltime position in the capital 
markets, including at Mackenzie Investments.
Erica Roa joined as an Emerging Markets fixed 
income investment analyst after a three-year 
absence from the industry during which she  
not only took care of her young daughter but  
also pursued her master’s degree. “I applied  
to the Return to Bay Street program because  
it allowed me to showcase my experience, 
education and passion for capital markets  
to companies committed to increasing female 
participation and leadership in the industry,” says 
Erica. “Being part of the Mackenzie Fixed Income 
team has been a rewarding experience for me.  I’m working with talented individuals who are 
always willing to share perspectives, collaborate 
and learn from each other.” 
Alana Cherwenka Cameron joined Mackenzie’s 
Portfolio Construction group where she works with 
our distribution team, evaluating and identifying 
investment strategies that will improve portfolio 
outcomes. Seven years ago, Alana took a sabbatical 
to spend time at home with her young family.
Once her children were in school fulltime, she was 
ready to get back into the industry. “The biggest 
challenge was overcoming the bias associated with 
having a time gap on my resumé. Plus, I needed  
to convince potential employers that my skills were 
up to date or could be easily updated,” says Alana.Alana Cherwenka Cameron ,

APPENDIXFinancial confidence
As a financial services company, one of the best ways we can strengthen communities  
is by offering our resources and expertise to help Canadians feel confident about their  
finances, so they can achieve their goals and own their financial future. 
IG Empower your Tomorrow focuses on assisting 
four key groups who are underserved when it 
comes to financial guidance: Indigenous peoples, 
newcomers, seniors and youth. We bring this 
platform to life through our IG Wealth Management 
Consultants, national partnerships, community 
seminars, events and educational materials. 
Key Groups
•  Indigenous Peoples  – Indigenous peoples are 
a vital part of our country’s culture, yet many 
face unique barriers to financial wellness on a 
daily basis. It’s crucial that we set Indigenous 
families up for a financially successful future. 
We partner with organizations like 
Opportunities for Employment to provide 
financial education and job training to 
Indigenous Peoples and we fund scholarships 
for Indigenous students at both the local and 
national level with organizations like Indspire. 
•  Newcomers  – Learning the financial systems of 
a new country can be daunting, which is why we 
work with the Canadian Foundation of Economic 
Education (CFEE) to provide financial education 
in newcomers’ first language. We also have a longstanding partnership with United Way and 
support local chapters across the country so 
they can offer financial literacy programs 
to newcomers. 
•  Seniors  – The seniors, parents and grandparents 
of our communities often face unique financial 
challenges that come with age. We offer support 
through financial planning workshops designed 
to guide seniors through financial considerations 
in collaboration with our national partners 
including the Alzheimer Society of Canada.
•  Youth  – Our future teachers, caregivers, 
business leaders and professionals need to 
start off on the right financial foot. With the help 
of the CFEE, we’ve distributed more than 
500,000 copies of Money and Youth textbooks 
to students across the nation and hosted 
thousands of students at workshops. 
Recognizing basic literacy as a precursor to 
financial literacy, we also support Dyslexia 
Canada’s Mark it Read national campaign, which 
raises awareness and support for the 10% to 
20% of Canadian children living with dyslexia.STRENGTHENING OUR COMMUNITIES
In the fall of 2019, we updated and re-launched 
our Money & Youth financial literacy textbook  
and website, which reached more than 43,000 
high school students across Canada. In addition, 
textbook usage by IG Wealth Management 
Consultants totaled approximately 6,300,  
a 96% increase over 2018.
50 CFEE/IG Wealth Management financial literacy 
workshops delivered to nearly 1,000 seniors  
and newcomers, with IG Wealth Management 
Consultants participating in about 60% of them.

Community support
Through giving, volunteering and partnering with others, we strengthen  
the communities where we live and work, and build the foundation  
of a healthier, more prosperous and more equitable society for all.
Our community ties are strong, and we 
have a long history of making a difference 
at the grassroots and national levels.  
Both IG Wealth Management and 
Mackenzie Investments are designated  
a Caring Company by Imagine Canada, 
which works to strengthen Canadian 
charities and non-profits. Caring Companies 
commit to contributing at least 1% of their 
average annual pre-tax profit to charitable/
non-profit organizations, and to enabling 
personal giving and volunteer activities  
of their employees.
Each of our operating companies  
has its own community giving program, 
with its own guidelines and combination 
of centralized giving, directed from our 
corporate head offices, and decentralized 
decisions made by their people. Our people 
have the ability to direct donations to 
causes that are most important to them:
•  At IG Wealth Management , our 
Consultants and employees support their 
respective communities through our employee-led Community Projects Fund, 
Matching Gift program and Volunteer 
Support Program. As well, we allocate 
budgets and decision-making directly  
to region offices across the country.
•  At Mackenzie Investments , community 
initiatives including donations and 
matching programs are managed  
by employee volunteers and the 
Charitable Foundation. 
•  At Investment Planning Counsel , this 
is done under the banner of IPC Cares, 
through an employee-driven Spirit 
Committee and self-directed initiatives 
run by advisors in their communities. 
We encourage our people to volunteer  
in their communities and recognize 
exceptional contributions through  
various community service award 
programs. Volunteer efforts at each 
company are facilitated through planned 
events, paid volunteer days and ongoing 
support for Canada’s National Volunteer 
Week every April.Who has responsibility: At each operating company, 
philanthropy and employee involvement strategies  
are approved by the respective President and CEO.  
The Vice-President of IGM Sponsorship and Community 
Engagement works with the management teams of our 
operating companies to review the community 
investment strategies annually. Strategic oversight  
of the Mackenzie Investments Charitable Foundation  
is by an independent board.

In 2019, IG Wealth Management contributed 
$6.95 million to approximately 850 community 
organizations.
We focus primarily on programs that are an 
extension of our vision to inspire the financial 
confidence of Canadians (see page 53). This includes 
for example our national sponsorship of the IG Walk 
for Alzheimer’s, the largest fundraising initiative for 
the Alzheimer Society of Canada. Our sponsorship 
is an opportunity for IG Consultants, employees  
and clients to come together to raise funds and 
awareness to help families living with Alzheimer’s 
disease and other forms of dementia. 
Through our IG Empower Your Tomorrow annual 
giving campaign, we raised $828,000 for United Way/
Centraide charities in 2019, our highest ever, with 
donations coming from more than 1,150 donors.
In 2019, Mackenzie Investments contributed $2.93 
million to more than 500 community and sport 
organizations across Canada.
Through the employee-driven Mackenzie 
Investments Charitable Foundation, monies are 
raised each year to assist charities, with a focus on those that help children, youth at risk and 
vulnerable women. The Foundation is funded by 
donations from employees, which are matched 
dollar for dollar by the company. Since the 
Foundation was established in 1999, it has provided 
more than $12.1 million in grants to the community. 
Each fall, our people come together to raise funds 
in creative ways for our 34 partner charities. To kick 
off the 2019 event, we introduced the Mackenzie 
Caring Cup, a friendly competition in which 
departments earned points through financial 
donations, in-kind donations, attendance at 
events and volunteering in organized activities 
with the partner charities. 
Through sponsorships, we recognize and  
support Canadian athletes in fulfilling their 
dreams. We signed a four-year sponsorship  
of Alpine Canada and Freestyle Canada, and 
continued to support grassroots alpine skiing 
through a partnership with Alpine Ontario.  
We also have a six-year partnership with the PGA 
TOUR Canada as the tour’s first umbrella sponsor. 
The Mackenzie Tour-PGA TOUR Canada raised 
more than $1 million for 12 charities across 
Canada in 2019.
Mackenzie Investments was the  
presenting sponsor for the first-ever 
Women’s Expedition  to Baffin Island, 
Nunavut, on behalf of True Patriot  
Love Foundation in 2019Under the IPC Cares banner, we support and 
promote community engagement and giving 
among employees and financial advisors to 
grassroots charities, both locally and abroad.  
Our international efforts include a multi-year 
relationship with communities in Honduras, where 
we help build basic infrastructure, raise funds and 
provide in-kind donations to local communities.

 A heart-centered partnership  
Among the many community causes that IPC Cares 
supports, our work in Honduras is especially close 
to our hearts. Since 2016, several volunteer teams 
have travelled to Honduras to work side-by-side 
with local families on community projects, with 
additional paid vacation provided by Investment 
Planning Counsel.
With each trip, our mission is to help families  
in a specific village become sustainable. First,  
we help meet basic needs as determined by the 
community – often by building water containment 
units, latrines or cement floors to improve water 
supply and sanitation. Then we look at how we can 
help lift people out of poverty; for example, by 
promoting access to quality education or 
establishing micro-credit unions to fund 
sustainable businesses. 
“We chose to help the families of Honduras 
because it’s one of the poorest countries  
in the world with more than 66 per cent of the 
population living in poverty,” says Chris Reynolds, 
IPC’s President and CEO, who has participated in 
each trip. “In rural areas, Hondurans rarely have an 
education past the sixth grade due to cost and 
family obligations, and approximately one out of 
five lives in extreme poverty, or on less than US 
$1.90 per day.”In 2019, a team of IPC advisors and staff helped 
families in the village of Carboneras by completing 
seven latrines and five cement floors over 10 days. 
Each night after work, they gathered with the 
villagers to play games, make bracelets, colour and 
chat – sharing many laughs despite language 
barriers. “As one of the Hondurans said to us  
in a teary moment, ‘we don’t have to speak the 
same language to know that you care,’” says Chris.
Thirteen people joined Chris on the 2019 trip.  
It may have only been 10 days, but the impact  
on both the proud people of Carboneras and  
our IPC team will last a lifetime.

Environmental footprint
We rally around efforts to reduce our environmental footprint because they improve  
our operational efficiency and are a means by which everyone at IGM can play an active  
part in tackling climate change and caring for our planet. 
We focus on managing direct impacts from our 
operations in four main areas – energy use, 
employee commuting and business travel, waste 
management and paper use. These are the areas 
where we have the greatest environmental 
impact and where improvements will help reduce 
our GHG emissions.
Specific environmental commitments are 
formalized in our Environmental Policy , which all 
employees agree to annually when signing the 
Code of Conduct. Expectations for our suppliers, 
set out in our Supplier Code of Conduct , include 
compliance with applicable environmental laws and 
conducting their activities in an environmentally 
responsible manner.
Since 2016, we’ve engaged an energy and data 
management company to track and manage 
information across our owned and leased offices 
to provide more accurate and timely data and 
make recommendations for operational 
improvements. We’ve set greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emission reduction targets for Scope 1 and 2 
emissions, and continue to look for ways to better 
measure and manage the impacts from 
Scope 3 emissions. Employee green committees are the drivers 
of many of our initiatives to reduce paper, 
waste and energy consumption – and they 
are the key to achieving our reduction targets.
Third-party reviews of our environmental practices 
are an integral part of our approach. We conduct 
annual waste audits in our corporate offices to 
highlight improvement opportunities and increase 
engagement with employees. We also externally 
assure our annual greenhouse gas emissions 
statement for all Scope 1 and 2, and Scope 3 travel 
emissions and applicable reduction targets.Who has responsibility:  All staff play a role in 
managing the environmental impacts of our 
operations but the most direct accountability 
lies with IGM’s Chief Operating Officer, who is 
also the executive sponsor of the IGM Green 
Council. Responsible for creating a consistent 
culture of environmental awareness and 
practices across our operating companies, 
the Green Council consists of leaders from 
Facility Management, HR, CR, Information 
Services and Community Investments, and 
the chairs of the employee green committees.
40% reduction in 
absolute Scope 1 and 2 
GHG emissions by 2020
This target represents a 
reduction of 932 tonnes from 
our 2013 emissions of 2,330 
tonnes CO2e 50% reduction in 
absolute Scope 1 and 2 
GHG emissions by 2036

APPENDIXSTRENGTHENING OUR COMMUNITIES
Energy management
Electricity and natural gas consumption at our 
owned and leased properties is the primary 
driver of energy use. We regularly invest in green 
building upgrades at our corporate and regional 
offices, including installing efficient heating and 
cooling systems, air handling units, information 
technology systems, LED lighting and motion 
sensors. We also review the footprint of IG Wealth 
Management and Mackenzie Investments head 
offices and IG Wealth Management’s regional 
offices to ensure we’re using space efficiently. 
IG Wealth Management participates in the 
Manitoba Race to Reduce initiative both in  
a leadership advisory role and by actively 
participating in the race to reduce energy  
use at the head office building it owns.  
Race to Reduce is a challenge which began  
in 2017, where commercial building landlords 
and tenants publicly commit to work together  
to reduce the total collective energy use in 
participating buildings by at least 10% over  
four years.
The remainder of our office space is leased by 
our operating companies. Our ability to directly 
manage energy consumption in shared leased 
premises is more challenging, as the vast majority 
of the space is in large multi-tenant buildings. New LED lighting at the IG Wealth 
Management head office uses daylight 
harvesting to maintain constant illumination 
levels, balancing the LED lights with outside 
natural light. Sensors automatically turn off 
lights in a localized area when no 
movement is sensed.
Renewable energy
Since 2015, we’ve purchased green natural gas  
to match the annual conventional natural gas used 
at the IG Wealth Management and Mackenzie 
Investments head offices. Not only does this 
investment lower our GHG emissions enough to 
exceed our 2020 goal, it supports the development 
of the renewable energy industry in Canada.

Waste and recycling
Each of our operating companies is committed to 
reducing waste and recycling wherever possible. 
All of our corporate head office buildings offer 
multi-material recycling and organics composting 
services. We also donate used office and computer 
equipment to charities, and where donation of 
computer equipment is not possible, we partner 
with suppliers to recycle the remaining 
electronic  equipment.
Although we offer paper shredding and recycling 
programs at all offices, we’re challenged to offer 
consistent multi-material recycling programs in IG 
Wealth Management leased offices across the 
country due to varying municipal recycling 
capabilities and landlord approaches. IG Wealth 
Management continues to review options, 
including using our influence as a tenant to 
increase waste diversion services across 
the country. 
We follow a design standard for offices that 
includes use of recycled materials, energy-efficient 
lighting and other environmentally friendly 
materials, while recycling furniture and producing 
as little waste as possible through the project. 
These standards are incorporated across the 
country as new offices are built and others 
are  refurbished.Mackenzie Investments’ head office is 
transitioning to centralized waste bins, which 
have proven to divert 60% to 80% from the 
landfill in similar building s.
Travel and commuting
As a global financial services company, we engage 
in business travel as a necessary part of our 
operations. Employees are encouraged to consider 
their business travel requirements carefully and, to 
the extent possible, we’ve transitioned to 
videoconferencing and online training to reduce 
travel needs and costs. In 2016, we began 
purchasing green fuel and carbon offsets, which 
further reduced the impact of commercial air 
travel by approximately 65% in 2019. 
We support our employees and clients in using 
low-carbon commuting options. This includes 
financial support for employees using public 
transit programs and providing access to lockers 
and showers and safe bike lock-ups, where 
possible. In the state-of-the-art Investment 
Planning Counsel head office, we offer preferred 
parking and charging stations for green vehicles, as 
well as preferred parking for those who commute 
in a high-occupancy vehicle. We’re working with 
our landlords to expand the availability of electric 
charging stations for clients at IG Wealth 
Management region offices.Reducing paper use
We continually seek opportunities to reduce paper 
used for communications, marketing, reporting 
and other business operations. We also use 
recycled paper and paper from responsibly 
managed forests. Our photocopiers are pre-
programmed to print double-sided and track usage 
to determine priorities for paper reduction projects.
In 2019, we introduced monthly print reports for 
each employee at IG Wealth Management and 
Mackenzie Investments offices. The report lets 
them know how many pages they printed, how 
their printing levels compared to their colleagues, 
and the cost associated with their printing. When 
tested with a pilot group, this approach resulted in 
a 25% reduction in paper usage. 
Our goal is to reduce pe rsonal paper use by 
50% by year-end 20 20

APPENDIXThree cheers for our green committees  
“For all the progress we’ve made in reducing our environmental footprint, 
there’s no question that our green committees have provided the 
inspiration, education and motivation to keep moving us ahead,” says 
Trevor Skidmore, Chair of the IG Green Committee.
“Committee members’ commitment and creativity is showcased in events 
and initiatives with our Communications and Facilities teams throughout 
the year. In 2019, there were waste sorting games, an educational video 
starring fellow employees, downtown clean-up days, and fun competitions 
for prizes,” says Jon Ennis, Chair of the Mackenzie Green Committee.
One of the current focus areas for both companies is to remove individual 
desk-side waste bins in exchange for centrally located collection areas to 
improve waste diversion rates. Recognizing that this requires a substantial 
change in behaviour, the initiative was piloted at Mackenzie Investments 
and the learnings will be shared with IG Wealth Management as the bins 
are rolled out in its Winnipeg head office in 2020. 
“Our 2020 waste audits will give us some indication of how successful the 
bin initiative has been. The green committees use the annual audit findings 
to identify where improvements can be made and inform their annual 
plans. Tracking performance and reporting to the executive-level IGM 
Green Council on a quarterly basis is a really important part of our 
success,” adds Jon.Green committees are composed of 10 to 15 employee volunteers who are 
committed to raising awareness and engagement around the importance of 
adopting environmentally responsible practices, at work, at home and in the 
community. The committees focus on four areas and align their initiatives with 
our corporate environmental goals:
Paper reduction  – reduce personal paper use by 50% from 2017 to year-end 2020
Waste managemen t – eliminate plastic water bottles and implement centralized 
waste bins
Travel  – achieve carbon neutral commercial air travel through fewer flights and 
the purchase of carbon offsets 
Energy conservation  – support IGM’s greenhouse gas reduction goals (see page 57)
Trevor Skidmore, 
Chair of the IG Green Committee“Working together across the companies gives us an opportunity  
to learn from each other and share ideas and materials. It’s also  
a great way for us to feel connected across the country, working 
with our peers on such important work,”

management by category of liquidity classificationQuantitativePercentage of AUM by liquidity category: 
(1) highly liquid—more than 95%; (2) moderately liquid—not applicable; (3) 
less liquid—less than 5% (this relates to two funds, IG Real Property Fund  
and IG Mortgage Fund (50% in mortgages and 50% fixed income instruments); 
however, these funds are predominantly part of IG managed solutions and, 
thus, liquidity risks are minimized); and (4) illiquid—not applicable.

In Canada, NI 81-102 sets out requirements which limit the percentage 
of illiquid assets that can be held in a mutual fund. IGM companies have 
processes in place which measure and monitor illiquid assets to ensure 
compliance with NI 81-102. Most of IGM’s AUM are liquid. Liquidity risk is 
managed in accordance with OSC/FCC guidelines and regulations and internal 
assessments. IGM designs and implements appropriate measures based 
on redemption risks, liquidity needs and ownership. Further, IGM allocates 
specific minimum liquid percentages (MLP) based on two-, 30- and 90-day 
liquidity conversion needs, which are assessed at the individual security level. 
Liquidity levels are monitored closely on a monthly and quarterly basis and 
reviewed by the CIO and head of compliance.

We believe that financial services companies have an important role  
to play in addressing climate change, which is why we support the TCFD 
recommendations. We recognize that full implementation of TCFD will  
be a multi-year journey for IGM and our operating companies, involving 
various business areas including enterprise risk management, corporate 
responsibility and investment management.Our support for TCFD is also aligned with our longstanding commitment to 
participate in the annual CDP survey, which promotes corporate disclosures 
on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change management. For the past 
two years, we were recognized by CDP as a corporate leader in climate 
change disclosure with a position on its Climate Change A List. 
Here is a summary of our approach in line with the TCFD Recommendations:
TFCD Topic Our IGM Approach
GOVERNANCE: Disclose the organization’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities
BOARD OVERSIGHTOur Board oversees corporate responsibility policy and strategy, including climate-related matters. Through its risk management 
responsibilities, the Board is also responsible for ensuring that material climate-related risks and opportunities are appropriately identified, 
managed and monitored.
MANAGEMENT ROLEOur Chief Financial Officer oversees implementation of the Corporate Responsibility (CR) program and the Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) program. The CFO is a member of the CR Committee, which oversees implementation of the CR policy and strategy, including climate 
change, and the Risk Management Committee, which oversees the company’s risk management process.
Oversight of responsible investment policies and processes is the responsibility of the Senior Vice-President, IG Investments, at IG Wealth 
Management; the Chief Investment Officer at Investment Planning Counsel; and the Executive Vice-President, Chief Investment Officer at 
Mackenzie Investments. Product leadership at each of the operating companies also plays a role in designing ESG product solutions to 
meet client needs.
STRATEGY: Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such 
information is material.
IDENTIFICATION  
OF RISKS AND  
OPPORTUNITIESClimate-related risks are identified through our ERM process, and opportunities through our product development and business planning 
processes. For example, in the shorter-term, there may be exposure to weather-related risks in our mortgage portfolio, or opportunities to 
meet demand for environmentally focused investment products. In the mid to longer term, risks may include credit risk and asset volatility 
from carbon-exposed investments. 
We are looking to enhance our process to identify and assess physical and transition risks and opportunities as they relate to the 
investment process.

women in leadership.
-  The Mackenzie Global Environmental Equity Fund which focuses on opportunities in environmental sectors, notably in energy transition

RESILIENCE AND CLIMATE SCENARIOSAs tools are developed for the Canadian asset management industry, scenario planning will form part of our strategy to better understand how 
our clients and the company will be impacted by various climate change scenarios. We are following industry developments in this area. 
RISK MANAGEMENT: Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.
PROCESS TO IDENTIFY, ASSESS 
AND MANAGE CLIMATE RISKSClimate-related risks are identified through our ERM process, and opportunities through our business planning process. 
At Mackenzie Investments, our investment teams have ESG data to incorporate into their investment processes. At IG Wealth Management 
and Investment Planning Counsel, sub-advisors are responsible for integrating ESG factors into the investment process. In 2020, we plan to 
review tools to enhance our ability to assess climate-related risks in our investment portfolios.
ENGAGEMENT  PROCESSESMackenzie Investments, through Hermes EOS and its int ernal investment teams, engages with companies on a variety of issues including 
climate. Climate change is a priority engagement topic for Hermes EOS.
At Investment Planning Counsel, a pooled engagement service provider is used to work with companies to enhance corporate behaviour 
and strategy related to topics including climate change.
METRICS AND TARGETS: Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities where such information is material.
METRICS AND TARGETSWe set, monitor and report on climate change-related metrics and targets annually in our CDP response and in this report.
We collect operational footprint data and measure and report on our IG Real Property Fund. We are reviewing tools to further our reporting of 
emissions metrics in our investment portfolios.
We have set emission reduction and renewable energy targets in our operations as a first step and are on track to meet these goals:
- 40% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2020  
- 50% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2036  
- 80% of Scope 1 natural gas to be renewable by 2020 
As we continue to develop our climate strategy, we will review our targets to continue measuring our progress.

Forward-looking statements
Certain statements in this Release, other than 
statements of historical fact, are forward-looking 
statements based on certain assumptions and 
reflect IGM Financial’s current expectations. Forward-
looking statements are provided to assist the reader 
in understanding the Company’s financial position 
and results of operations as at and for the periods 
ended on certain dates and to present information 
about management’s current expectations and plans 
relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that 
such statements may not be appropriate for other 
purposes. These statements may include, without 
limitation, statements regarding the operations, 
business, financial condition, expected financial 
results, performance, prospects, opportunities, 
priorities, targets, goals, ongoing objectives, 
strategies and outlook of the Company, as well  
as the outlook for North American and international 
economies, for the current fiscal year and 
subsequent periods. Forward-looking statements 
include statements that are predictive in nature, 
depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, 
or include words such as “expects”, “anticipates”, 
“plans”, “believes”, “estimates”, “seeks”, “intends”, 
“targets”, “projects”, “forecasts” or negative versions 
thereof and other similar expressions, or future or 
conditional verbs such as “may”, “will”, “should”, 
“would” and “could”.
This information is based upon certain material 
factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing 
a conclusion or making a forecast or projection  
as reflected in the forward-looking statements, including the perception of historical trends, current 
conditions and expected future developments,  
as well as other factors that are believed to be 
appropriate in the circumstances. While the 
Company considers these assumptions to be 
reasonable based on information currently available 
to management, they may prove to be incorrect.
By its nature, this information is subject to inherent 
risks and uncertainties that may be general or 
specific and which give rise to the possibility that 
expectations, forecasts, predictions, projections or 
conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that 
assumptions may not be correct and that objectives, 
strategic goals and priorities will not be achieved.
A variety of material factors, many of which are 
beyond the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ control, 
affect the operations, performance and results of the 
Company, and its subsidiaries, and their businesses, 
and could cause actual results to differ materially 
from current expectations of estimated or 
anticipated events or results. These factors include, 
but are not limited to: the impact or unanticipated 
impact of general economic, political and market 
factors in North America and internationally, interest 
and foreign exchange rates, global equity and capital 
markets, management of market liquidity and 
funding risks, changes in accounting policies and 
methods used to report financial condition (including 
uncertainties associated with critical accounting 
assumptions and estimates), the effect of applying 
future accounting changes, operational and reputational risks, business competition, 
technological change, changes in government 
regulations and legislation, changes in tax laws, 
unexpected judicial or regulatory proceedings, 
catastrophic events, outbreaks of disease or 
pandemics (such as COVID-19), the Company’s  
ability to complete strategic transactions, integrate 
acquisitions and implement other growth strategies, 
and the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ success in 
anticipating and managing the foregoing factors.
The reader is cautioned that the foregoing list is not 
exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the 
Company’s forward-looking statements. The reader 
is also cautioned to consider these and other factors, 
uncertainties and potential events carefully and not 
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
Other than as specifically required by applicable 
Canadian law, the Company undertakes no obligation 
to update any forward-looking statements to reflect 
events or circumstances after the date on which such 
statements are made, or to reflect the occurrence of 
unanticipated events, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or results, or otherwise.
Additional information about the risks and 
uncertainties of the Company’s business and material 
factors or assumptions on which information 
contained in forward-looking statements is based  
is provided in its disclosure materials filed with the 
securities regulatory authorities in Canada, available 
at www.sedar.com .
