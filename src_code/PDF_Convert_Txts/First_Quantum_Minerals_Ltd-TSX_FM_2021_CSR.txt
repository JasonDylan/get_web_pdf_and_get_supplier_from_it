2021ENVIRONMENTAL,  
SOCIAL AND  GOVERNANCE REPORTHEALTH & SAFETY
The health and safety of the Company’s 
employees and contractors are of utmost importance to us. Tragically, in June 2021, a road traffic incident occurred which resulted in the loss of a life at our Kansanshi mine. This incident has been subject to thorough internal and external investigation, and the learnings have been shared through the Company. The incident underlines the critical importance of our continued focus on health and safety at all of our operations.
CLIMATE CHANGE
We published our inaugural Climate Change Report earlier this year, aligned to Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures recommendations. This report sets out our greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets for 2025 and 2030. The recently announced 430MW wind and solar project in Zambia will allow us to further increase the proportion of renewable power used by our Zambian operations, which is currently 85% renewable. As we seek to lower the GHG emissions intensity of our LETTER FROM THE CHIEF

I am pleased to present our ESG report for 2021, which sets out our  
performance in environmental, health & safety, social and governance  
areas. This year’s report, our fifth setting out our performance, builds on  
our commitment to the ongoing development of our sustainability reporting  
and increased transparency to our stakeholders. 
metal production, we have implemented 
internal carbon pricing in our evaluation of new projects.
INNOVATION
Our results-driven culture means continual focus on cost and production efficiencies, whilst realising real sustainability benefits. We see the delivery of innovation projects as crucial to optimising the use of key resources by our operations, as we have done with Trolley Assist, which we have spent ten years developing with equipment manufacturers. The technology lowers diesel consumption and increases productivity with a reduced GHG emissions profile while also delivering cost savings. We now operate the world’s largest ultraclass fleet operating on Trolley Assist at Cobre Panama with plans to expand its use across our major operations.
SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE
We continue to invest in our people and have recently approved the construction of additional and improved accommodation in Kalumbila and in 
Panama that will serve our workforces at the Sentinel and Cobre Panama mines. Furthermore, our ongoing contributions to the host communities around our mines seek to ensure our operations have a positive impact on those around us, including improvements to local infrastructure. These efforts build upon previous projects such as the construction of schools, health facilities, water pipelines, bridges, roads and airports, underlining our ongoing commitment to support our communities in Zambia, Panama and Mauritania. 
RESPONSIBLE GROWTH
The metals that we mine are essential to the global transition to a low carbon economy. With the demand for copper and nickel required for electric vehicles and renewable energy infrastructure expected to significantly increase within this decade and the challenges associated with commissioning new mines, First Quantum’s responsible approach to mining will be key. 
2We are committed to extracting 
resources responsibly and the importance that we place on environmental and social sustainability is an intrinsic part of everything we do.  First Quantum has more than doubled copper production in the last ten years. We see that disciplined growth in the production of copper and nickel will enable decarbonisation and drive socioeconomic development. 
As we continue to grow 
towards 1 000 000 tonnes  of annual copper production, our people and our host communities remain key to our success. We strive for ongoing excellence in our delivery of projects and the operation of our mines with social responsibility and sustainability at the heart  of our business.

RESPONSIBLE MINING AND  
THE ENERGY TRANSITION
OUR PRIMARY PRODUCT, COPPER, 
IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY, SECURITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION. 
With copper being a catalyst to the 
global transition to a low carbon economy and a key driver for the socioeconomic progression of developing economies, the positive impact of the copper mining sector will be significant to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). The renewable energy and electric vehicle transition is expected to drive an increase in the demand for copper as the electrical infrastructure requirements to drive the necessary changes to the global energy markets are significant. 
THE GLOBAL TRANSITION TO A LOW 
CARBON ECONOMY REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN THE MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR ENERGY GENERATION, MOVING AWAY FROM FUEL TO MINERALS. 
The pace of development for the 
new supply of transition minerals, in particular copper, represents a very significant challenge for the global mining industry, and the world. The important role that emerging economies have to play in the production of the metals essential to the low carbon transition, such as copper, means that responsible mining can be a key driver of economic development through increased government revenues, employment opportunities, infrastructure development and investment, and the transfer of knowledge and technology to host governments and communities. THE WORLD WILL NEED MORE COPPER 
AND AT FIRST QUANTUM, WITH OUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN EXECUTING AND DELIVERING MAJOR COPPER PROJECTS, WE WANT TO BE THE PARTNER OF CHOICE TO DEVELOP  NEW MINES. 
In the last ten years, we have more than 
doubled our copper production to more than 800 000 tonnes per year driven by the development and commissioning of the Sentinel copper mine in 2017, and more recently the Cobre Panama mine in 2019. In the near future our growth will continue in a disciplined manner, focused on brownfield and greenfield growth. As the world’s 6th largest producer with one of the largest copper resources, First Quantum is well placed to support the transition to a low carbon economy through our responsible approach to mining and our emphasis on UN SDGs. 
Growth in copper production remains 
important to First Quantum even as we seek to reduce the intensity of our environmental and climate impact. We believe that responsible growth is achievable by ensuring that our projects meet higher hurdles for environmental and climate impact into the future. For this reason, First Quantum has implemented a carbon price for the evaluation of new projects.AVERAGE TIME TO

An essential part of our strategy on sustainability is the 
identification and assessment of material sustainability topics at our operations. Identified material economic, environmental and social topics help First Quantum to understand the impact of our operations and guide strategic planning. In addition, these topics guide our reporting and allow us to prioritise information which is of value to our stakeholders. Through the annual revision of our material topics, we seek to proactively identify relevant material topics to aid in the transparent disclosure around our impact and contributions that our operations have in line with stakeholder needs. 
In 2020, The Company commissioned an independent 
review of the materiality of our environmental, social and safety disclosures. The review included an analysis of our existing disclosures, a priority ratings review and a disclosure gap analysis. The Company expanded on this materiality assessment during the course of 2021 through active engagement with stakeholders, taking in consideration their expectations and feedback. Internal guidance on material topics were taken from risks identified through our group business risk register. In addition, the legal and regulatory requirements in which we operate and the direct economic, environmental and social impacts of our activities have been taken into consideration. Key topics identified from discussions with internal and external stakeholders were collated and mapped along with the 2020 material topics. This list was refined by analysing the relevant industry sustainability frameworks and sustainability strategy.
Our disclosure focuses on environmental, social and safety 
aspects that are considered to be of material significance to our Company and our stakeholders. The disclosure includes information and data on activities at our operations, closed properties, development projects, supporting offices and global exploration where we have financial and operational control.

Where available, each site purchases 
electricity directly from independent electricity suppliers. Typically, these are large scale utility companies servicing thousands of clients across a national electricity grid. The energy we generate on site is not included in the purchased electricity consumption, but is included in the overall energy consumption. Where independent power is not available, our sites generate their own power.

SCOPE 1 AND SCOPE 2
The Company has a core commitment to 
minimise energy consumption by a continued prioritisation of innovation, improving efficiencies and reducing wastage. GHG emissions are generated during the direct combustion of fuels on site (Scope 1) and by independent suppliers of electricity (Scope 2). Given the scale of our operations and the quantities of energy required, our GHG emissions are considered significant.
In 2021, our absolute Scope 1 Greenhouse Gas 
emissions increased by 5%, while the Scope 2 emissions increased by around 10%. Our Scope 1 emissions increase was principally due to increased coal and diesel consumption at Cobre Panama as production levels were at full capacity for the year following reduced operations in 2020 due to health and sanitary protocols imposed in response to COVID-19. 
SCOPE 3 (UPSTREAM)
We have also provided estimates of downstream Scope 3 emissions for each operating site. Downstream Scope 3 emissions typically include all of the emissions associated with producing a final product. These emissions are therefore associated with the transportation, smelting and refining of copper concentrate, and copper anodes to produce copper cathode. The estimated Scope 3 emissions are not associated with any upstream activities or supply chain emissions.

Cu-eq INTENSITY  
(TONNE CO2e/TONNE Cu-eq)
Our Scope 1 GHG emissions per tonne of copper 
equivalent increased in 2021 compared to 2020. This is a result of increased fuel consumption required for increased production. The increased consumption of fuel for power lowered the demand for electricity supplied by the grid. Therefore, the combined Scope 1 and 2 GHG emission intensity for 2021 is broadly in line with the scope 1 and 2 GHG emission intensity in 2020.
First Quantum has provided estimates of downstream 
Scope 3 GHG emissions per tonne of copper equivalent for each operating site. Downstream Scope 3 emissions typically include all of the emissions associated with producing a final product. These emissions are therefore associated with the transportation, smelting and refining of copper concentrate, and copper anodes to produce copper cathode. The estimated Scope 3 emissions are not associated with any upstream activities or supply chain emissions. In 2021 the scope 3 intensity values have increased by 30%, a result of greater volumes of copper concentrate being transported compared to 2020.

1 014At First Quantum, we believe that an effective 
Environmental Management System (EMS) is key to sound environmental practice and to reducing environmental risk. The Company has implemented EMSs at all of its operations.
The EMSs, which are aligned with the ISO14001: 
2015 standard, are subject to annual external compliance audits. As part of the EMS, the Company has implemented a five tier environmental incident classification system.
All operations are required to record and 
report incidents monthly according to this classification.
A serious Level 4 or Level 5 incident 
is communicated to the CEO and the Environmental, Health and Safety and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee immediately.ENVIRONMENTAL

5%ANNUAL TARGET OF REDUCING  
LEVEL 3  INCIDENTS BY DECREASE IN LEVEL 3 INCIDENTS SINCE 2017
While the company aims to reduce all 
environmental incidents across the group, we have always focused on the incidents with the highest potential, namely Levels 3, 4 and 5. These incidents have the biggest potential impact on the environment around our operations and will always be a priority. In 2021, we again recorded no level 4 or 5 incidents and reduced our Level 3 incidents by more than 15%. Our level 1 and 2 incidents increased significantly in 2021. The increase is largely attributable to improved incident reporting and a maturing EMS at Cobre Panama, as the mine ramped up to steady state production levels. The large number of Level 1 and 2 incidents is useful in identifying trends and events with greater potential. As further controls are implemented at Cobre Panama, we are confident that the number of incidents will reduce. Kansanshi showed an increase in Level 3 incidents in 2021. The increase is a function of the significant organic growth experienced at Kansanshi over the last 16 years. A number of action plans are in place to reduce these incidents.

COBRE PANAMA
Cobre Panama lies entirely within the 
Mesoamerican Biological Corridor of the Panama Atlantic (MBCPA) and the Golfo de los Misquitos Forests Important Bird Area. The region supports very high biodiversity and is also home to the Santa Fe and Omar Torrijos National Parks. In recognition of the site's high biodiversity and biological sensitivity combined with some gaps in scientific knowledge in the area, Cobre Panama has made the following commitments:
1.
 T
he Company has developed  
and implemented a Biodiversity Action 
Plan (BAP). The BAP  enables continuous collection of information on flora and fauna in  the project area and the integration of new knowledge into bio-diversity management practices over the life  of mine and beyond;
2.
 T
o have a net positive impact (NPI) on 
biodiversity in Panama and to be a world leader in biodiversity management;
3.
 T
o follow both national regulations, 
as described in its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), and international best practices for biodiversity management, such as those described in the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standard 6 (PS6), the Business and Biodiversity Offset Program’s (BBOP) Standard on Biodiversity Offsets, and the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Good Practice for Mining and Biodiversity;
4.
 T
o implement three core biodiversity 
management activities including Protected Area Plan, Reforestation Program and Species-level  Conservation Plans. PROTECTED AREA PLAN
Cobre Panama has committed to support 
three protected areas in the MBCPA. Following the incorporation of the Cobre Panama Foundation in 2019, Cobre Panama and Ministry for the Environment have now signed a long-term agreement to continue to support the protected areas around MBCPA. The areas are the Santa Fe National Park (72 636 ha), Omar Torrijos National Park (25 275 ha) and a protected area to be established in the District of Donoso and its coastal marine zone (> 150 000 ha). The main objectives of the protected area plan are:
•
 R
educe deforestation and subsequent 
habitat loss, in the area surrounding the 
Cobre Panama project; 
•
 C
onserve habitat for species populations 
that may be impacted by the project to ensure their long-term recovery from the Company’s direct impacts and their long-term viability;
•
 Co
mpensate for the loss of natural 
habitat (both temporary and permanent) in the project footprint.
•
 F
und and build capacity for the 
management of protected areas currently threatened by deforestation.
REFORESTATION PLAN
Cobre Panama has committed to reforestation of 10 475 ha (7 375 ha outside the mine footprint and 3 100 within the mine footprint) using three distinct programs.
•
 T
he Agroforestry Program focusses on 
providing benefits to communities, while 
also improving ecological conditions by increasing native tree cover. The program will focus on areas outside the mine footprint;
•
 T
he Ecological Restoration Program will 
conduct reforestation inside protected areas and other locations that can be 
permanently protected with the goal of restoring native forests with structural and compositional diversity. The program will focus on areas outside the mine footprint;
•
 T
he Footprint Rehabilitation Program 
will be focused on the stabilization and rehabilitation of the mining footprint. Clearing of the project footprint will occur over a number of years.
SPECIES-LEVEL  
CONSERVATION PLANS
Cobre Panama has committed to 
implementing a number of species level management plans. These have been developed with the aim of addressing the management needs of individual species for which the protected areas and reforestation plans may not be sufficient. Each species action plan describes a portfolio of actions aimed at ensuring a net positive impact on species viability. During the development and implementation of these species action plans, Cobre Panama is currently partnered with the following independent organisations: 
•
 S
mithsonian Tropical Research Institute 
(STRI) of Tropical Investigations (Panama 
Amphibian Rescue and Conservation) – assisted with developing facilities at two sites to provide for the long-term care and breeding of the four amphibian SoC;
•

WEST LUNGA CONSERVATION PROJECT
The 11 750 km2 West Lunga Ecosystem 
(WLE), situated in north-western Zambia 
encompasses the West Lunga National Park, Chibwika Ntambu, Musele Matebo, Lukwakwa and Chizela Game Management Areas. The area is important from both a hydrological and ecological perspective. The WLE forms the core of the Kabompo watershed which is the largest tributary of the Upper Zambezi and also feeds into the headwaters of the Kafue River system with extensive wetlands and floodplain habitat. From a botanical perspective, the WLE hosts up to a thousand species, of which over 50 are endemic. The area also supports large tracts of dry-evergreen Cryptosepalum forests, unique to this part of Zambia. The WLE once supported large populations of a multitude of large mammal species including elephant, buffalo, sable, roan, Lichtenstein’s hartebeest, lion, leopard and wild dog. Unfortunately,  most mammal species have been severely impacted by illegal hunting over the last  50 years and today remnant populations survive by hiding in the extensive forest. In addition to illegal hunting, the WLE faces a multitude of ecological threats from in-migration, commercial timber exploitation, unsustainable agricultural practices, encroachment and  poor governance.
In 2014, the Trident Foundation and the Zambia 
Wildlife Authority (ZAWA, now the Department of National Parks and Wildlife) developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to guide the implementation and execution of a project (known as the West Lunga Conservation Project ) to provide logistical, technical, financial and managerial support  for the WLE.Since the signing of the MoU, the Trident Foundation has invested more than  $5 million in conservation and wildlife activities through the West Lunga Conservation Project. The investment has primarily focused on supporting the Department of National Parks and Wildlife’s (DNPW) conservation management activities on the ground, which has included recruiting, training, equipping and paying wildlife rangers, vehicle maintenance and transport support, infrastructure development and communications. A number of conservation related livelihood programs have also been developed in surrounding communities including the creation of a Community Game Reserve in Ntambu Chiefdom, a honey out-grower program  and a Community Tourism Camp.
Discussions are ongoing to reach an agreement 
for the devolution of managerial control of some of the WLE’s protected areas to the West Lunga Conservation Project, in partnership with DNPW and Community Business Units. The overall objective of the various partnerships are to restore the WLE to its full ecological potential and create an environment where wildlife and conservation based economies can thrive. This will generate equitable benefits for surrounding communities that aim to reverse the trends of unsustainable land use and place a positive value on the preservation of the resource.
Revenue generation will be facilitated through 
community game ranching for the supply and sale of meat, tourism (consumptive and non-consumptive), honey production, and non-timber forest product value chain enhancements.Livelihood achievements include:
•

The THINK! Safety program is based on Crew 
Resource Management, the successful aviation safety program which focuses on teamwork, decision-making and communication. THINK! relies on problem-solving and is the embodiment of our Sensible Health & Safety strategy. It aims to enable and encourage critical thinking that is informed by our safety structures and processes. By combining knowledge with a common thinking process, we teach employees to take a sensible approach to risk management. 
The THINK! Safety program allows the Health 
& Safety Management System (HSMS) to be implemented across all operations by providing them with the guidelines and tools to meet our objectives.
FQML has additionally launched a Digital 
Assessment Management System called SafeHub to house FQML’s Health and Safety (Think!) training and communications content. SafeHub is an online repository providing users with access to all Think! related content in an organised and structured manner that saves users time, money and energy and provides access to the latest and most up to date safety content from across the organisation.
Training modules, toolbox talks, interactive 
games, posters, videos, and easy to roll out campaigns are all stored on SafeHub in multiple languages ready for use. This easy to search database will ensure FQML share knowledge and assist in improving safety on the ground by consistently ensuring we deliver impactful and engaging safety guidance to our employees.
THINK! SAFETY IN  
OUR COMMUNITIES 
The CSR program’s initiatives and activities 
are consistent with international best practices and are carried out in a systematic manner across all sites. Our programs are specifically targeted to ensure sustainable community development, environmental and biodiversity and human rights.
ROAD SAFETY AWARENESS
Approximately 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic incidents, and between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries. 90% of these occur in low to middle-income countries such as Zambia and Panama. FQML recognises this and is committed to educating the communities surrounding its operations through its Think! Safety program by empowering community members to recognise the dangers and take decisions to keep themselves and their loved ones safe.
AGRICULTURE
Kansanshi’s biggest project is converting 40 000 subsistence farmers into emerging commercial farmers which has been running since 2012. As part of the program, Kansanshi is also focused on educating farmers on best practices, including how to Think! Safety  and be able to work safely.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE & CRISIS MANAGEMENT 
COBRE PANAMA ERT
Cobre Panama has developed their “My Emergency Control” mobile application to co-
ordinate better their Emergency Response Team’s (ERT)efforts. By utilising the app, ERT is guaranteed more accurate data, which is crucial when trying to save lives. 
To support the team, Cobre Panama have also purchased a new state-of-the-art KME ARFF 
fire truck. This technologically advanced vehicle, which contains features like an integrated communication system, will increase ERT’s fire and rescue capabilities. Every second counts during an emergency and the KME ARFF fire truck will allow ERT to respond quicker and  
more efficient than ever before. 
TRIDENT’S AVIATION FIREFIGHTING 
EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM
In its quest to safeguard life and property 
around its mining operations and in communities neighbouring communities, FQM Trident Limited has partnered with the Zambia Air Service Training Institute (ZASTI) to train 14 Emergency Response Team (ERT) members in aviation firefighting.
The training conducted by ZASTI was in 
line with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) airport codes database, which is used in airline operations such as flight planning and air traffic control.
The 14 ERT members will be part of FQM 
Trident’s 24-hour emergency fire and rescue team, which was set up by the mining firm in Kalumbila to safeguard people’s lives and protect the growing communities near its operations, as well as the town airport.EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS SUCCESS
Emergencies can happen anywhere and at 
any time. The very nature of an emergency is unpredictable and can change in scope and impact. Being prepared and planning ahead is critical to protecting lives, the environment, and property. To this end, our Emergency Response Teams (ERT) and Crisis Management Teams train hard to ensure all team members are physically and mentally fit and able to make potentially life-saving decisions under extreme pressure.
This hard work and dedication has recently 
paid off with our Çayeli Bakir Mine Rescue Team in Turkey winning the inaugural Turkish Mine Search and Rescue Competition and our Kansanshi & Trident Emergency Response Teams coming first and second, respectively in the annual Zambia Inter-Mine ERT competition.SAFETYGRI 102-12, 403, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 413-1

Annual Inspection,  Review and Reporting First Quantum manages 19 Tailings Storage Facilities (TSF), 
of which 10 are active and 9 are closed. The Company takes the management of TSF and dams extremely seriously. All of our facilities are subject to close monitoring by site and group management as well as regular external audit. In addition to national legislation in the country in which the facility is built, all our TSFs have been designed and are operated in accordance with the guidelines issued by either the Australian National Committee on Large Dams (ANCOLD), the Canadian Dam Association (CDA) or the European Union Legislative Directives. 
In 2021, the company thoroughly reviewed the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) developed by the International Council on Mining and Metals. We support the standard’s intent to improve  
the industry’s performance on tailings management. First Quantum is committed to a phased approach in aligning our operations with the performance aspects  
of the GISTM in order to maintain our track record in tailings management.Operation

TAILINGS MANAGEMENTTSF DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION METHODS 
First Quantum’s Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs) are designed in 
accordance with the guidelines of the Australian National Committee on Large Dams (ANCOLD), the Canada Dam Association (CDA), and European Union Legislative Directives. The TSF guidelines used depend on the location and jurisdiction.
When determining the appropriate type of TSF for a project, it is important 
to consider local conditions and the physical and engineering properties of the tailings. Hard rock copper tailings typically settle, drain, consolidate and gain strength over time. Cyclones are used to separate the tailings into a coarse and fine fraction on the embankment during deposition. Preferential deposition of the coarser material from the cyclone underflow onto the embankment creates a free draining, competent and stable construction material while the fine fraction, and the majority of the water delivered with the tailings, flows towards the centre of the TSF. In this way, the embankment phreatic surface (level of saturation) is kept lower which helps to maintain embankment stability well above the lower design limit.
Based on these properties, First Quantum has adopted two main 
approaches to embankment design and construction using cyclone tailings, namely the upstream and centerline methods. These designs are industry best practice and used widely and successfully in  hundreds of mining operations around the world. However, regardless of the design and construction, it is imperative that the TSF is operated within the design constraints. First Quantum’s senior management  and its engineering staff work closely with the operators of each TSF  (i.e. each project) to ensure the facility is managed and operated  within the design constraints.
A third TSF construction method is used at our Cobre Las Cruces copper 
mine in Spain. At Cobre Las Cruces the tailings are dewatered using a filter press (12% moisture content) and transported by articulated dump truck to the TSF where the ‘dry’ tailings are placed.
The TSF construction methods used at our major operations, upstream 
at Kansanshi and Sentinel in Zambia and centerline at Cobre Panama are shown in the following illustrations.
In 2021, the Company thoroughly reviewed the GISTM. As a result, First 
Quantum has committed to a phased approach in aligning our operations with the GISTM. As part of the phased approach we have prioritized alignment with the core components of the GISTM.UPSTREAM
CENTRELINE
Coarser tailings from the cyclone underflow is deposited in a planned manner to continually raise the outer TSF 
embankment, whilst the finer tailings from the cyclone over flow is discharged from the created embankment towards a central decant pond. A minimum length of fine tailings beach above water is one criteria used to ensure an adequate foundation strength to support ongoing upstream raises. In this manner, the embankment crest line moves progressively inwards as the TSF develops. The rate of rise of the embankment is typically maintained at less than 2m per year to allow the beached fine tailings to desiccate and gain the required strength. This method of construction is used extensively around the world and within the First Quantum group. Properly executed, upstream construction can provide an economical embankment with a high factor of safety.
Centreline construction is where the existing embankment crest is maintained on the same centerline as the TSF increases 
in height. The majority of the coarser cyclone underflow is placed downstream of the crest centerline and is supported by natural ground that has been suitably prepared to provide a stable foundation. The balance of the coarse sand is deposited from the cyclone underflow onto the previously constructed fine tailings beach in a similar manner to upstream construction. Factors in selecting this centerline method may include higher tailings production rates, economically available material for embankment construction or site conditions are more complex to manage using upstream construction.KANSANSHI TSF 1  
Upstream construction using cycloned tailings.  The TSF was designed to have a rate of rise of less than 2m per year (and in practice is typically lower than this).
KANSANSHI TSF 2  
Upstream construction using cycloned tailings.  The TSF rate of rise is around 1m per year.
SENTINEL TSF  
Upstream construction over a 17 km long perimeter embankment. The TSF has a rate of rise of 2m per year.

We find strength in our differences. First 
Quantum's culture and success is founded on doing things differently. This means encouraging an inclusive and respectful environment where alternative and differing ideas and perspectives are embraced. We expect our people to speak up and challenge the established way of doing things to enable us to continually improve and develop as a Company. Our diversity allows us to recognize the distinct and different needs of those around us.
We operate in a heavy industry environment 
against very diverse cultural backdrops where women have historically had low representation. The ability to attract women into this environment can prove challenging, however we recognize the benefits that come with developing women to work in heavy industry and we remain focused on the importance of our training and development programs designed to improve the representation and advancement of women. Furthermore, concerted efforts are being made in recruitment, promotion, and developmental reviews to reduce the gender inequality gap as well as a focus on reviewing our internal metrics across the business to establish the capability to better measure, track and report on our progress.
As a Company with operations in 7 countries, 
and a presence in 17 countries, we play an important role in the economies of our host countries. The following breakdown of data aims to show the geographical representation of our workforce and our optimal use of available labour and skills within our host countries, with the aims of contributing to local employment and advancement of skills in our host countries. During 2021 our workforce consisted of 17 845 employees. INCLUSION

OUR PEOPLE
CULTURE
From the Company’s inception  
in 1996, First Quantum has grown to become one of the leading global producers of copper. We are immensely proud of our operations and our technical achievements  and also the culture that we have built and that characterizes First Quantum today.
We expect our people to think for 
themselves and we’re not afraid to give greater opportunities to our people who want responsibility.  With this we seek to give our workforce the chance to achieve their full potential by taking their skills and experience to the next level and the prospect of growing developing their careers.
OPPORTUNITY AND 
FAIRNESS
We treat our employees fairly and 
with respect. We promote inclusion and diversity in the workplace and strive to provide an environment that offers equality of opportunity, is free from harassment, violence and intimidation. Our employment policies adhere to domestic laws and are consistent with internationally accepted labour standards, including ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights – implementing the UN “Protect, Respect, and Remedy” Framework.
We pay competitive wages 
and benefits, which more than satisfy national legal standards or local industry benchmarks. In countries where no minimum wage legislation exists, we seek to establish a living wage equivalent that provides a good standard of living for our employees. In the absence of collective bargaining agreements, we regularly perform market benchmarking to ensure the competitiveness of our pay. Where fiscal circumstances of the host country may erode the standard of living, semi-annual pay reviews are also undertaken.
The use of misleading or fraudulent 
practices to recruit employees is prohibited and First Quantum conducts awareness campaigns to highlight this to the areas in which our workforce are based and where this is assessed as a potential issue.
CASE STUDY – KANSANSHI
At the Company’s Kansanshi mine, training and developing the potential future 
Zambian leaders doesn’t start at the mine gate. In 2021, Kansanshi invested more than $2 million across a wide range of initiatives targeting improved education and development opportunities in Zambia. These ranged from A-Level scholarships and graduate programs to trade schools providing students with the skills necessary to establish mining careers, through to employee study assistance programs and the General Managers programs aimed at the Company’s high performing employees. In 2021, Kansanshi provided the support for training and development of almost 300 students, 45% of them female.

The impact of the global pandemic 
has been different in each of the countries we work in. It has been in Zambia, Panama, and Mauritania where we have been most active in supporting and augmenting the government’s responses to COVID-19 as we support our host communities. In addition to increased medical facility resilience, initiatives at the mine clinics in Mauritania, Zambia, and Panama, COVID-19 protective measures to minimize person to person transmission in the workplace and protect business continuity have been implemented across all our operations.
PANAMA 
The Company has been very active in supporting 
the Ministry of Health of Panama, MINSA, with access and supplies into surrounding communities. 
Response of the Gorgas Memorial Institute for 
Health Studies, a medical research institution that has been dedicated for more than 80 years on investigating diseases in the tropics and preventative medicine in order to fulfill its role as a national public health laboratory. In April 2021, the Gorgas COVID-19 Institute was opened and now provides advanced genetic sequencing of Coronavirus samples to help track its mutation 
and spread in the country. Cobre Panama has also provided direct support, including emergency livelihood packages to support its surrounding villages and communities. 
In response to the pandemic, the Company 
developed the CobreSafe app, which has been recognised by Microsoft on its Customer Stores website, for our Cobre Panama workforce. This app enables COVID-19 health monitoring and improves workforce safety through traceability in real time of potential cases at the mine. 
COBRE PANAMA
Cobre Panama delivered 500 COVID-19 tests to the Miguel de la Borda Health Center to provide the health facility with the necessary supplies to detect possible cases of COVID-19 in the community. This donation was made through the Cobre Panama Contigo program.
Also, through the Cobre Panama Contigo 
program, transportation and logistical support was provided to voluntarily transfer residents of the neighboring communities in Donoso, Omar Torrijos and La Pintada to enable them to receive vaccinations against COVID-19. 
Cobre Panama Contigo is our health and safety 
program in response to COVID-19, whose objective is to protect our employees and our neighboring communities.
ZAMBIA
The company has provided testing and medical equipment, and assisted with the construction of COVID-19 isolation facilities for the community. Ongoing support includes the provision of 
oxygen produced by the Kansanshi Smelter which supplied oxygen as far as Lusaka as well as the neighbouring provinces. Furthemore, the Company provided essential consumables, face masks, sanitation stations, and transportation of medical supplies.
The Company is working with the Ministry of 
Health in the northwest province to provide vaccination stations to employees and affiliated contractors in support of the national vaccination program. 
KANSANSHI
When schools around our Kansanshi mine closed because of the threat from COVID‐19, the Kansanshi Foundation spearheaded the School‐on‐Radio initiative, a radio schooling program aimed at bridging the education gap among primary school‐going children.
Courses were delivered remotely via two FM 
radio channels. Teachers from around the region, broadcasted 12 hours a day, engaging some  42 000 students.
MAURITANIA
The Inchiri Health Department in Mauritania rolled out COVID‐19 vaccinations in regional areas, supporting communities who otherwise would not have access to the life‐saving vaccine. First Quantum provided essential logistical support to this important program by supplying 4x4 vehicles to allow medical professionals to safely access remote locations across the country, ensuring an equal opportunity  to healthcare for all.
COVID-19  
RESPONSE
The Company has also redesigned ways of 
working, with staggered rosters, remote working and bubble concepts on site to continue operations while limiting the potential spread. As cases are identified amongst the workforce, they are contained and isolated according to the established protocols and in coordination with local health authorities with limited impact to operations. 
The Company has focused on actions and 
campaigns to maximize vaccination rates and to plan booster vaccination campaigns for 2022. We continue to work with local communities to develop support processes and encourage vaccination. In response to the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic, First Quantum has maintained the health and sanitary protocols at our operations and local communities across the world. 
Our proactive response to 
COVID-19, in compliance with both local and international guidelines, is specific to each country. Our goal is to prevent or reduce the transmission of the virus on our sites and in local towns or villages in each region, while the health and well-being of our workforce and communities continues  
to be a priority.

LOCAL COMMUNITIESOUR APPROACH
Each of our sites has a community social and 
economic development plan which is aligned with the UN SDGs and the national development strategies for host countries. We seek to ensure that the positive economic impacts of mining are realized and to assist in improving the quality of life for those people and communities impacted by our activities. Plans are made according to legal requirements, community needs and business opportunity and risk. We are continually refining our social investment strategy to best address community needs, local workforce development, local business and infrastructure development in a manner that benefits communities. Through partnerships with government and civil society, we seek to ensure that the benefits of mining extend beyond the life of our operating sites, so that we leave a positive impact  on the national environment, climate change and social capital.
OUR PERFORMANCE
As part of First Quantum’s corporate social performance strategy we support host communities and governments, helping to tackle social challenges and collaborate on solutions that enhance growth and prosperity. We develop human and economic capital by providing jobs and skills training and by promoting local procurement. Furthermore, we build physical infrastructure and institutional capabilities thereby helping to create more resilient communities. 
The COVID-19 pandemic was particularly impactful 
on our local communities. Our community development programs had to pivot from supporting initiatives requiring group gatherings to providing remote and direct support. COMMUNITY

CONSERVATION FARMING
First Quantum organizes workshops to teach local 
farmers basic business principles and their application to high-value crop farming as a sustainable source of income. The goal of the project is to promote food security in the mine’s areas of operation while also enabling local communities to become economically independent. The conservation farming program is now in its 10th year of operation, helping nearly 40 000 farmers in Zambia provide for their families and their country. During 2021 the conservation farmers grew a record 9 200 tonnes of maize and as a result were able to invest more in improving their homes and furthering their children’s education.
DAILY MEALS AND NUTRITION
First Quantum has provided daily meals to about  7 700 undernourished schoolchildren, including 500 in early childhood development classes. This has led to significantly improved attention spans and an average 30% gain in academic performance. Under its School Improvement Program, the company is also supporting a Continuous Professional Development program,  where teachers are provided with training on modern teaching methods.
SCHOOL-ON-RADIO 
PROGRAM
The Kansanshi Foundation spearheaded the School-
on-Radio initiative, a radio schooling program aimed at bridging the education gap among primary school-going children which was a result of schools around our Kansanshi mine closing due to the COVID-19 threat. Courses were delivered remotely via two FM radio channels. Teachers from around the region, broadcasted 12 hours a day, engaging some 42 000 students. SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM
As Zambia’s largest private sector employer, we understand the importance of job focused skills training. Therefore, beyond public schooling First Quantum’s has established a scholarship program. Annually we sponsor about 150 students and interns in various trades and vocational training programs. Several recent classes have been 100% young women, as we do our part to address the gender imbalance in mining and secondary industries that support it.
LOCAL BUSINESS 
DEVELOPMENT
In addition to education development, local business 
development has been a key focus for First Quantum. Over 2 000 entrepreneurs in Solwezi were trained in 2021 in basic business development techniques through a radio platform hosted by Kansanshi Mining Plc and Fortune World Investments. These workshops, which were also run on social media, under the theme ‘Changing the Business Mindset’, aims to build employment capacity, enhance business growth and sustainability independent of mining activities as well as help formalise participants’ businesses. Whilst also enhancing small and medium enterprises (SME) participation in key sector value chains, which is critical to building economically independent communities in rural areas.
JIMUKA! PROGRAM
One of the factors that cause girls in Zambia to cut their education short is menstruation. For many girls without basic feminine hygiene supplies, they stay home for several days each month to avoid embarrassing accidents at school. As a result, they fall behind in their studies and in some cases give up on school entirely. First Quantum sponsors the Jimuka! program that provides girls with feminine hygiene products. The program also arranges motivational talks by successful female professionals and entrepreneurs, who serve as role models for young girls while emphasizing the value of education.40 000 9 200

As part of its ongoing commitment 
to bring fresh clean water to local communities, First Quantum has invested in two commercial boreholes for the Kisasa community, close to Sentinel.  The boreholes are 130 meters deep with two 32 000 litres, 15-metre high storage tanks, connected to a distribution network to 62 communal taps that will supply water to more than 8 000 people of Kisasa.
KASOMBO BRIDGES
The Trident Foundation has handed over two bridges in Chipawa village. The construction of the bridges, in collaboration with the community, on the Kasombo river commenced in 2020 after both the main bridge and the makeshift footbridge collapsed, posing a risk to community members. PANAMA
Cobre Panama has spent approximately $4 million on infrastructure development projects during 2021.
Projects achieved to date include:

MAURITANIA
BENICHAB PIPELINE
In Mauritania, First Quantum provides water to households and businesses in Akjoujt, which is home to approximately 15 000 people, as well as to residents of nearby deserts settlements through storage tanks from our Benichab pipeline.
This pipeline also aids nomadic livestock 
herders and people living in more remote villages around our operations. Our long-term goal, as the Guelb Moghrein nears closure, is to hand over all water infrastructure to the Government of Mauritania – after working to ensure that local officials have the necessary equipment and expertise to maintain it into the future.

RIGHTS
OUR PERFORMANCE
We have a goal of zero human rights violations  
by our Company and our contractors. In 2021 we  are pleased to report that we achieved that goal.  A comprehensive human rights impact assessment is embedded in our social impact management programs and our land acquisition and resettlement programs. These are documented in our Social Impact Assessments and Resettlement Action Plans as required by law. We will continue to promote human rights within our sphere of influence. This is especially important in the context of our support for the UN SDGs, as human rights serve as the foundation of the overall SDG framework.OUR APPROACH
First Quantum respects human rights, which means that we act to avoid 
infringing on the rights of others and commit to addressing impacts that occur as a result of our business activities. We believe that recognising people’s basic human rights and individual values – while respecting their diverse identities, individual values and points of view – is the key to empowering communities and inspiring self-sufficiency. 
While governments have the primary duty for 
protecting human rights, we recognize that we must respect human rights within our sphere of influence. We also recognize that we have an important role to play in promoting human rights among our stakeholders. Therefore, respect for human rights is fundamental to our Company values and how we conduct  our business. 
First Quantum upholds the rights of all people 
whose lives are touched by the business activities we’re responsible for – no matter where they live, and regardless of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or any other point of difference. We believe that no single right can be considered separately from the others, and that all people are entitled to a life free from discrimination and harassment.
Our approach to human rights is guided by 
internationally recognized principles and standards, including: 
•
 U
niversal Declaration of Human Rights 
•
 V
oluntary Principles on Security and Human 
Rights (VPSHR)
•
 I
LO Declaration on Fundamental Principles 
and Rights at Work •  U N Declaration on the Rights of  
Indigenous Peoples 
•
 G
uiding Principles on Business and  
Human Rights 
•
 U
N Protect, Respect and Remedy 
Framework 
We work to ensure that all relevant Company 
guidelines, systems and practices, including our security policies, are consistent with these international norms and in compliance with the laws of the countries and jurisdictions in which we operate.
First Quantum will only do business with 
suppliers, including contractors, who maintain zero tolerance for human rights violations and we may terminate a contract of any provider who breaches the law, the First Quantum Code of Conduct or First Quantum policies. All security service providers are required to abide by the VPSHR code of conduct and to quarterly certification declaring that they (1) induct and train all new employees on these principles and (2) monitor the adherence to these principles by their employees.EM-MM-210a.3, EM-MM-210b.1

HUMAN RIGHTSCOBRE PANAMA 
The resettlement plan for the Cobre Panama Project was 
developed through extensive stakeholder consultations. The resulting agreement was the product of good faith negotiations based on internationally accepted principles of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC). As of January 2017, all from Petaquilla community moved voluntarily to Nuevo Eden as per their resettlement agreement. Previously resettled communities have adapted to their new communities and are now successfully subsisting on their own farming outputs. Following the completion of the resettlement, the Company adhered to the IFC Performance Standard 7 recommendations that resettlement be monitored until year 3, and is now focused on the development and support of livelihoods through agroforestry, agricultural, eco-tourism and textile programs. The Company’s objective is to create the same number of jobs through these programs as the number of local employees working at Cobre Panama.
ÇAYELI 
Voluntary resettlement is ongoing at Çayeli as part of the Near Mine Housing Project. For a number of years local residents have complained that blast vibrations from the mine have damaged their homes. Expert studies were commissioned in 2013 and while no causation was established, heavy precipitation and naturally-occurring ground movement led to Çayeli undertaking a voluntary resettlement process for people living in damaged houses. To-date 93 households have participated in the process:  84 have been resettled, 5 have received formal offers and 4 are having their homes monitored for damage and monitoring is ongoing.HAQUIRA 
First Quantum has been engaging with communities influenced by the Haquira project in Peru since 2011. In early 2020, the Company commenced actual discussions on land rights and resettlement with the communities of Huanacopampa, Ccahuanhuire, Lahuani, Cconchaccota, Llamahuire, Ccarayhuacho and Pararani.  The Company has presented a proposal to each of the above communities and received counter proposals from all except Pararani. For the next two years, the focus will be on an exploration and drilling program to confirm the reported resources and to explore other potential areas. Negotiations regarding land acquisition will continue though progress is expected to be limited as the newly elected Peruvian government considers a new mining code. 
TACA TACA 
At Taca Taca in north-western Argentina, as part of an EIA, a communications plan has been designed and information meetings held with the populations closest to the project. We have commenced the process of FPIC as required by Argentine laws through the Secretaria de Asunto Indigenas, the ultimate authority on indigenous peoples. The Secretary issued a statement identifying three communities from whom FPIC should be sought: Olacapato, Pocitos and Tolar Grande, with the latter being closest to the concession area, 35 km away. Expectation of job creation from the mine has been identified as a priority for the local communities, however, the Company’s approach has been to encourage services and business’ not aimed solely at mining but also at tourism, as this has historically been the principal economic activity of these communities and with which there is commonality with mining in the types of key services required; catering, lodging, transport, medical services, clothing and mechanical services.SENTINEL 
Physical resettlement of 597 households and 1 631 
subsistence farmers is nearing completion at Trident in accordance with requirements set out in the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) approved by ZEMA. All project affected people received their agreed to and legally supported compensation and the process of compensation extended into the project commencement period on time prior to commencement of the mine’s development. Substantial structured stakeholder engagement meetings were held during the resettlement planning, implementation and ongoing during as part of follow-ups. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, physical engagement meetings have been affected and mostly done through electronic platforms,  but done in small groups for specific topics, as prescribed  by the Public Health Regulations, a situation well understood by our stakeholders. Acquisition of secured farmland for resettled households stands at 58.6%, with 247 households still not able to access the allocated land. Traditional governance structures are still reluctant to support the conversion of traditional land to land with full title for the resettled households. We remain committed to finding a mutually agreeable solution for all parties. Livelihood restoration, activities include training in entrepreneurship by adopting business idea stimulation, support initiatives and sustenance activities. Sustainable agriculture as a business venture for both crops and livestock has also been adopted as a sustainable livelihood restoration initiative and being implemented  starting with mind-set transformation activities. To enhance sustainable agriculture as a livelihood for resettled households, Conservation Farming Unit (CFU) has been subcontracted to work with individual households to stimulate the concept of farming for nutrition and for income, with the aim of identifying small scale agribusiness opportunities. Other community activities include education support, health support, wildlife management support and community infrastructure. The strategic approach comprises ongoing avoidance of dependence drivers with a focus on Corporate Social Investment (CSI) activities in order for interventions to outlive the mine life. Key pending resettlement obligations are construction of bathrooms and landfill cells that were suspended due to lack of sustainability but these activities shall be implemented within 2022 using an adjusted implementation model.KANSANSHI 
North Western Fence Extension: the Company intends to 
compensate and resettle all residents within the North Western Fence Extension area. The approximate 520 hectare area is within the modelled airshed of the Kansanshi Smelter. Kansanshi have recently been granted permission from the Royal Establishment and local Government to proceed in the community and disclose the project. This has initiated the Moratorium Resettlement Working Group formation.  An asset survey is planned to commence in 2022.
Sydney’s Corner : all families currently residing on a nine 
hectare piece of land known as Sydney’s Corner are currently being resettled. These communities have occupied this land illegally. Kansanshi has been working closely with the Solwezi council in this resettlement. A full asset survey was completed in 2021 and families have started moving off  the land.
BWANA MKUBWA 
Nine families down-gradient of the Bwana Mkubwa Mine are in the process of being resettled. All affected families have agreed to the resettlement terms which include a combination of negotiated settlements or full asset replacement packages. The Resettlement Action Plan is planned to be implemented in 2022. Bwana Mkubwa was sold to Shamrock Mining Limited on October 11, 2020,  who have assumed the environmental liabilities.

HUMAN RIGHTSINDIGENOUS 
PEOPLES
OUR PERFORMANCE
At the beginning of 2017, First Quantum 
completed a decade-long process to resettle several hundred people living near the Cobre Panama Project. Among those voluntarily relocating were two small indigenous communities, who moved from villages settled a few years earlier to new homes in the rainforest 5 km away. This resettlement was among the first to be carried out under the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 2011. A highly collaborative effort, the Cobre Panama resettlement has earned appreciation from indigenous leaders, international experts and the government of Panama and is seen as a model for successfully resettling communities through FPIC. As part of the Resettlement Action Plan an Indigenous 
Peoples Development Plan was developed and implemented. Three years into the plan, programs and support continue in  
partnership with government education, health and social development agencies. Engagement is ongoing.
With respect to cultural heritage at 
Ravensthorpe, there have not been any cultural heritage issues. Ravensthorpe has legally-binding agreements in place with each of the Aboriginal groups who have Native Title over the lands on which we operate, namely the Wagyl Kaip and Southern Noongar people of Albany and the Southern Nyungar people of Esperance, and has a strong history of compliance to the Heritage Protocols contained within those agreements.
Most recently in November 2019, a “Site 
Identification Aboriginal Heritage Survey of the Shoemaker Expansion Area and Straight Infrastructure Corridor” was conducted. This survey included representation from both the Wagyl Kaip and Southern Noongar people, the Southern Nyungar people of Esperance, an anthropologist, an archaeologist and Ravensthorpe. As a result of the survey both Aboriginal groups had no objections to Ravensthorpe progressing with their plans for the eastern portion of the Shoemaker-Levy expansion area and the straight infrastructure corridor Levy.
Where indigenous communities are present, we use our best efforts to respect their standing as 
distinct, self-determining peoples with collective rights.OUR APPROACHThe host communities at our Cobre 
Panama and Ravensthorpe operating sites include indigenous peoples.
COBRE PANAMA – CASE STUDY
In Panama, as First Quantum looked to develop the Cobre 
Panama project, our in-country teams engaged with the communities and affected people following the completion of the ESIA, building a relationship and understanding between all parties. This included with the Ngabe-Bugle indigenous people with whom FPIC was sought and received. The Ngabe-Bugle people self-defined the FPIC process which was completed and documented in 2017 and was subject to independent audited. All have houses which are self-designed, and all children have access to education, skills developments opportunities as well as healthcare, all of which they didn’t have before. An indigenous peoples development plan was also developed, that was also audited. 
The process was conducted in accordance with ILO 
Convention 169 and IFC Performance Standard 7, as required prior to major industrial development. 
Five years post completion of the plan and the families have 
successfully adapted to their new communities with their  own farms.
PRESERVING THE NATIONAL 
HERITAGE OF PANAMA
As part of the ESIA commitments, the Company is  
committed to an archeological monitoring and rescue program for Panama's cultural heritage.
Cobre Panama works hand in hand with the National 
Directorates of Historical Heritage and Museums, for  the conservation and exhibition of the findings. Cobre Panama sponsors a new virtual experience at the Museum  of Penonome highlighting 10 years of work safeguarding  the national heritage of Panama.

INDIGENOUS PEOPLESOUR APPROACH
At First Quantum we don’t see site closure as a one-
size-fits-all exercise. Each operating site is unique in terms of its geographical, social and ecological setting and our approach to closure reflects this local context. Our approach to site closure is therefore no different to our approach to site development, where specific risks are identified and appropriate controls are implemented. Closure related risk identification occurs long before site closure starts. There are a number of benefits to taking a long term approach. Firstly, a longer term plan using more reliable data is more likely to be successful, and secondly, many closure related liabilities can be addressed in the operational life of the site, significantly reducing the effort required after closure. 
A critical part of the closure process is the 
engagement with our local stakeholders. Our two most important stakeholders at our operations approaching closure are our employees and the communities who will remain in the area after the site has closed. The Company supports a transition to re-employment in different fields. Employees at sites approaching closure have been provided with opportunities to learn new skills or further their academic studies, allowing them to find work elsewhere. Where possible, a future land use offering local communities with new opportunities and livelihoods would always be a primary objective of ours. However, if the future land use does not offer opportunities, leaving a site which is physically, chemically and biologically stable is a non-negotiable requirement. In order to meet these requirements, the Company uses internal resources and globally recognised leaders in closure planning to help us plan. Closure Plans which present the most likely routes to a stable closure are regularly updated at all of our sites. 
In addition to actively planning for the closure of all 
of our current mining operations, First Quantum manages a number of closed sites in Canada. The Company has taken a similar approach to our operations in which all aspects of the process receive the appropriate resources to manage the risks identified and to move the site towards its objectives and future use. Our closed properties use a comprehensive approach that incorporates safety, environment, community, and cost factors to identify risks and establish site specific targets. As part of this process, the safety of our closed tailings storage facilities and dams are regularly reviewed by independent experts. Given that all of our closed sites are located in Canada we have adopted the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) protocols. During the external MAC verification of our closed sites in 2021, it was concluded that we met or exceeded a level (A) requirement for 96 of the criteria, resulting in a total conformance of an average of 83.5%.

hour (MWH) as it is consumed on site and converted  
to GJ in accordance with the abovementioned conversion factors.
PURCHASED ELECTRICITY 
• D uring the compilation of this ESG report the Electricity 
generation by source values were obtained from 2020 International Energy Association’s (IEA) World Energy Statistic, as the 2021 was not yet published. Where data was not available, it was assumed that electricity 
generation have a 50:50 split between coal and gas.First Quantum is committed to transparency and ongoing 
development of its Environmental, Social and Governance  (ESG) reporting in line with the expectations of key stakeholders. The following section outlines the methodology undertaken to compile the ESG report.
WATER
• H istorically water withdrawal, discharge and re-use is 
measured in accordance with the Water Accounting 
Framework (WAF) for the Minerals Industry of Australia (Minerals Council of Australia, 2014). However for 2021 First Quantum has chosen to align our water usage reporting to the ICMM’s Water Reporting Good Practice Guide, 2nd Edition.

UN SDG CONTENT INDEX
This content index supplements First 
Quantum's 2021 sustainability reporting suite, which includes the Annual Report, Environmental, Social and Governance Report, Tax Transparency and Contributions to Governments Report (Tax Report). 
Listed in the content index are GRI’s General 
Disclosures, Management Approach Disclosures and topic-specific disclosures for the relevant material topics reported. Where relevant references are also provided for the stipulated SASB Metals and Mining disclosures. In addition, references are made to specific SDG’s where disclosures are presented in line with covered in the “Business reporting on SDG’s: An Analysis of the Goals and Targets.
GRI has an established set of reporting 
principles which determines if a sustainability reporting has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards. These principles define the report content
(stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability 
context, materiality and completeness) and the report quality (accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness).  The Company’s sustainability information has been prepared and is presented in accordance with the GRI Standards “Core” application level, additional disclosures a have been included where the relevant data is presented within  the ESG report. The GRI reporting principles have been implemented as follows:GRI Reporting Principles Comment
Stakeholder Inclusiveness In 2020, First Quantum commissioned an independent review of the materiality of our environmental, social and safety disclosures. The review 
included an analysis of our existing disclosures, a priority ratings review and a disclosure gap analysis (ESG Report, page 10). We welcome feedback on our reporting and continue to engage with stakeholders in an open and transparent manner. 
Sustainability Context An overview of our Sustainability Strategy is provide on Page 6 of the ESG Report 
Materiality We have provided data for issues that our stakeholders and our company consider to be material. These issues are identified through regular engagement with internal and external stakeholders. Reporting on these issues helps to inform our strategy, governance structures, risk management, operational management and reporting metrics. First Quantum' Mtaeriliaty process is described on Page 10.
Completeness We believe that the ESG Report covers matters material to our Company.
Accuracy Information is presented both as qualitative responses and quantitative measurements. Measurements and responses are subject to internal review at various levels to ensure consistency and accuracy. Data is published once a thorough review process has been completed. Methodologies for reporting are updated when relevant, based on international frameworks (for example, emissions factors) or best practices for the metals and mining industry. 
Balance
Through our reporting we strive to increase our transparency and as such we report on topics that are material to our stakeholders.
Our report is developed with our stakeholder requirements and expectations in mind. We have presented information using a combination of high quality graphics and coloured text to ensure information is easy to read, interpret and understand. We are committed to the ongoing transparency  
and development of our sustainability reporting.
Clarity
Our report is developed with our stakeholder requirements and expectations in mind. We have presented information using a combination of high quality 
graphics and coloured text to ensure information is easy to read, interpret and understand. We are committed to the ongoing transparency and development  of our sustainability reporting.
Comparability We disclose information for the current year as well as historical data. When relevant, historic data has been restated i.e. changes in methodology, 
updated emission factors or changes in industry reporting best practices. This is made clear in our sustainability reporting.
Reliability The report is subject to extensive internal review by the site and corporate level teams compiling the data as well as by senior management.  
The approach and methodologies are documented and follow industry practice. Assumptions and calculations are widely discussed prior to publishing to ensure reliability.

Employee turnover rate percent 5% 24% 8% The voluntary turnover in 2020 was 2.9%, while the involuntary 
turnover was 20.9%. A significant reduction in the Cobre Panama workforce was required during 2020 due to Cobre Panama operations being placed on preservation and safe maintenance for much of the second quarter, as a result of a temporary suspension of labour activities order by the Panamanian Ministry of Health in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cobre Panama ramped back up to full production levels in August 2020.
