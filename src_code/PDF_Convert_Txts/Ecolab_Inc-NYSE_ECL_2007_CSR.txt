in a sustainable way. While it’s good to be green, we don’t think it’s enough. All products have some environmental impact — whether in their creation, use or disposal — and products labeled as “green” often address only one aspect of that impact. 
At Ecolab, we consider the total impact of our products and services, and design them 
to conserve water and energy, increase safety and reduce waste. We also believe that sustainability isn’t just about protecting the environment — it involves economic progress and social responsibility. Advancements in all of these areas are needed to protect essential  resources and preserve quality of life for future
 gener
ations.
Blue is the color of the sea and the sky — and for us, it represents a broader spirit of responsibility. It represents the Ecolab approach to sustainability. Because at Ecolab, we believe it’s good to Think Green. But it’s even better to Go Blue.

A Message from Ecolab Chairman, President and CEO
Making the world a cleaner, safer, healthier place is what we do, and continuing 
innovation in the way we run our business and serve our customers will be increasingly important as we deal with global challenges such as climate change and water shortages. Our Global Sustainability Principles outline our speciﬁ  c 
commitments in the areas of economic progress, social responsibility and environmental stewardship — and all three of these areas are critical to our future. 
Economic progress is important because a healthy society needs successful 
companies. The continued growth of our business allows us to create more jobs and opportunities for current and future associates and deliver economic value to shareholders. It also allows us to contribute signiﬁ  cant investments that increase the 
long-term
 vitality of our communities.
At the same time, successful companies need a healthy society. Things like quality education and equal opportunity are essential to a productive workforce. Efﬁ  cient 
use of resources, a safe work environment and ethical conduct all play a role in our long-term success. 
When it comes to the environment, Ecolab is a leader in designing products and 
services that help our customers conserve resources and run  their businesses  more  
efﬁ ciently. We’ve invested millions in research and development to create products 
and services that minimize our customers’ water and energy use, increase safety and reduce waste. 
Sustainable innovation is the right thing to do for the environment — and it’s also 
a sound business strategy. Our customers recognize that our
 offerings can help 
them meet their own sustainability goals, as well as reduce their operating costs.  
Furthermore, we’ve gained efﬁ  ciencies through our efforts to be sustainable in 
our own operations. In fact, improving the efﬁ  ciency of our manufacturing plants, 
conserving resources and reducing waste have yielded savings that have 
helped us offset other costs, such as the rising prices of raw materials.
We made a lot of progress in all three pillars of sustainability in 2007. We 
set our ﬁ  ve-year goal for reducing GHG emissions. We launched Apex™, a 
revolutionary warewashing system that will help our restaurant customers 
reduce their total environmental impact. We established a new Culture 
and Inclusion function to help us best utilize the different talents of our 
as
sociates, and our charitable giving totaled $7 million. 
We recognize that when it comes to sustainability, our work is never 
done. We will continue to look for ways to improve the sustainability of 
our operations — and to help our customers do the same — for many 
generations to come.

CLEANER, SAFER, HEALTHIER PLACE
At Ecolab, we know what we do is important. Food safety and preventing the spread of infection are 
critical to protecting the health of our customers and our customers’ customers. At any given time, 1.4 million people worldwide suffer from infections acquired in hospitals, and the ﬁ  gure continues 
to rise. Outbreaks of foodborne illness occur daily in all countries, from the least to the most developed. Diarrheal illnesses caused by contaminated food and water kill approximately 1.8 million people annually, and with most cases going unreported, the true extent of the problem is unknown. 
Helping to keep people safe and healthy requires cleaning and sanitation interventions on farms, 
in food and beverage processing plants, in restaurants
 and
 hotels, on cruise ships and airplanes, in 
schools and hospitals — the list is almost endless.
Every day, Ecolab customers use our products to:
y Wash over 250 million  dishes
y Wash over 75 million  hands
y Wash over 38 million  kilograms of laundry
y Clean over 13,000 kilometers of dairy pipeline
y Treat over 10 million  chickens to 
control salmonella
y Clean over 3 million hotel rooms
So why is it important for us to be sustainable?
As population, industrialization and pollution have grown, the worldwide renewable water supply 
per person has fallen. Nearly 2 billion people cope daily with the problem of ﬁ  nding enough water, 
and as many as 3.5 billion people — almost half the world’s projected
 population — could face water 
shortages by 2025. 
In recent years, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have been rising. World carbon 
dioxide emissions are projected to rise from 26.9 billion metric tons in 2004 to 33.9 billion metric tons in 2015 and 42.9 billion metric tons in 2030. Carbon dioxide is the most abundant human-caused greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. These human-caused carbon dioxide emissions result primarily from combustion of fossil fuels for energy. 
The most  recent ﬁ  gures from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report that Americans 
generated 251 million tons of municipal solid waste in 2006. Thirty-ﬁ  ve to 45 percent of waste 
came from schools and commercial locations, and approximately one-third of the total waste 
generated was made up of containers
 and packaging.  
Together, these facts make one thing clear: When it comes to protecting health and reducing environmental impact, Ecolab — along with our customers — can really make a difference.

Casual dining restaurants increase operational efﬁ  ciency by more than 15 percent
Casual dining restaurants that installed the Apex™ warewashing system, which 
includes a series of detergents and rinse aids dispensed through a controlled system that monitors usage and performance, were evaluated for water, packaging and energy savings. With the system tracking and recording rack counts and critical dishmachine readings, the managers were able to track water and energy consumption, detergent usage and waste — and then implement needed changes identiﬁ  ed by the Apex reports. Based on the number of racks of dishes washed 
per day, operational efﬁ  ciency for the restaurants improved from 39 percent to 
55 percent in a four-month period.

Ecolab is changing the way producers approach food safety by emphasizing the importance of 
comprehensive cleaning and sanitation from the beginning to the end of the process. Multiple interventions provide an innovative,  integrated and efﬁ  cient approach to helping our customers 
maximize food safety. 
The Ecolab Livestock Disease Intervention
® program is aimed at helping control cross-
contamination within and between animal production facilities, as well as between production 
facilities and processing plants. Ecolab also provides complete udder health, hoof management and ﬂ  y control programs for dairy production facilities to help ensure the safety of products for 
human consumption.
Additionally, several of our products are designed to help reduce pathogens and other microbial 
counts on food surfaces in
 the processing stage. These patented food surface treatments are 
effective solutions for minimizing microbial contamination during processing — improving the quality and shelf life of food products such as meat, poultry, seafood, fruits and vegetables. Other EPA-registered Ecolab solutions help prevent contamination by  sanitizing and disinfecting hard 
surfaces in food preparation facilities.
Ecolab’s food safety offerings also include a comprehensive set of solutions that help prevent the 
spread of foodborne illnesses  in restaurants  and retail locations. Ecolab products and services help 
improve employee hygiene practices, sanitize kitchen equipment used to prepare and serve food and sanitize every surface within a facility. Other solutions, such as color-coded cutting boards, utensils and food rotation aids, help prevent cross-contamination. 
Furthermore, our EcoSure
® Quality Assurance Audits help customers  establish a routine program 
o
f self-inspection, provide comprehensive employee training and identify areas in need of 
improvement to ensure that food safety best practices are properly implemented throughout 
an operation. Recent trends in global food production, processing, distribution and 
preparation are creating an increasing demand for interventions to ensure a safer global food supply. Healthcare-associated infections remain a leading cause of death and a ﬁ  nancial burden to healthcare 
systems worldwide, with drug-resistant bacteria making infection 
prevention even more critical.  
Ecolab regularly partners with governmental, industry and professional associations 
to support forums for discussion and promotion of food safety. We have won several prestigious awards for our work in food safety, including the Black Pearl Award for Corporate Excellence in
 Food Safety and Quality from the International Association of 
Food Protection (IAFP) and the North American Foodservice Grand Prix Award in the cleaning and chemical product category from the International Foodservice Distributors Association and the Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors. Leadership in Food Safety
6Ecolab Tsunami® 100 Approved for Organic Use
In 2007, Tsunami® 100, an Ecolab product for antimicrobial treatment of fruits and 
vegetables, was cleared for organic food processing uses by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Organic Materials Research Institute. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California Environmental Protection Agency expanded the product registrations to allow use on fruits and vegetables labeled as organic. Tsunami 100 can help organic processors  reduce the risk of dangerous  pathogens in process  
water and clean fruits and vegetables more effectively.PRODUCTS & SERVICES THAT PROTECT HEALTH
37280_2 CS2.indd   737280_2 CS2.indd   7 3/19/08   5:31:30 PM3/19/08   5:31:30 PMINFECTION PREVENTION 
In addition to protecting the food supply, our cleaning and sanitizing products 
help prevent the spread of germs and bacteria in schools, restaurants, hospitals, retail stores, hotels and other public places around the world. 
With healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) becoming a signiﬁ  cant and 
prominent concern, hospitals and healthcare facilities, in particular, need Ecolab 
more than ever. Ecolab offers system-wide solutions for healthcare facilities that help reduce infections, improve operational efﬁ  ciencies and, most importantly, 
improve patient safety. As a leader in infection prevention, Ecolab provides products and programs for infection prevention, sterile processing and the operating room. 
Our clinically trained healthcare experts can offer healthcare facilities the latest 
in innovative products and technologies; integrated clinical and support services; data
 utilization and process improvement; training and continuing education; 
quality assurance testing; thought leadership; and best practices. 
In 2007, we acquired Microtek Medical Holdings Inc. The Alpharetta, Ga.-based 
manufacturer and marketer of infection control products for healthcare and acute care facilities specializes in infection barrier equipment drapes, patient drapes, ﬂ  uid control products and operating room cleanup systems – furthering 
our efforts to provide comprehensive solutions to signiﬁ  cantly reduce infections 
and contamination in the healthcare environment.
7Hand Hygiene 
Compliance 
According to the U.S.  Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
one-third of all HAIs can be prevented through the implementation of a hand hygiene program — but hand hygiene compliance in healthcare facilities is reported to average only
 
20 to 50 percent. 
Dry skin and contact dermatitis 
caused by frequent handwashing are persistent problems for healthcare workers, which can reduce hand hygiene compliance and put them — and their patients — at risk for HAIs. In 2007, Ecolab introduced Endure
® Revitalizing 
Skin Lotion and Crème, a product line designed to improve moisture levels in the skin without compromising the antimicrobial beneﬁ  ts of other products or the 
efﬁ cacy of gloves used by 
healthcare workers. 
Also in 2007, we introduced a Hand 
Hygiene Compliance Monitoring Program for hospitals and healthcare facilities. The program provides a multi-interventional approach  
that combines effective hand hygiene products, a step-by-step  
implementation process,
 patient 
empowerment education and training materials, ongoing measurement and benchmarking to increase and sustain hand hygiene compliance.

healthy planet for future generations. In 1948, we introduced the ﬁ  rst rinse 
additive, reducing energy needed to dry dishes by speeding up the drying 
process. And it has been more than 25 years since we introduced revolutionary solid technology with Solid Power
®, the ﬁ  rst in a line of solid concentrates that 
increase  efﬁ ciency for our customers and can be shipped using substantially 
less fuel than liquid products. 
HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS 
CONSERVE RESOURCES
From concentrated, solid formulations to innovative packaging and dispensing methods, our 
products help increase safety, lower use of water and energy, and reduce chemicals and waste released into the environment. Because at Ecolab, we are
 committed to sustainability in our 
own operations — but we realize that the greatest contribution we can make to the environment reaches beyond that. It lies in helping each of our customers around the globe reduce their own impact on the Earth.
Our Comprehensive Approach
In our industry, “green” standards tend to focus on evaluating only one aspect of a product — often ingredients — rather than considering its total effect on the environment. Ecolab looks at the bigger picture. Our solutions are developed to provide the best results at the lowest total environmental impact. 
Our comprehensive approach to sustainability includes creating products that clean right the ﬁ  rst 
time. If customers don’t get great results in one pass, they have to do it again —
 using more product 
and more resources. We also design our products and services to work in ways that improve safety, 
reduce waste and use less water and energy. 
We have a strong history of developing solutions that help customers minimize their impact 
on the environment, and environmental savings continue to be key goals in our new product development process.TOTAL IMPACT OF OUR PRODUCTS & SERVICESECOLAB APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

Hotel chain achieves signiﬁ  cant environmental savings with Ecolab laundry program
An international hotel chain began using the Ecolab Formula 1® 
laundry program, which reduces the typical wash cycle, water 
usage and energy needed to heat the water. The system also combines all needed cleaning ingredients into one closed capsule that reduces chemical contact and is easy to transport and load.
Using Formula 1, the chain was able to reduce its hot water usage 
by 25 percent and reduce laundry cycle times by 12 to 18 minutes.

Less than 1 percent of the Earth’s total water is available fresh water; the rest is salt water, locked 
in ice or inaccessible. Global fresh water use tripled during the second half of the twentieth century, and as global demand increases, pressures on the world’s water resources are straining aquatic systems worldwide. Rivers are running dry, lakes are shrinking and water tables are dropping. 
From textile care to warewashing to vehicle care to food processing, Ecolab is continually developing 
better solutions that are more effective at reducing fresh water consumption. Innovations like no-rinse formulas, solid concentrates and effective formulations that require fewer wash cycles directly reduce the amount of water our customers use on a regular basis.

y Traditional conveyor lubricants for beverage processing require dilution on site and continuous application, resulting in high water usage, slippery ﬂ oors and slime formation on the conveyor system. The Ecolab DryExx
® 
conveyor lubricant system eliminates the need for water to dilute the lubricant, increasing safety  and resulting in savings in water and efﬂ  uent 
charges. A typical soft drink plant can reduce water consumption by more than 5.5 million liters and avoid signiﬁ  cant volumes of wastewater.
y Ecolab’s Aquamiser
® system for commercial laundries allows recovery 
and reuse of up to 45 percent of the water used in the washing process. The Aquamiser ﬁ  lters wastewater to remove lint, sand and other particles 
so the
 water can be reused and reduces the volume of wastewater 
discharged into sewers.
y To help ensure patient safety, healthcare workers have to clean and sanitize 
their hands between each patient visit. Quik-Care™ brand waterless hand sanitizer allows healthcare workers to sanitize their hands without water.

Reconditions Water to be Safely Reused
Poultry processor achieves 80 percent water savings
A poultry processing facility (processing 200 birds per minute) was using 1.4 million liters  (384,000 
gallons) of water per day — about 7.5 liters (2 gallons) per bird — with its I0BWs, used for high-pressure 
ﬂ ushing and cleaning, accounting for about 50 percent. 
Ecolab installed one of the lines with an Inspexx® IOBW system, which allows the water to be 
reconditioned and safely reused. The system complies with USDA water reuse standards and also offers savings in energy and labor.

Global energy consumption has risen by 56 percent since 1973 and is expected to continue to 
steadily increase over the next several decades, fueled by economic expansion and development. The need for health, education, ﬁ  nancial and government services will increase as populations 
increase, and commercial electricity demand is projected to grow with continued advances in technology and the introduction of new electronic appliances and equipment. Rapidly increasing growth in less developed nations will fuel additional energy demand.
In addition to monitoring and improving energy usage in our own facilities, we are committed to 
providing solutions and services that reduce our customers’ energy consumption and their carbon footprints. Products that are effective at low temperatures, solid concentrates  that can be shipped 
using substantially
 less fuel, and services that maximize operational efﬁ  ciency are all examples of 
Ecolab innovations that conserve energy.

 which can save a customer up to one month’s  w
orth of energy each year.  
y Our PERformance Plus™ laundry system combines Ecolab’s low-temperature washing process with our water and energy systems. The consumption of primary energy is drastically reduced through the effectiveness of the recycling systems, allowing disinfection at 60˚C and eliminating the need for steam in continuous batch washers.
Helping Customers 
Manage Energy
In 2007, Ecolab entered into a strategic partnership 
with Site Controls, LLC, a leading provider of energy management and business intelligence solutions, to provide energy management solutions to Ecolab customers. The Total Enterprise Control Energy Management System remotely monitors and controls heating, ventilation and air conditioning, lighting, signage and more — reducing customers’ energy usage by up to  10 to  20 percent.

Ecolab products are carefully designed to help people use them safely and effectively. 
When used as directed, our products minimize environmental impact and enhance worker safety.
We offer systems that feature color-coded products and controlled dispensing to 
simplify use. We help customers by providing programs that include educational videos, wall charts and manuals. We also offer training assistance for our customers’ employees to help with optimum and safe use of our products and provide a toll-free emergency telephone number on product labels. As shown below, the normalized rate of medical assistance calls is declining, indicating continuous improvement in customer safety.
Over the past several years, we have made signiﬁ  cant investments in our Material 
Safety Data Sheet system to provide up-to-date, consistent safety
 in
formation in many 
languages. The system was initially implemented in Europe and North America. In 2007, 
we expanded the system to support customers in Latin America, Australia, New Zealand and China.

Waste prevention is one of  the most  effective means of  protecting 
the environment, so our products are designed to use minimal 
packaging. When products and packaging are made with less material, less energy is needed to extract, transport and process raw materials and to manufacture products — and fewer materials are disposed in landﬁ  lls. 
Developing innovative packaging is just part of providing our customers with comprehensive solutions. We have led the industry with the introduction of water soluble, unit-dose packaging of detergents and sanitizers in the janitorial, institutional and food processing markets. This eliminates the solid waste generated by other forms of unit-dose packaging such as plastics, foils and paper. We have also reduced the amount of plastic
 introduced into the waste system by using ﬂ  exible pouches 
in place of rigid plastic bottles. 
We are committed to using renewable resource packaging, such 
as corrugated paper and paperboard, wherever safety is not compromised. Ecolab uses packaging material that is either recyclable or decomposes to non-hazardous end products. 
We have a program for the return and reuse of plastic drums and 
for the collection of smaller packaging for recycling. Every year, we clean and reuse more than 100,000 55-gallon drums, resulting in savings of more than 2.5 million pounds of virgin plastic resin. 
Our percentage of recycled plastic usage has declined as we 
continue to favor ﬂ  exible plastics over rigid plastic containers. 
Flexible plastic packaging is less conducive to incorporating
 
recycled plastic, but has a positive net impact on landﬁ  lling 
and can be produced using 75 percent less energy.

16Ecolab strives to use resources efﬁ  ciently in our manufacturing operations and to reduce 
waste to improve our environmental performance. We invest in improving energy efﬁ  ciency 
and conservation in our operations. We also minimize and seek to eliminate the release of 
pollutants that may cause damage to our planet’s air, water, land or inhabitants. In 2007, we achieved 5 percent reductions in both water and energy usage in our U.S.  plants, as 
well as a 17 percent reduction in wastewater discharge, while increasing our production. 
MANAGING OUR MANUFACTURING IMPACT
We continuously monitor the environmental, health and safety compliance standards of our manufacturing 
facilities around the globe. Internal and third-party audits lend integrity to the process and lead us toward a
 
more sustainable business model. 
Remediation Sites
Ecolab makes aggressive efforts to avoid pollution in our operations. We continue to work in cooperation with regulatory authorities for successful closure of the sites where Ecolab has been named as a “potentially responsible party.”
In 2007, Ecolab spent approximately $1 million worldwide on environmental remediation. Our environmental 
remediation expenses have related primarily to two categories: businesses acquired by Ecolab and accounted for in connection with the transaction or historic businesses divested years ago. 
EHS Compliance Auditing and 
Capital Expenditures
To enhance environmental, health and safety (EHS) compliance 
in our manufacturing operations, North American facilities are audited by a third-party consultant every other year. Similarly, in Europe and Asia Paciﬁ  c, an outside EHS consultant audits 
our
 plants. Audits  are performed  when facilities are acquired,  
and our property and  casualty insurers conduct ﬁ  re and worker 
safety  assessments  and pressure vessel  certiﬁ  cations at Ecolab  
facilities. These auditing programs  help us continually improve 
our EHS performance.
We have increased our capital expenditures for 
environmental, health and safety control projects as shown. Projects have included:
y Fire safety systems
y Electrical and other occupational safety items
y Spill containment and drains
y Water and air pollution control equipmentK?@I;$G8IKP<?J8L;@KJ

As required by the U.S. Emergency Planning 
and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), Ecolab facilities make information available about releases of EPA-listed chemicals to the environment. The primary chemicals reportable are formula components that evaporate during production. 
Global Process 
Improvements
In our manufacturing processes,  we are 
working to drive continuous reductions 
against four key metrics — water, energy, wastewater and waste. We have implemented robust systems to improve our performance at all Ecolab manufacturing facilities worldwide. Using the baseline information gathered, we are developing aggressive targets for reducing our environmental footprint.  
Safe Transportation 
of Goods
Ecolab works with national and international 
agencies to help craft future standards regarding the
 safe transport of goods and to 
ensure that Ecolab products are delivered to our customers safely.Energy Use
Ecolab strives to maximize the 
energy efﬁ  ciency of our products and 
services and minimize the amount 
of energy consumed in manufacturing our products. These efforts have a positive impact on proﬁ  tability 
and help preserve nonrenewable energy resources. 
y   Our plants primarily perform 
blending and packaging and use 
less energy than traditional chemical manufacturers.
y   All of our facilities are looking at 
ways to reduce the amount of energy they use.
y   Our corporate headquarters are 
heated by renewable resources, and reduced electricity used by 10 percent from 2005 to 2007.'()*+,.

Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization  
Act (SARA), also known as the Emergency Planning and  
Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) under section 313  
requires manufacturers to submit a TRI (toxics reporting  
inventory) form every year to EPA detailing the amount of  
certain toxic chemicals emitted or disposed of during the  
preceding year.AISE Charter for Sustainable Cleaning
In Europe, Ecolab has committed to the International Association for Soaps, 
Detergents and Maintenance Products (AISE) Charter for Sustainable Cleaning. This voluntary initiative is a life-cycle-based framework that goes beyond current legislative requirements to drive the industry toward
 c
ontinual improvement in terms 
of sustainability. In 2007, Ecolab was audited versus the challenging AISE Charter Entrance Check, and passed with an outstanding score of 91 percent averaged across all criteria.

Ecolab is committed to reducing our carbon footprint. To manage risks from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
and identify cost-effective reduction opportunities,  we’ve joined the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) Climate Leaders program. Through the program, we’ve committed to the following:
y Developing a U.S. GHG inventory of the six major greenhouse 
gases and reporting progress annually based on detailed EPA 
protocols and guidance.
y Developing a corporate GHG Inventory Management Plan 
based on a detailed EPA checklist to institutionalize the inventory process.
y Setting an aggressive corporate-wide GHG reduction goal to 
be achieved over a ﬁ  ve-year period. 
This year, we completed comprehensive measurement and evaluation of our GHG emissions in
 the U.S. The U.S. GHG emissions 
from our direct and indirect energy uses total approximately 200,000 metric tons for our baseline year of 2005. With the lessons  learned from this evaluation, we are planning to begin 
measuring our global GHG emissions footprint. 
In this report we are announcing our goal: Ecolab will reduce U.S. 
GHG emissions by 15 percent per ton of production from 2005 to 2011. To achieve it, we are focusing on our two largest GHG emissions categories — ﬂ  eet ground transport and our facilities for 
manufacturing, headquarters, research and development and other facilities in St. Paul, Minn. We have developed an energy and GHG reduction program for our facilities and will be moving toward more fuel-efﬁ  cient vehicles
 and vehicle service routes, as well as less 
GHG-intensive fuels when feasible.'%)*

ISO 14001 Environmental Management System
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 environmental 
management system is a voluntary system for managing environmental aspects of business operations, somewhat similar to the ISO 9001 quality system. This sought-after designation is granted to organizations that work to prevent pollution, conform to legal requirements, minimize impact on the environment and continuously improve  
environmental performance. 
We are in the process of establishing a new European headquarters in Zurich, 
Switzerland, and have achieved ISO 14001 certiﬁ  cation for our new facility. 
Currently, 42 percent of Ecolab facilities worldwide are ISO 14001 certiﬁ  ed.Ofﬁ cial 2007 numbers will not be available until mid-2008.

Ecolab’s production and distribution processes  are not energy-
intensive in comparison with many other industries, and our 
sensitivity to climate change is relatively low. However, we see climate change as an important issue that merits measurement  
and a long-term action plan. We support a balanced approach to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while sustaining economic growth and competitiveness, and we strive to reduce GHG emissions while continuing to provide our customers with exceptional products and value. We base all GHG-reduction strategies on sound science, objective engineering and the best available economic information. 
Ecolab will reduce U.S. GHG 
emissions by 15 percent  per ton of 
production from 2005 to 2011.THE IMPACT OF ECOLAB

diverse group of talented associates who are professional, reliable, trustworthy and honest. We are united by our dedication to every facet of the Ecolab Culture — spirit, pride, determination, commitment, passion and integrity.CONDUCTING BUSINESS RESPONSIBL Y
20THE CODE OF CONDUCT
We maintain a clear, ethical standard of conduct: Business will be conducted in accordance with the law 
and stated corporate and societal standards of conduct. Our associates are held to the highest standard of integrity and are expected to avoid situations that conﬂ  ict with our company responsibilities.
The Ecolab Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines designed to be read and followed by every associate in every location
 around the world. Available in printed form and translated into more than 25 languages, the Code of 
Conduct can also be accessed  online  at www.ecolab.com/investor/governance. 
Our annual certiﬁ  cation process asks associates to certify that they have read the Code of Conduct and 
whether they are aware of any possible or actual violations of the Code. In 2007, we added a new training feature to help associates recognize potential violations in common, everyday situations.
Since 1996, Ecolab has had a Code of Conduct Helpline for associates who need assistance or wish to report 
a possible violation. In 2008, we are expanding and improving the Helpline to better meet the needs of all our associates around the globe. The new Helpline will be answered 24 hours a day, seven
 days a week by an 
independent company that provides interpretation services in up to 150 languages and protects conﬁ  dentiality 
when requested. As before, the Helpline number is toll-free throughout the world.  
ETHICAL SOURCING STANDARDS
Our Ethical Sourcing Standards represent a global supply chain initiative to require our strategic suppliers to protect the health, safety and human rights of their associates. Suppliers must meet standards for forced labor, child labor, health and safety in the workplace, fair pay, harassment in the workplace, diversity and ethics and environmental policies. We require that our suppliers identify and act swiftly to eliminate any unacceptable conditions or practices in their facilities. 
37280_2 CS2.indd   2137280_2 CS2.indd   21 3/19/08   5:32:00 PM3/19/08   5:32:00 PM21Awarded for the Way We Do Business
Being a responsible corporate citizen has always been an 
integral part of our operations. We conduct business fairly and ethically, and we require our suppliers to do the same. We are committed to supporting our associates and giving back to our communities. In 2007, we received the following recognition for the way we do business: 
y For the eighth consecutive year, Ecolab was honored to be 
named one of the “100 Best Corporate Citizens” by  
 CRO 
magazine (formerly Business Ethics  magazine). Ecolab is one 
of only 11 companies to make the list every year since the 
list’s inception. 
y Ecolab was named one of the “World’s Most Ethical 
C
ompanies” by  Ethisphere magazine. The fundamental 
criteria used to measure companies examined ethical leadership and corporate social responsibility — which are both integral to the way we do business. Fewer than 100 companies were chosen for this award. 
y We received further recognition when Chairman, President 
and CEO Doug Baker was named among the “100 Most 
Inﬂ uential People in Business Ethics”  by 
Ethisphere. The 
100 Most Inﬂ  uential People were indexed against a series of 
criteria to measure their performance, including business and thought leadership, corporate culture and design 
 and sustainability. 
y We also earned ninth place on 
“America’s Best  Big Companies 
Honor Roll.” The honor roll 
r 
ecognizes 21 companies
 that have 
consistently appeared on Forbes 
magazine’s annual list of the 400 best big companies in America — also known as the Forbes Platinum 400. 
y For the fourth consecutive year, 
Ecolab was named to Selling Power’s  
list of “The 50 Best Companies to 
S
ell For” among the largest sale s 
forces in the United States. Ecolab was ranked third on the list, which uses key metrics including compensation, training and career mobility. 
y E
colab was recognized by 
the Minneapolis-St. Paul Business Journal as one of the “Great Places to Work” 
in
 the Twin Cities, the home 
of our global headquarters, for the second year in
 a 
row. Rankings were based on a survey of employees conducted by Quantum Market Research and the Business Journal.

promoting an environment where all associates can make a difference and be heard, supported, developed and rewarded for their contributions.SUPPORTING OUR ASSOCIATES
22TRAINING AND EDUCATION
Ecolab offers job-speciﬁ  c technical and skills training, as well as leadership development and 
associate development training opportunities, on a corporate-wide level. A tuition reimbursement 
program is also available to all U.S. associates. We utilize the Talent Pipeline as the foundation for our talent development efforts at Ecolab. The Talent Pipeline includes a talent development and performance management framework for associates, with Individual Development Plans designed to  
prepare associates for current and future opportunities. Aimed at helping associates take an active role in their own development, the Talent Pipeline includes training and tools focused on building the right skill sets to accomplish both personal and business goals. 
COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS
We feel strongly that our associates are what drive our success. Our  pay for performance 
c
ompensation policy provides associates the opportunity to earn salary increases higher than 
the market average, and our employee stock purchase plan offers associates the opportunity to personally beneﬁ  t from Ecolab’s growth.  
Associate beneﬁ  ts programs are designed to provide associates with ﬁ  nancial security and work-
life balance. We offer healthcare, vacation and holiday time, ﬂ  exible spending and dependent care 
accounts, life insurance, disability, 401(k) savings and an employee assistance plan. We also provide a rich beneﬁ  ts package to U.S. associates who work part-time.
In 2007, we began covering 100 percent of costs of preventive care for associates and their families covered by the U.S. medical plan, in addition to paying for special Well Baby programs to support expecting
 and new mothers. We also offer disease management programs in which nurses are 
assigned to provide expertise in managing treatment for cancer, coronary artery disease, diabetes and other chronic conditions. 
Ida C. Koran Trust
Thanks to the signiﬁ  cant generosity of Ida C. Koran, 
Ecolab’s ﬁ  rst associate, current and former Ecolab 
associates worldwide can obtain ﬁ  nancial assistance 
for their children’s education. They also have a place to turn when they face ﬁ  nancial hardship 
due to disabilities, medical problems, catastrophic and other unforeseen situations and when they seek treatment for chemical dependency. The fund was started in the late 1960s with $250,000 and is currently valued at approximately $40 million. 
37280_2 CS2.indd   2337280_2 CS2.indd   23 3/19/08   5:32:10 PM3/19/08   5:32:10 PM23ASSOCIATE SAFETY PROGRAM
Ecolab actively promotes and pursues a 
safe work environment for all associates. Our goal is to eliminate controllable associate exposures to accidental injury and to conditions that may adversely affect the health of our associates. The Associate Safety Program has been implemented to provide guidelines for industry best practices and includes safety training, personal protective equipment, accident prevention and accident investigation. In addition to the written Ecolab Safety Handbook, we maintain safety information and resources as part of our intranet site.  Ask Doug
Through our intranet site, we 
maintain an e-mail link called “Ask Doug.” This link gives our associates a way to contact Ecolab Chairman, President and CEO Doug
 Baker with 
questions, concerns and suggestions. 
In 2007, Mr. Baker received an 
average of 17 e-mails per month through this link from associates around the world, and each associate received a personal response from Mr. Baker.
ASSOCIATE INVOLVEMENT
In 2007, we introduced a peer grievance process (Peer Review) in four of 
our manufacturing facilities. Peer Review is an alternative dispute resolution procedure used by associates when they feel they have been treated unfairly or inconsistently. Approximately 90 associates attended a half-day training program to learn to serve as Peer Review panelists. Approximately 10 associates at each location were involved in drafting and designing the Peer Review procedures for their site. We have plans to extend the program to other facilities in
 2008.)'

established a Culture and Inclusion function focused on introducing new perspectives, initiatives and programs to accelerate our progress toward a more diverse, inclusive and productive culture. We are in the midst of a discovery process to more fully understand our associates’ perspectives as we develop our inclusion strategy. The discovery process will involve many associates through interviews and surveys. The goal is to determine how we can best utilize the different talents of our associates and how a more inclusive culture can positively impact our ability to grow.  PROMOTING DIVERSITY
24ASSOCIATE NETWORKS
Ecolab has several associate networks established to support 
diversity and inclusion. Each of these networks has an associate-driven council and receives corporate ﬁ  nancial support. 
y   E3 is a women’s network whose mission is to provide resources for women associates that encourage personal and career fulﬁ llment through individual mentoring, focused skill set 
training, community involvement and group camaraderie.
y EcoMondo is an international network whose mission is to support growth through the integration and development of global talent and to support and promote cultural diversity and global talent mobility.
y EcoEssence is a network whose mission is to recruit, develop and retain African and African American associates. 
y In 2007, a new network
 called PLAN was formed for 
professional administrative assistants. 
PURCHASING FROM 
DIVERSE SUPPLIERS
To promote sustainable growth across different sectors,  
Ecolab supports small, women-owned and minority-owned 
businesses in a number of ways. We’ve created partnerships with existing suppliers to enable us to provide the maximum practical opportunity for  those  businesses  to offer products 
and services to Ecolab. We are active in the Minnesota Minority Supplier Development Council and the Joint Committee Initiative, organizations designed to further opportunities for small, minority-owned and women-owned businesses.  
We’ve employed an outside consulting ﬁ  rm to certify 
the categorization of these suppliers to ensure accurate reporting of performance. 
Additionally, we participate in an annual job and 
procurement fair for small, minority-owned and women-owned
 businesses,  and we require that at least one diverse 
supplier be included in the RFP process for all RFPs with an annual value greater than $100,000. 
In 2007, our U.S.  purchases  from small businesses  totaled  
approximately 11 percent; purchases from minority-owned 
businesses totaled approximately 7 percent; and purchases from women-owned businesses  totaled  approximately 2 percent of purchases.

SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIESEcolab is committed to helping our customers achieve cleaner, safer and healthier 
surroundings so they can more productively conduct their business around the globe. We take the same passionate approach in our commitment to society. Ecolab promotes the well-being of associates, customers and shareholders by contributing to the quality of life in the communities in which we operate. 
CHARITABLE GIVING 
Ecolab has a strong history of 
contributing to communities where our associates live and work. 
We believe it beneﬁ  ts the economic and 
social vitality of these communities; we 
believe this also enables us to attract the talent we need to continue our business growth and development. 
Over the past 10 years, Ecolab has 
contributed more than $36 million
 to our 
communities. We sustained this strong giving tradition in 2007 by contributing $7 million through Foundation, corporate and in-kind giving.<:FC89=FLE;8K@FE

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
Ecolab fosters volunteerism and community service, enhancing the health and well-being of our communities by active outreach and involvement. We believe that success is measured not only by the satisfaction of our customers, but also by the contributions of our associates to the communities where they work and live. 
Ecolab encourages and supports the thousands of hours of volunteer work our associates commit 
to charitable organizations. By offering matching grants to organizations where Ecolab associates volunteer as board members, mentors and in other capacities, hundreds of thousands of dollars were 
donated in the last ﬁ  ve years. Along with our monetary 
support, we annually conduct charitable drives for blood, clothing, food, school supplies and holiday gifts for our community partners. Ecolab also
 provides in-kind 
product donations for cleaning and sanitizing solutions during times of natural disasters. In 2007, we donated over $100,000 worth of products for the ﬂ  ood relief 
efforts in southeastern Minnesota and to rescue workers at the Interstate 35W bridge collapse site in Minneapolis. Additionally, in partnership with Minnesota Computers for Schools, Ecolab donated 28 pallets of computers and computer-related equipment to be refurbished and donated to Minnesota schools.

For the past 20 years, the Ecolab Foundation has awarded grants through its Visions for Learning program, 
which encourages and rewards individual teachers for their creativity in classroom teaching. The goal of the program is to provide additional opportunities to motivate and challenge students, raise their achievement levels, and increase their understanding of school and its connection to life. 
In 2007, associate committees at 13 U.S. locations helped allocate approximately $680,000 through more  than 
230 grants to public and private K-12 schools in their areas. These grants provided classroom aids such as U.S. 
and world maps for a classroom near Beloit, Wis., physical science and chemistry curriculum enhancements for a school near the Greensboro, N.C., plant, and science concept
 software for a school in St. Paul, Minn.   
COMMUNITY GIVING CAMPAIGN
Another well-established program is Ecolab’s Community Giving Campaign. In 2007, the campaign was expanded beyond our 13 major locations to include all U.S. associates. Through the campaign, Ecolab associates contributed $700,000 to charitable organizations nationally and internationally including Community Shares, Global Impact, United Way and many other non-proﬁ  t organizations. Combined with 
Ecolab Foundation contributions, total donations equaled $1.2 million.
Corresponding “Week of Caring” volunteer activities were also expanded nationwide, and associates around 
the U.S. donated their time to help local charitable organizations in addition to raising money.
Making a Difference
The American Heart Association 2007 Twin Cities Start! Heart Walk   
Ecolab associates participated in the American Heart Association’s 2007 Twin Cities Heart Walk in St. Paul. The event promoted health and wellness and raised funds to help combat heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular illnesses. Ecolab Chairman, President and CEO Doug Baker served as the campaign chair for the walk. More than 700 associates walked, raising $186,000 for the American Heart Association. In recognition for our efforts, Ecolab was awarded a regional leadership award at the American Heart Association’s Annual Heart Walk Conference.
 
Retiree Volunteer Program
In 1987, a handful of retired Ecolab associates formed a committee to set up events to 
socialize and volunteer in local community activities.
 T
he outings became so successful 
that Ecolab launched a Retiree Volunteer Program in May 2007. The program’s mission is to assist our retirees in making a positive impact within our communities and, in 2007, they logged more than 250 volunteer hours. The program’s initial focus is on St. Paul and the surrounding area, with the goal to expand the program in the future.
Rhino Ark
In East Africa, Ecolab supports Rhino Ark, a Kenyan charity set up to help conserve 
the Aberdares National Park and the demarcated forestry areas which make up the Aberdares Conservation Area. Ecolab’s contributions help Rhino Ark toward its mission of protecting and conserving the Aberdares habitat and preventing illegal exploitation of the forest habitat wherever it is threatened.

Irish camp lets seriously ill children relax and have fun
Barretstown is a camp in the foothills of Ireland’s Wicklow Mountains where children with cancer and other 
serious illnesses  go for activities and adventure designed to rebuild their conﬁ  dence, self-esteem, trust and 
courage. The medical world calls it “therapeutic recreation.” At Barretstown, they call it Serious Fun. 
Each year, Barretstown must ﬁ  nd €4.5 million to serve up to 1,500 children from Ireland and 22 other 
European countries. The charity relies almost entirely on contributions to fund the camp – a challenge that 
gets harder every year.
THE IMPACT OF ECOLAB
“By providing us with our cleaning product requirements and pest prevention program, Ecolab is reducing our cost base substantially in this area. This gives us more money with which we can serve even more children, and sadly, the demand is always there. We are enormously grateful to Ecolab for the support – it is making a positive difference to the extraordinary children and young people we serve.”
Elaine McSweeney, Gift-in-kind Coordinator, Barretstown
