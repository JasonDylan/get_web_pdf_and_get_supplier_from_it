to mark a time of 
significant	change	for	our	
business. As we settled 
into our new corporate 
headquarters in Chicago’s 
historic Merchandise Mart, 
we made great strides to 
become a more focused, pure-
play company. We continued to reshape our company and portfolio of brands. This included 
divesting two businesses, as well as acquiring 
two more. We also successfully completed the spin-off of our Lamb Weston potato business and emerged as a new company – Conagra Brands.
With a new, streamlined focus on our business, 
we also took a fresh look at our corporate 
citizenship approach. This included an update of 
our materiality assessment. First completed in 2015, the assessment looked at the issues most 
material to our company and our stakeholders on 
social, ethical and environmental fronts. Given the changes within the company and evolving external interests on social and environmental topics, our 
assessment needed an update. The refreshed 
materiality	assessment	reflects	our	current	business	strategy and stakeholder dialogues. We continue 
to highlight Better Planet, Good Food and Stronger 
Communities as our focus areas and we’ve also added a new Responsible Sourcing focus area. More information about our efforts around these four 
focus areas can be found throughout this report. Along with our refreshed Materiality Assessment, 
we’ve also reestablished our Citizenship Steering Committee. Made up of cross functional leaders throughout the company, the Committee oversees 
our citizenship strategy and drives meaningful 
change within the organization. Given the amount of change our business saw over the last few years, 
it was important to reestablish this group which 
now has a fresh and reinvigorated focus on our citizenship approach. As we evolve as a company, so too, should our citizenship efforts and goals. 
Our employees are at the heart of these efforts 
and each year I’m amazed at their commitment to further advancing our citizenship goals. Our 
annual Sustainable Development Awards continue 
to be one of our cornerstone events for driving sustainable change within the organization. 
Traditionally our Lamb Weston employees had 
been strong contributors to the awards so I was especially pleased this year when we received 
a record amount of entries with an even smaller 
employee base. That means our participation in these awards continues to grow and I’m heartened by the innovative approaches our 
employees identify to make meaningful changes. 
Additionally, we had record participation this year 
during our annual month of service. With close to 
100 different projects across the nation and in a handful of other countries, Conagra employees rolled up their sleeves and gave a hand to their 
communities. I joined 70 employees in Omaha to volunteer at the Food Bank for the Heartland 
where we sorted fresh produce and packed meals for the food bank’s backpack program. It was amazing to see what kind of impact we 
could make in just a few hours. In total, more than 
2,300 employees logged close to 7,000 hours of volunteer work over the course of the month.  
While our company has gone through much 
change over the last few years, our commitment to citizenship remains the same. We believe that 
great food comes from companies that have an 
unwavering dedication to doing what’s right for all, which means giving back to communities, sourcing ingredients in a responsible way and 
being a caretaker of the environment. I invite 
you to learn more throughout this report.

Our citizenship strategy is overseen by our most 
senior executives, governed by our senior leadership 
team, developed and managed by a cross-functional 
management team, and embraced and implemented by our nearly 13,000 passionate employees. 
Our Board of Directors’ Nominating, Governance 
and Public Affairs Committee regularly meets with management to review internal and external factors and relationships affecting the company’s 
reputation, including social and environmental 
issues. This committee is composed of independent Board members, none of whom is or has ever been 
employed by Conagra Brands. 
Since becoming a focused, pure-play company, 
Conagra Brands has made quite a few changes to 
its footprint and business. The sustainability issues 
and opportunities we face have impacts across all functions of the company. To shape our evolving Citizenship strategy, we have a newly appointed 
cross-functional team of key leaders and subject 
matter experts in key functional areas to serve as our Citizenship Steering Committee. Guided by our refreshed materiality assessment, the Citizenship 
Steering Committee is reviewing Conagra’s overall 
sustainability strategy, goal setting, programming and reporting priorities at a company level. 
Our employees’ engagement provides the passion, 
enthusiasm and innovation to embed corporate responsibility into the fabric of our company.  
By volunteering in our communities, participating 
on our plants’ Green Teams and collaborating on cross-functional sustainability projects, our employees bring our citizenship ambition to life. OUR CITIZENSHIP PHILOSOPHY AND FOCUS AREAS 
The people of Conagra Brands make everyday food in extraordinary ways. That means making food that’s delicious, safe, nutritious and convenient, while collaborating with others like farmers, suppliers, 
customers and people who love our food. We’re looking forward to making good food for generations 
to come, and doing so in a responsible way that creates stronger communities and a better planet.We’ve built our citizenship strategy around four focus areas that articulate our values as a responsible corporate citizen — Better Planet, Good Food, Responsible Sourcing and Stronger Communities. 
Better Planet
The health of the planet and availability of natural resources is intricately linked to every 
part of our business, so we’re focused on 
taking action on climate change, preserving water resources, and eliminating waste.Good Food
We want nothing more than to make safe, delicious, affordable and nutritious foods 
while providing the information you need 
to make choices for a healthy lifestyle.
Responsible  
Sourcing
Purchasing ingredients and materials is about 
more than just cost and quality. Responsible 
sourcing means considering environmental, social 
and economic impacts across our supply chain. Stronger  
Communities
Creating shared value with our community of 
employees, investors, suppliers and business 
partners — as well as the places where we live  
and operate — is critical to our long-term success.

WHERE IT MATTERS
During	fiscal	year	2015,	we	completed	a	robust	materiality	assessment	process	
to identify, assess, and prioritize the environmental, social and governance 
issues relevant to the food industry, our business, and stakeholders. In 2017, 
we	refreshed	our	materiality	analysis	to	reflect	current	business	strategy	and	stakeholder dialogues. This refresh process uncovered additional opportunities to focus on the importance of socially and environmentally responsible sourcing, 
resulting in a new strategic pillar for Conagra Brands. Today, our materiality 
matrix	identifies	21	topics	across	four	strategic	pillars:	Better	Planet,	Good	Food,	Responsible Sourcing and Stronger Communities.
Our Citizenship strategy is deeply rooted in this holistic and objective view into 
what issues matter most.A LOOK ACROSS  
OUR VALUE CHAIN
Understanding the impact of our business throughout the life cycle of the food we make is critical to developing a comprehensive approach to citizenship. 
This view offers insight into where issues matter most, while also helping 
to	prioritize	where	we	need	to	influence	performance	outside	of	our	direct	control. For example, by collaborating with farmers, suppliers, contract manufacturers and outside transportation networks, we are developing 
innovative	ways	to	improve	supply	chain	efficiency,	while	providing	greater	
value to our customers and more sustainable products to our consumers.

environmental issues that are most material to 
our business: climate change, water resources 
and waste. We also believe that collaborating with others to manage these issues is critical to creating a sustainable global food supply. Climate change 
affects agricultural industries throughout the world 
and is fundamentally changing how we manage energy use in our facilities. The availability of clean water is essential to how we prepare food and 
critical to the farmers that grow our raw ingredients. 
Preventing waste — particularly food waste — is an important measure of our operating efficiency 
and an emerging social and environmental issue. 
Our sustainability goals outline measurable objectives for the next several years. Through our passionate employees and programs such as our Sustainable Development Awards 
and Zero Waste Champions, we’re striving to 
eliminate waste of all kinds – energy, water and materials – to improve the efficiency of our operations and make the planet a better place. 
The sustainability goals addressed in this section 
were created in 2014. Since selling our private label business in early 2016 and spinning off our 
Lamb Weston potato business in November of 
2016, our current business has a much different footprint than when these goals were created. We are in the process of reviewing our current 
business operations and creating adjusted goals 
that will be shared on our website and in future Citizenship Reports. Data shared in this section has been adjusted to remove private label and 
Lamb Weston data to more accurately show the 
year-over-year progress of our current business. 2020 SUSTAINABILITY GOALS:

Awards program continues to be the cornerstone 
for engaging employees, recognizing innovations 
in sustainable production and business practices. This internal awards program calls on employees to submit projects with imaginative approaches to 
sustainability such as conserving water, reducing 
waste, and improving energy efficiency. The awards drive engagement across all levels and challenge teams to collaborate in new ways. 
This year’s awards conference brought together 
representatives from almost all of our facilities to meet with one another, share best practices and 
celebrate the great work they are doing. Awards 
were given in four categories: 
• Climate Change & Energy Efficiency
• Water Conservation & Wastewater Management
• Waste Reduction & Recycling
• Sustainable Business Innovation  
Winning teams received grants for sustainability-focused public service projects in their community. Not only did the projects have a major 
environmental impact, but they also saved the 
company more than 5 million dollars.CONAGRA BRANDS’ SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AWARDS PROGRAM

The Ecomaniacs, our Sustainability Employee 
Resource Network, is comprised of employees 
passionate about the environment who are working 
together to raise awareness and change behavior for the good of our business and planet. This year, The Ecomaniacs piloted the Hefty Energy 
Bag program at our Omaha, Nebraska corporate 
campus. The program provides an opportunity to keep plastics you can’t recycle out of landfills by collecting them and turning them into a source of 
energy. The orange, eight-gallon bags can be filled 
with candy wrappers, plastic straws, cereal pouches, foam ‘take-out’ boxes, and many more items. The 
Omaha-area began this program in September 
2016 and Conagra Brands was the first corporate office to take part. The Ecomaniacs worked to promote the program by engaging employees 
through a Lunch and Learn, passing out bags to 
local residents, and educating community members during Earth Day Omaha in the spring of 2017. The team also unites employees in celebrating 
Earth Day and America Recycles Day with 
environmentally-focused volunteer activities such as tree planting, community gardening, and trail-clean up events at locations throughout the company.
Conagra Brands’ sustainability 
efforts continue to evolve year-over-
year. We’re driving engagement 
across all levels of employees at multiple locations, while challenging 
teams to collaborate in new ways.

As outlined in our global Environment, 
Occupational Health and Safety Philosophy 
statement , signed by CEO Sean Connolly in 
2015, Conagra Brands is dedicated to making 
great food in an environmentally responsible way. To further demonstrate our commitment 
to complying with environmental laws and 
regulations and to protecting natural resources, we have also created and educated employees on five environmental and sustainability policies: 
Environmental, Compliance, Climate Change, 
Water Stewardship and Resource Conservation. 
Compliance with federal, state and local 
environmental laws and regulations provides the foundation for our sustainability programs. Through the implementation of a robust Environmental 
Management System, we proactively manage 
environmental issues and share best practices among our facilities around the world. Furthermore, compliance is routinely assessed through 
internal environmental audits. When compliance 
issues arise, our team of environmental professionals works closely with the affected facility to educate and develop effective action 
plans and track findings to resolution.
In fiscal year 2017, Conagra received nine 
Notices of Violation (NOVs) and paid a total of 
$264,140 in environmental fines. Out of the nine 
NOVs, we paid financial penalties associated with three. Eighty-five percent of the total cost 
of environmental fines was from one significant 
violation associated with a program of a facility acquired by Conagra in 2013. Each NOV is assessed to determine any opportunities to 
prevent or mitigate the situation going forward.

CONTENTS        OVERVIEW        BETTER PLANET        GOOD FOOD        RESPONSIBLE SOURCING        STRONGER COMMUNITIES        ABOUT THIS REPORTBETTER PLANETClimate change remains one of the food 
industry’s most significant environmental 
challenges, impacting our agricultural supply 
base, potentially threatening our water supply and fundamentally altering growing regions. Agriculture is highly dependent on specific 
climate conditions — such as temperature 
and precipitation — determining the viability and yield of crops. Though understanding the specific effect on our food supply is complex — 
mired in variability and uncertainty — climate 
change has the potential to fundamentally change how we source ingredients. These 
issues, combined with efforts to transform 
transportation and industrial sectors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make climate change an issue that must be addressed 
today to build resiliency in the future.
Our management approach
 
Our greenhouse gas management program is 
founded on an understanding of facility-specific 
emission sources to enable strategic decisions 
regarding reduction opportunities. Because about 94 percent of Conagra Brands’ GHG emissions result from natural gas and electricity use, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy efficiency are linked. With a very 
diverse product portfolio, there’s a wide range 
of energy required to prepare different foods.  For example, it takes far less energy to put 
Orville Redenbacher’s
® popcorn seeds in a 
bag than it does to steam peel and can our Hunt’s
® tomatoes. This kind of insight allows us 
to make strategic decisions about where and how we focus our resources. We know that 
steam, compressed air and freezing systems are energy intensive, so we look for opportunities in facilities with one or more of these systems. 
   
We report progress towards annual GHG emission reduction goals to our operations leadership team as part of our monthly business 
reviews, along with other sustainability metrics. 
Progress towards these goals is included in operations leadership, plant management and 
other key individuals’ performance appraisals.ENERGY USE

in Rensselaer, Ind., reduced more than 390 metric tons of greenhouse gas after an AMD sustainment 
event prompted them to improve a conveyor system. 
The previous system was noisy, frequently jammed, and caused yield loss on the line. By removing six 
conveyor and drive assemblies and four vacuum 
pumps, the site reduced energy usage while packing cases more efficiently. In addition to saving more than 576,000 kilowatt-hours of energy, the reliability 
of the line has been improved.

Our Hunt’s tomato facility in Oakdale, Calif., 
discovered large greenhouse gas savings hidden  
in inefficient steam traps. Performing an analysis  
of the steam traps throughout the facility, they  found 37 steam traps with opportunities to impact  
efficiency through improved maintenance.  
Replacing the malfunctioning steam traps saved  
more than 10,000 decatherms of natural gas resulting in 545 fewer tons of greenhouse gas emissions.

Scope 3 GHG emissions where:  
• Data is reasonably available
• Emission factors are accurate and based on sound science
• The value and insights gained from the information outweigh the 
costs of gathering the data
Keeping valuable by-products out of 
landfills reduces emissions, too
Beginning in fiscal year 2012, we put rigorous 
systems in place to track landfill and material diversion data from all of our facilities, using more than 15 descriptive categories that are aligned with 
the Environmental Protection Agency’s Waste 
Reduction Model (WARM).  This tool enables us 
to better understand the lifecycle GHG emissions 
associated with how we manage these materials, 
allowing us to quantify benefits of finding the highest-value home for them outside of landfills. During fiscal year 2017, we estimate Scope 3 GHG 
emissions associated with sending waste materials 
to landfills to be 15,550 metric tons. Diverting 81.7 percent of materials from landfill avoided 131,520 metric tons of Scope 3 GHG emissions. *Upstream transportation & distribution
Farm-to-fork transportation and storage of raw 
materials, ingredients and finished products contribute to the total lifecycle environmental footprint of our food. Our reported transportation 
data include those that Conagra Brands influences 
directly. This primarily includes transportation used to move finished products to customers’ 
distribution centers, though there are some 
exceptions when we manage the transportation of raw ingredients. Currently all of our transportation is contracted, and the emissions of those vehicles 
are categorized as Scope 3 GHG emissions in 
accordance with the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
We are working aggressively with our transportation 
business partners, distributors and customers 
to improve transportation efficiency and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. We rely on a variety of contracted transportation services including rail cars, intermodal, trucks and ocean 
freighters to meet the inbound and outbound 
transportation requirements for our food. Conagra Brands is focused on improving the efficiency of every mode of transportation it uses.SCOPE 3 GHG EMISSIONS
By repurposing or 
recycling what used to 
be thought of as waste 
into ‘by-products’, we’ve avoided more 
than 131,520 metric 
tons of GHG emissions from landfills.

transportation strategy focuses on improving 
efficiency in three ways. First, we are continuously 
improving pallet efficiency by optimizing package size and orientation to fit the most products on each shipment. Second, we evaluate available modes of 
transportation and seek to use the most efficient 
method. For example — though still a small part of our transportation footprint — we’ve increased the amount of product moved using intermodal 
transportation by more than 20 percent compared 
to fiscal year 2008. Lastly, our contracted carriers are continually upgrading their fleets to improve 
efficiency, including trucks equipped with battery-
powered auxiliary systems and aerodynamic fairings. Combined, these efforts ensure we’re moving our products in the most efficient way possible, reducing

for approximately 80 to 90 percent of U.S. consumptive water use, our suppliers and contracted 
growers depend on the availability of clean water to grow crops and produce the ingredients  
needed for making our food.1 Our own facilities rely on access to clean water to operate, prepare 
food on a commercial scale and ensure that our equipment meets or exceeds food safety  
and quality standards.
Our management approach 
Our water resource strategy guides how we actively 
manage water resources across the value chain 
and factors in both water use and water quality. Having a very diverse product portfolio, there’s a wide range of water used to prepare different 
foods. Therefore, our facilities water use reduction 
goals vary based on opportunity. For example, some of the foods we make — such as peanut 
butter — requires very little process water. Others 
are much more water intensive, either in food preparation or sanitation requirements. This kind 
of insight allows us to make strategic decisions 
about where and how we focus our resources. 
In fiscal year 2017, Conagra Brands decreased 
its total water use by 26.5 percent compared to 
fiscal year 2008. Our water intensity — the water we use per pound of production — decreased 
by 7.8 percent during this same period. WATER CONSUMPTION

facility’s Green Team — a key group of employees that lead sustainability efforts within the plant 
— tested his theory of unnecessary water use 
in the kitchen’s tube-in-tube cooling system that makes sauces for many Conagra Brands foods. 
He determined that cooling sauces as part of the 
food-making process wasn’t necessary, prompting the facility to close a water valve that was used for cooling in the system and conserved more than 
132,000 gallons per day of water.

IMPROVE WATER CONSERVATION
Conagra Brands’ Marshall, Mo., facility realized 
it wasn’t necessary to use potable water when cleaning wastewater screeners in their Wastewater 
Treatment Plant. By installing a centrifugal pump 
along with required piping, the plant began using greywater to clean the screeners. This low-capital 
solution had a high impact: they were able to 
maintain the same quality of cleaning for the screens, while saving 5.4 million gallons of  
water annually. 
5.4
million gallons of water

needed to quench the steam and prevent that 
area of the facility from becoming too warm. After a simple plumbing change, the team was able to 
eliminate the steam issue and conserve 2.8 million 
gallons of potable water annually. The improvement also reduced natural gas use by 184 decatherms annually.

partnered with Nalco to dig into its wastewater 
pretreatment process. Wastewater operators 
previously made chemical adjustments for the dissolved air flotation (DAF) tank manually. 
Because wastewater chemical usage could vary 
from operator to operator, an automated process was developed and replaced the manual chemical adjustments. This means 37.5 tons fewer chemicals 
used per year while increasing the ability of the DAF 
unit to remove contaminants from wastewater.
3 7. 5
tons of wastewater  
chemicals reducedWater-related risks can be particularly threatening 
to the food industry, with a global supply chain 
intensely dependent on the availability of clean water 
to grow ingredients. Managing water risk is critical to Conagra Brands’ long-term business success.
Growing water scarcity is a the leading challenge 
for sustainable development in the U.S. and around the world. The UN FAO projects that irrigated food production will increase by more 
than 50 percent by 2050, but the amount of 
water withdrawn by agriculture can increase by only 10 percent - provided that practices are 
improved and yields increase.
1 And according to 
the EPA, the frequency, intensity, and duration of drought events are increasing in many areas 
of the U.S. This pattern is expected to continue, shifting outside of historical trends and making forecasting our water quality and supply more 
difficult.
2 These realities prove that managing 
water risk is an integral part of business planning.
Conagra Brands has responded to the CDP 
Water Program  since its inception. Our publicly 
available responses provide information to the global marketplace on investment risks and opportunities associated with water risk.
For the past seven years, we’ve mapped each of 
our facilities against areas of watershed stress. Since fiscal year 2014, we’ve utilized the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, 
which considered twelve key indicators of water 
risk to create global overall water risk maps. Risk indicators include: overall physical risk (quantity & quality), baseline water stress, inter-annual variability, seasonal variability, flood occurrence, 
drought severity, upstream storage, groundwater 
stress, return flow ratio, upstream protected land, regulatory & reputation, media coverage, access to water and threatened amphibians.
 
Starting in fiscal year 2016, we began to use the Food & Beverage weighting profile provided by the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. This weighting 
scheme reflects risks and challenges experienced 
by the Food & Beverage industry and additional weighting is given to specific risk categories based on relevance to our industry.
Overall water risk results from the tool show  
42 percent of our facilities as low to medium risk,  
55 percent as medium to high risk, and three 
percent as high risk. These three high risk locations represent just over three percent 
of our total annual direct water use.
Despite the fact that much of our water use is 
from facilities located in areas of low to medium 
water risk, effectively managing water resources — both in terms of water use efficiency and wastewater discharge quality — is one of our top 
sustainability priorities. In the years ahead, we 
plan to take our analysis beyond the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and leverage knowledge of local watersheds and regulatory environments 
to better understand our risk exposure.DIRECT WATER RISK EXPOSURE

of sustainability. It is socially unacceptable 
that 42 million Americans — including 13 
million children — live in households that are food insecure. Meanwhile, about 21 percent of the waste stream in the U.S. is 
food. In fact, more food reaches landfills and 
incinerators than any other single material in our trash.
1 These issues are compounded 
when we consider the resources required 
to grow, transport and prepare that food. 
And lastly, the economic losses associated with waste of all kinds, particularly wasted food, are simply not good business. 
Our management approach 
We are working to systematically and strategically reduce the amount of waste we generate in our 
facilities to capture the maximum value of the 
materials we buy. For unavoidable waste, we work hard to keep them from ending up in landfills. Nearly 
all solid waste generated at our facilities consists of 
food and packaging materials, much of which should be more aptly characterized as “byproduct” instead of “waste.” By reframing the way we talk about 
these materials, we can begin changing attitudes 
and behaviors in our facilities to make even greater gains in our waste reduction efforts. For fiscal year 2018, each of our plants has an individual waste 
reduction target that will help us on our Zero Waste 
journey. This annual waste diversion percentage goal keeps us on our path to zero waste-to-landfill in the midst of dynamic business changes.For each of our facilities, we track landfill and material diversion data monthly, using more than 15 descriptive categories. With this detailed waste 
characterization, our teams have insight on where 
the biggest opportunities exist. Our continuous improvement program — based on a “zero loss” philosophy — drives maximum use of our material 
resources. We are working hard to identify sources 
of waste throughout our facilities and practices and seeking out ways to reduce that waste at the source. 
For example, we’re reducing waste through improved 
yields, first pass quality, strategic production initiatives and better design. Facility Green Teams — comprised of cross-functional, salaried and 
hourly employees — are also critical in leading 
waste reduction and recycling programs. These teams have proven effective in enhancing recycling efforts and identifying opportunities to reduce 
waste at the source. Their efforts are supported 
by plant management and operations leadership, with direct assistance provided by the corporate 
sustainability team, Enterprise Procurement, 
and other functions. We report progress towards landfill avoidance and waste reduction goals to our operations leadership team as part of the 
period review, along with other sustainability 
metrics. Progress towards these goals is included in operations leadership, plant management and other key individuals’ performance appraisals.ELIMINATING WASTE

WASTED FOOD1. Source reduction
Preventing food waste before it is 
created is the best thing we can do 
for the planet and our business.
In fiscal year 2017, our Menomonie, Wis.,  Swiss Miss
® facility put together a team to tackle 
loss and waste throughout the plant. The site is 
already a Zero Waste Champion, with a 95 percent 
diversion rate, but five additional projects eliminated 173 tons of food and packaging waste. Projects included eliminating 50-pound bags of sugar in favor 
of a bulk method, saving 1,000 pounds of packaging 
material. Additional projects included reducing food waste during Juicy Gels, Tapioca Pudding, and Swiss Miss hot chocolate canister production. This 
continued focus on waste shows the team dedication 
to not only diverting, but also reducing waste.Food losses and waste make up a large portion 
of the solid waste and by-products generated at 
our facilities. Causes of waste are things like yield losses during production, excess inventory of discontinued products or ingredients, and products 
that were made that didn’t meet our high quality 
standards. Because organic materials degrade in landfills and generate methane, a potent greenhouse gas, keeping these materials out of landfills 
is a core component of our waste and climate 
strategies. Aligned with the principles of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Food Waste Recovery Hierarchy , Conagra Brands strives to 
redirect food waste to its most beneficial use.
3. Feed animals
Ingredients that cannot be used to feed people may be used to feed animals. The Green Team at our Peter Pan peanut butter 
facility in Sylvester, Ga., recognized the value 
that still existed in peanut skins and pieces which could not be made into our peanut butter. Peanut skins are a high-value animal feed which 
naturally are removed during the peanut roasting 
process. Small improvements were made to help improve the collection process and increase 
the amount captured. The team’s focus helps 
divert 2,000 tons of peanuts to animal feed per year and avoids sending food to landfill.4. Industrial use
Fats, oils and grease should be rendered into biofuel, where possible. Conagra Brands peanut butter facility in Streator, 
Ill., focused on finding another use for food and 
packaging waste to improve its overall diversion rate. Peanut oil is used as part of sanitation and is consistently produced as a waste stream. After using 
the oil, it is shipped out and turned into biodiesel 
and diverts 75 tons of waste from landfill per year.2. Feed hungry people
If our products or ingredients cannot be sold, donating to those in need is the next best thing.
Our Slim Jim facility located in Troy, Ohio, has 
partnered with Forgotten Harvest, a Detroit-based food rescue organization, since 2011 to find use for Slim Jim ends. These ends traditionally 
could not be packaged into finished product 
and were landfilled prior to our partnership. By creating a process to capture these pieces, they are repackaged for distribution to feed hungry 
people. Based on the success of the donations, 
the site began to donate school lunch pizza which did not meet internal quality standards. 
In fiscal year 2017 alone, the site donated 
492,000 pounds of pizza in addition to 503,000 pounds of meat snacks to Forgotten Harvest.
5. Composting
Turning food into a valuable soil amendment.  Conagra Brands has two frozen foods facilities 
in central Missouri, which were searching for an 
alternative vendor to handle their food waste. The Green Teams and facility employees did not want to landfill the food and were interested in exploring 
different options. They began composting their 
food waste which was a great, local option for both sites. These efforts helped turn approximately 3,000 tons of food waste into a soil amendment.

How important is our packaging? In addition to 
delivering safe, great-tasting food to consumers, 
it provides nutritional information, preparation 
instructions and in many cases, convenience and portion control. Packaging shape and design helps identify our brands, making them easier 
for consumers to find in stores and enhancing 
the overall experience with our food. Packaging preserves freshness, extends shelf life and provides important protection to help avoid food 
waste from spoilage or damage. With so many 
food options and formats offered across different sections of the store, we use a large variety of 
packaging materials — from corrugated boxes 
and paper-based cartons to plastic containers and metal cans — to perform all these functions.
Understanding that the materials we use must 
first meet food safety and consumer performance requirements, we are committed to continually improving our packaging to produce the best 
environmental outcomes for the total system. Our 
2020 Vision for packaging focuses on minimizing waste throughout the complete product and package system. We strive to use the right amount and the 
right kind of packaging for the job. Packaging can 
be part of the solution to avoiding food waste both in the home and throughout the supply chain. We 
constantly look for ways to use packaging more 
efficiently and effectively without compromising consumer value. After all, we recognize that people buy our products to enjoy our food, and we 
are committed to giving them the best possible 
experience, with packaging as an enabler.
Our Research & Development (R&D) team 
is responsible for delivering these results, 
while ensuring that our packaging meets the needs and expectations of our customers and consumers. We use lifecycle thinking and industry collaboration to evaluate the impacts of packaging materials and formats from sourcing, 
manufacturing, delivery and consumer use through 
end-of-life. To assist in making more sustainable decisions when developing new food and processes, Conagra Brands has invested in lifecycle modeling 
tools for both packaging and product design, 
to help us more accurately visualize the impact of our products throughout their lifecycles.

Packaging can be a part of the solution to 
reducing food waste at home. By offering 
consumers the right portion for the job at hand, excess food headed towards the landfill can be eliminated. In fiscal year 2017, Conagra Brands 
launched Hunt’s
® Recipe Ready Tomato Paste 
pouches. Smaller than its canned counterpart, the tomato paste pouch provides just the right amount 
needed by the average home cook. It’s estimated that this packaging innovation could save up to 2.2 million pounds of wasted paste if consumers 
who typically use only one serving switch from 
a canned version of tomato paste to the single serve pouches.  
Up to  
2.2

Peter Pan with less plasticEvaluating new packaging technologies and 
partners is crucial to ensuring we are using the 
most efficient and effective packaging methods. By partnering with a new supplier with different jar making technology for our Peter Pan peanut 
butter jars, we could use less plastic per jar. Even 
small reductions like this add up and helped us reduce our plastic use by 600,000 pounds in fiscal year 2017. Additionally, our new supplier 
was located closer to our Peter Pan plant which 
reduced the number of miles the jars traveled before reaching our plant to be filled with  
peanut butter.

pounds of plastic reducedUpdate on the discontinuation of bisphenol-a and vinyl in packaging
In recent years there has been an increasing 
amount of consumer concern around the use of Bisphenol-A (BPA) in the coating systems of food products that utilize metal packaging. While the 
company and regulatory authorities continue to 
stand behind the acceptability of BPA for these uses, as a response to these consumer concerns, we have committed to discontinuing the use of BPA 
from the food-contact linings in all of our packaging.
On July 30, 2015, we announced the discontinued 
use of BPA in the linings used for our cans across 
the entire portfolio, including all canned Hunt’s,
® 
Ro*Tel,® Chef Boyardee® and Van Camp’s® 
branded products. Continuing our attentiveness 
to consumer concerns, we also discontinued 
the use of vinyl containing liners throughout our entire consumer packaging. The company also on occasion may need to source products from 
contract manufacturers that do not have non-BPA 
liner capabilities. If this occurs, we attempt to source the minimum quantity of products necessary until a longer term non-BPA or non-vinyl option is identified. 
Through a strategic partnership with The Ardagh 
Group, we’re delivering on our commitment to discontinuing the use of BPA and vinyl in our 
coating systems. By transitioning to a new, 
two-piece can technology, we’ve transformed steel can packaging to both eliminate BPA coatings and reduce packaging use.

Conagra Brands is proud to be a founding member 
of the American Institute for Packaging and the 
Environment (AMERIPEN), a packaging trade 
organization created to advocate for environmentally and economically sound packaging policy improvements. AMERIPEN educates stakeholders 
about public policies that impact the packaging value 
chain. As an advocate for the packaging industry — which includes raw material producers and packaging manufacturers, users and fillers, as well as retailers 
and material recovery operations — AMERIPEN 
drives policy-related conversations about packaging and the environment. The organization has made 
considerable progress in advancing its objectives, 
completing and publishing primary research on packaging’s role in the value chain, collection and recycling infrastructure of the 100 largest U.S. cities 
and funding mechanisms for improved collection of 
used packaging. Conagra Brands continues to play a leadership role in these important conversations.Four years ago, Conagra Brands became a member of the How2Recycle label program — one we helped 
to develop with the Sustainable Packaging Coalition. 
This label addresses the need for more complete and accurate end-of-life instructions for packaging and drives clarity and consistency for recycling 
messaging on packaged goods. The How2Recycle 
label helps consumers understand how to dispose of each component within the package system, and whether it is widely collected or not. As part of our 
2020 sustainability goals, we aim to include the 
How2Recycle label on all Conagra products sold in the U.S. Visit www.how2recycle.info  for more details.As part of our commitment to packaging and the environment, Conagra Brands has been a member 
of the Association of Plastics Recyclers (APR) 
since 2010. APR is the national trade association representing companies who collect, reprocess, convert and use more than 90 percent of the recycled 
plastic in North America. They serve as an advocacy 
group for the recycling of post-consumer plastics of all kinds by developing standards and programs for design for recyclability, testing protocols, and 
providing factual communication on the benefits 
of recycling for consumers and municipalities. We embrace APR’s goals as a part of our mission 
to deliver quality products with the lowest overall 
environmental impact using lifecycle thinking.

important issue for our industry. When people 
are enjoying food — at home or away — they 
do not question whether it is safe to eat. Yet, every year, about 48 million Americans — 1 in 6 — get sick from eating contaminated food, 
according to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. Of that number, 130,000 are hospitalized with foodborne illnesses, and 3,000 die. A 2010 study sponsored by 
The Pew Charitable Trusts pegged the total 
annual cost of foodborne illness at $152 billion. Food safety and quality is an issue 
that must be addressed in every step of the 
value chain — from farm to fork — and is of utmost importance to all of our stakeholders.
Our management approach 
Conagra Brands has a number of rigorous food safety and quality policies and procedures that 
ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of our 
food preparation and delivery to customers. Our programs cover everything from how our employees inspect ingredients as they arrive at our facilities to what temperature our food should be stored 
at as it leaves our facilities for delivery to our 
customers. Food safety is part of our culture and extends through all levels of our company because 
we understand that it’s everyone’s responsibility. 
Our Food Safety & Quality teams manage the integrity of our food from farm to fork, beginning with sourcing ingredients, through preparation 
and delivery to our customers and consumers. 
These teams are comprised of experts who provide functional leadership in key areas such as:
In addition to employing subject-matter experts 
who can share their expertise on an ongoing basis, we assure our food safety programs are world-
class by engaging independent experts. We have 
periodic expert consultant reviews along with a Scientific Advisory Council to provide ongoing input and advice about the newest and emerging food safety practices. The Council includes independent 
experts recognized in the industry for their expertise 
in various food safety disciplines such as: food science, microbiology, toxicology, epidemiology, 
microbial physiology, public health and public policy.FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY

Ensuring safety & quality from farm to fork. As both a consumer foods company and commercial foodservice supplier, Conagra Brands is uniquely positioned within 
the food industry to affect food safety and quality. We are committed to ensuring the safety and quality of the food we make by implementing what we believe to be 
best-in-class processes in our facilities and by working with suppliers to ensure we have a trusted supply of ingredients. One reason for our success in working with 
and educating suppliers is that we, too, are a major supplier to the food industry. We supply numerous foodservice, retail and food processors with menu offerings and ingredients. Though our business models are different, our commitment to ensuring food safety and quality is consistent and unwavering.
Research, development  
& product innovation
Designing food safety and quality elements into new foods and 
packaging includes validating 
preparation and cooking instructions through a dedicated team of experts in microwave technology. Our 
packaging is designed, tested and 
continually re-evaluated to ensure that it is performing as intended to maintain the wholesomeness, 
quality and safety of the food.Procurement &

In addition to our internal supplier 
quality and auditing teams, we use 
registered certification bodies to 
audit our suppliers’ facilities on an annual basis against Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) standards. 
70% of our direct suppliers have 
completed GFSI certification which encompasses environmental risks. In addition, we measure and monitor 
our top 80% of direct materials

collaboration on food safety initiatives and increase visibility on emerging industry issues. 
These partnerships not only help take our own food safety programs to the next level, but also 
enhance food safety throughout our supply chain, while positively impacting the industry as a whole. 
Our comprehensive supplier quality program is an integral part of our procurement strategy. We only 
buy and use ingredients that comply with the appropriate regulatory requirements for food safety. 
In addition to our internal audit team, we use registered certification agencies to audit our suppliers’ 
facilities on an annual basis using Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) standards. For any issue 
identified during an audit, we follow up by approving and confirming implementation of corrective actions. Our internal audit team conducted 170 total facility audits in fiscal 2017, encompassing

FOOD SAFETY AUDIT AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS
At Conagra Brands, we strive to be the best, and doing so requires both internal and external 
validation of our work. Our robust internal 
food safety audit program is a reflection of our continuous improvement culture, driving us to always raise the bar. Responsible for being our 
toughest critic, our internal food safety and quality 
audit team proactively identifies food safety and quality enhancement opportunities at our facilities. Our internal food safety auditors help us continually 
improve by visiting our facilities, suppliers and 
co-manufacturers to observe employee behaviors and ask questions about their processes.
In addition, we have achieved certifications 
from independent and external food safety auditors according to globally recognized food safety and quality standards, as outlined by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). As one of 
the first U.S. companies to adopt the program, 
Conagra Brands has aggressively pursued GFSI certification, a program led by food retailers and manufacturers. Our food safety culture is 
embraced throughout the entire organization.
Several food safety standards have been 
developed and approved through the initiative, 
and Conagra Brands has achieved certification 
through two of those standards: SQF or BRC, depending on the business segment. When 
facilities earn SQF or BRC certification, it means 
they have enhanced their food safety and quality systems, driving better business results.

attributes of food, which in combination with 
other attributes — such as taste, convenience, 
ingredients and cost — ultimately defines the overall value to our consumers. Nutrition is intimately linked to health promotion and 
disease prevention, and is a critical issue for 
nearly all of our stakeholders, most notably our consumers, customers, public policy makers, industry associations, investors and 
non-governmental organizations (NGO).
Our management approach
 
Our Research and Development organization is 
responsible for product development, including 
delivering against portfolio-wide nutrition 
improvement objectives. Within this group, our director of nutrition leads the development and implementation of strategic nutrition planning. 
Progress and results are shared regularly with our 
senior leaders and periodically reviewed by members of the board of directors. We also share progress with an external Scientific Advisory Council, which 
was formed in 2006. Composed of leaders from 
research and academic institutions, these experts share their perspectives and knowledge to guide our strategy, actions and positions on nutrition-related 
issues. Our overall approach to health and nutrition 
is grounded in three focus areas — portion and calorie control, dietary diversity and heart health. Our 
internal nutrition education program creates a strong 
link to health and nutrition within our innovation process, enabling a more informed business. At the same time, we also invest in research to further 
our understanding of health and nutrition and share 
information externally. Health professionals have access to our educational materials and programs to support their continued development and ability 
to translate science-based information into practical 
guidelines and recommendations for consumers. 
We are committed to health and addressing evolving 
nutrition science along with changing consumer perceptions. In fiscal year 2017, when the FDA asked stakeholders for input to help rework the definition 
of “healthy,” Conagra Brands took a leadership role 
and provided our perspectives at an FDA public meeting. By partnering with the FDA and sharing our thoughts, we hope to continue advancing 
the what it means to be healthy and providing 
consumers with food that fits that definition.NUTRITION HEALTH & NUTRITION

Eating a little less really adds up
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ Evidence Analysis Library review of single serving portion 
sized meals showed that, for people who are 
overweight or obese, consuming one or more single serving meals per day as part of a weight management program for eight weeks 
to six months resulted in weight loss of 7 to 22 
pounds. And long-term studies showed weight loss of up to 22 pounds over 12-18 months.

Labeling our food is an important element 
of our brand-building and marketing efforts. 
Being compliant with all legal and regulatory 
requirements is our first priority, and all labels go through a rigorous review cycle prior to being printed. Packaging graphics are reviewed by 
multiple functions, including registered dietitians, 
food labelers, nutritionists, food scientists, our legal department and marketers. Conagra Brands believes in helping consumers to make educated food choices. In 2016, in 
response to the FDA issuance of Nutrition Label 
Reform, we began updating the nutritional panels on our packaging. The new consumer friendly format highlights calories and serving 
sizes as important elements in making food 
choices. We anticipate our entire portfolio to reflect the new Nutrition Facts Panel in 2019. *
Now more than ever, consumers want to know more about what is in the food they eat. And 
they aren’t just interested in a list of ingredients. 
They want to know why those ingredients are used, where they came from, and how they can impact overall health. And companies 
need to address these questions through 
more open and transparent communication.
Our management approach
In response to consumers’ expectations for 
more transparency, we’re doing more to ensure they can find the information they want quickly 
and easily. Whether glancing at a nutrition

We fully support consumers being as informed 
as possible about our food. In addition to direct
communications via our Consumer Affairs 
Center, the printed package, and our branded websites, we are also participating in the SmartLabel
TM program  developed by the 
Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA).
SmartLabel is a tool that provides consumers 
with detailed information such as nutrition facts, ingredient definitions, allergens, certifications like 
organic or Non-GMO verified and many other 
product attributes. With consumers wanting more  information about their food, Conagra voluntarily chose to use the SmartLabel tool to provide 
consumers with a way to easily access product 
information beyond what is on the product’s label. SmartLabel leverages readily available mobile 
technology to provide consumers with another 
way to easily access detailed product information; more than could ever fit on a package.
Consumers can find this detailed 
information in several ways: 
• Visiting our brand websites
• Scanning the QR code on the packaging
• Using the SmartLabel product search 
on www.smartlabel.org
• Searching the web In fiscal year 2017, we focused our efforts on the 
U.S. rollout of SmartLabel as that is where the majority of our products are made and sold. We 
currently have approximately 300 pages live on 
smartlabel.org and we look forward to adding more pages each day to provide our consumers with significantly more information. Even if some 
of our products don’t yet display the SmartLabel 
QR code on the packaging, consumers can still visit smartlabel.org or the product website for more information.

A key component of our food safety program 
is carefully managing major food allergens 
throughout our supply chain and in our own 
facilities. Our allergen program promotes best practices designed to prevent cross-contact and to ensure that the presence of food allergens in 
a food is communicated clearly to consumers. In 
fact, our allergen management program pre-dates the passage of the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) in 2004.
Our branded foods that contain allergens include a 
“Contains” statement located below the ingredient statement. This statement will use plain language 
to disclose any of the top eight food allergens 
contained in the food. We recommend consumers with food allergies always check the ingredient statement each time they purchase one of our 
foods because product formulations may change.Some of our food packages may feature a 
precautionary “May Contain” statement. We always 
use Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and 
thoroughly clean our equipment after using allergen-containing ingredients. In some cases, however, our efforts may not ensure the absence of a potential 
allergen simply due to the nature of the equipment 
or process. If one of our foods features a “May Contain” statement, we recommend that people allergic to the foods listed not consume the product.
On August 5, 2014, the FDA’s final rule for 
gluten-free foods took effect. All foods bearing a “Gluten Free” claim must assure they contain less 
than 20 ppm (parts per million) gluten. Conagra 
Brands has some foods that bear this claim. They only do so, however, after meeting the requirements of a comprehensive program that 
reviews the ingredients, verifies the suitability of 
the facility, and incorporates appropriate testing to assure that all of our foods bearing gluten-free claims are in full compliance with the rule.GENETIC MODIFICATION
Conagra Brands agrees with the FDA and numerous trusted scientific bodies and regulatory agencies 
(World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) that foods and beverages that contain ingredients 
derived from genetically modified organisms (GMO) 
are safe and nutritious to eat. Given the potential for GMO to improve the quality, sustainable availability and nutritional value of food, we support 
its responsible use when based on sound science 
and appropriate regulatory and safety reviews.
Conagra Brands welcomes a national, uniform 
approach to disclosure on the use of GMOs in food. In July 2016, a new GMO Labeling Law in the US was passed by Congress and signed into 
law by the President. Under this law, the USDA 
will create a national GMO labeling standard and will require all food packages to indicate whether they contain GMO ingredients, either through 
information provided on the label or via an on-
package link such as a QR code. The USDA has until 2018 to finalize regulations implementing the law and Conagra Brands intends to closely 
monitor the rulemaking process and comply fully 
with the final regulations while taking customer needs and consumer preferences into account.
We stand behind the health and safety of all 
our products, including those with genetically engineered ingredients. We understand that 
this is an area of evolving public perception and 
opinion and we offer a broad portfolio that appeals to a wide range of consumers, including many that have been non-GMO project verified.Our food safety program  
takes extra precaution  
when handling major

Our consumers and customers have come to know 
our brands through a variety of marketing channels, 
including advertisements. We understand the 
necessity of marketing to families with children in a responsible way. We participate in the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) of 
the Council of Better Business Bureaus, a voluntary 
industry self-regulation program supported by many of the nation’s largest food and beverage companies. The mission of the CFBAI is to shift advertising 
for foods that appeal to children to messaging that 
encourages healthier dietary choices and lifestyles. As a CFBAI participant since 2007, we have strengthened our commitment to responsible 
children’s marketing over the years. Under our 
CFBAI pledge today, Conagra Brands devotes 100 percent of its advertising directed to children under 12 years of age to products that meet 
CFBAI’s uniform nutritional criteria followed by all 
CFBAI participants. In addition, we restrict our use of licensed characters, celebrities, movie tie-ins and interactive gaming in such advertising to food 
meeting the uniform nutrition guidelines. We also no 
longer conduct advertising in elementary schools to children under the age of 12 or seek product 
placements in children’s programming, and we do not run advertising primarily directed to children 
under 6 years of age in TV, radio, print and Internet. 
On Dec. 31, 2013, CFBAI implemented new uniform 
nutrition criteria to be followed by all participants. We collaborated closely with CFBAI and other 
participants in developing these uniform nutrition 
criteria to help improve the nutritional composition of foods currently marketed to children under 12 years of age. The uniform nutrition criteria have raised the 
bar for nutritional standards of foods that can be 
marketed to children under 12 by CFBAI participants and comprise a realistic set of standards designed to 
motivate participants to make better-for-you foods.
Conagra Brands devotes

advertising to foods that  
meet the CFBAI’s Uniform 
Nutrition Criteria.

and materials than the traditional measures 
of cost and quality. Responsible sourcing 
means being accountable for not just what is purchased, but how it was sourced. This starts at the farms where ingredients are 
grown and extends through the supply 
chain, with care and consideration for the people, animals, and environment along the way. Responsible sourcing is an extension 
of conventional supply chain management, 
focused on mitigating risks and enhancing value, critical to the success of business. 
Our management approach
 
At the highest level, governance for responsible 
sourcing is managed through our Supplier Code 
of Conduct, outlining the basic expectations for 
doing business with Conagra Brands. We include consideration for labor practices and human rights, animal welfare and environmental performance. 
When taking action on ingredient or packaging 
material specific issues, we take a collaborative approach, with our technical experts working hand-in-hand with category managers in Enterprise Procurement. We tailor our management approach 
to compliment the influence and relationships we 
have in our supply chain. For example, where  we have direct relationships with suppliers,  
we work with each individually to enact change. 
In instances where we’re managing responsible sourcing issues embedded further in our supply chain, we often leverage the expertise and 
influence of NGO or industry associations to drive 
change in the marketplace. Regardless of our approach, we are committed to communicating progress with interested stakeholders. This year, 
Conagra Brands participated in the CDP Forests 
disclosure  for the first time. We recognize that 
our supply chain sourcing decisions around palm 
oil, beef, timber and soy carry important social 
and environmental considerations, and we are committed to supply chain transparency. This disclosure is a key step in our ongoing planning 
efforts around sustainable commodity management.RESPONSIBLE SOURCING

The only way to deliver quality products is to follow 
quality procedures, which includes how farm 
animals are raised, handled, and processed. We 
believe in the humane treatment of animals. It’s the right thing to do, and is an important consideration in sourcing our dairy and protein ingredients. 
We also support such programs as Beef Quality 
Assurance (BQA) and Pork Quality Assurance Plus (PQA Plus). These programs can be verified with third party audits and encompass how farm 
animals are raised, herd health, animal handling, 
and processing. Our Supplier Quality Program outlines specific expectations for appropriate 
animal care, and we encourage all of our suppliers 
to purchase only from farms that comply with industry guidelines, including those established by the USDA and the Food Marketing Institute. 1 million cage-free eggs
We are working toward a supply of 100 percent cage-free eggs throughout our U.S. and Canada 
operations by 2025. Since 2011, Conagra Brands 
has incorporated one million cage-free eggs into our products annually. This decision reflects Conagra Brands’ ongoing effort to explore cage-free as a 
viable alternative to traditional egg supplies.
Elimination of gestation stall housing  
for sows
As part of Conagra Brands’ long-standing 
commitment to the humane treatment and 
handling of animals, we have asked our pork 
suppliers to present actionable plans in 2017 that address movement towards both the elimination of gestation stalls and creation of traceability systems within the pork supply chain. Our decision came following many months of 
research, evaluating animal welfare, business 
and supply implications, customer requirements, discussions with the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) and other special interest groups, 
challenges involved in making changes within 
the supply chain and other considerations. We believe this is the right thing to do, and we are committed to continue working with pork suppliers 
who share our commitment to the best animal 
welfare and handling practices. During 2017, we continued to meet individually with each producer 
to understand their plans to meet this commitment, 
progress to-date and challenges that lie ahead.

As a global food company, we source ingredients  
from around the world to deliver high-quality, 
flavorful and nutritious products. Though our 
supply chain is composed of business partners with locations throughout the U.S. and the world, local sourcing is a consideration in our 
purchasing strategy. Local sourcing can help 
reduce the food-miles in our transportation and logistics network, while providing convenient access to our raw ingredients and packaging. The 
following highlights a few examples where primary 
ingredients are sourced close to our facilities.
PeanutsSituated in prime peanut-growing country, nearly all of the peanuts used in our Peter Pan peanut butter 
are grown within 250 miles of our facility in  
Sylvester, Ga.Dairy
 
Located in the heart of Wisconsin dairy country, our Swiss Miss facility in Menomonie, Wis., 
buys about 25 million gallons of milk annually 
from a local network of dairy farms located less than 100 miles from our facility. 
Popcorn
 
About 200 farmers in Nebraska, Indiana, Ohio, 
Iowa, Missouri and South Dakota raise more than 300 million pounds of popcorn for Conagra Brands 
each year. More than 90 percent of these farmers 
have grown with us for at least 10 years, with many being second- and third-generation farmers whose 
families have been our partners for decades.
Fruits  
Ingredients for our Marie Callender’s pies are 
thoughtfully sourced, grown in regions famous 
for their fresh fruits. Apple desserts are made 
with fresh Fuji apples grown in central California and eastern Washington, while cherry varieties feature Montgomery Cherries from Michigan 
and Wisconsin. Marie Callender’s famous 
pumpkin pie is made with Dickinson pumpkins, grown in Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri.
Tomatoes  
Grown within a 250-mile radius of our tomato fresh-pack facilities in Oakdale, Calif., our tomatoes are typically prepared less than 
eight hours after being harvested.

Over the past decade, our growers have installed drip irrigation systems on 19,265 of the 21,150 contracted acres, or 91 percent of contracted acres, 
improving sustainable farming practices by:
• Enabling growers to install permanent beds  
and apply conservation tillage practices,  
reducing farm equipment fuel use. 
• Reducing water use by nearly 15 percent 
compared to traditional furrow irrigation systems. 
• Reducing nutrient and crop management chemical application rates due to precise 
application.  
•  Enabling our growers to plant fewer acres while 
yielding the same amount of tomatoes. The installation of drip irrigation systems increases 
the tons per acre by about 30 percent, meaning 
that without drip irrigation, our growers would have needed to farm an additional 7,000 acres.YIELDING THE

Conagra Brands uses palm oil as a functional 
ingredient in several of our branded and food 
service products due to its unique properties. 
We purchase palm oil from U.S.-based suppliers — some run integrated operations that cultivate, harvest and process the oil, and others act 
as commodities traders who purchase and 
distribute palm oil that has been cultivated by other parties. Over the past several years, we’ve become increasingly aware of the potential 
environmental and social risks associated with 
the cultivation, harvesting and processing of palm oil, and we have taken steps to improve 
the sustainability of our palm oil supply chain.
Conagra Brands is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) , an organization 
dedicated to promoting the growth and use of 
sustainable palm oil products through credible global 
standards and the engagement of stakeholders. We support the principles of the RSPO and RSPO efforts to encourage and certify sustainable palm oil 
production practices. To help ensure our purchases 
do not contribute to the deforestation of the world’s rainforests or negatively impact the communities that depend on them, we have purchased GreenPalm 
certificates for all of our purchased palm oil and 
have begun to move to the Mass Balance system. We are also working with our suppliers to support 
the development of a sustainable, cost-effective 
market for palm oil to prevent the deforestation of lands for the purpose of developing new palm plantations. We will purchase palm oil only 
from RSPO members — with preference for 
purchasing RSPO certified sustainable palm oil. We are dedicated to sourcing palm oil only from suppliers whose landholdings and 
operations meet the following principles:
•  Only legal sources that adhere to all relevant 
international, national and local legislation  
and regulation.
• No development on high conservation value 
landscapes or high carbon stock (HCS) forests. 
While the HCS methodology is being refined by 
field testing and science review, new plantings should only be established in low carbon  
stock areas.
• No development on peat lands regardless of depth and use of best management practices  
for existing plantations on peat.
• No burning in the preparation of new plantings, 
re-plantings or other developments and the 
progressive reduction of GHG emissions.
•  Compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct 
which describes our expectations in matters 
including food safety and quality, forced labor, 
child labor, freedom of association and collective bargaining, discrimination and harassment,  wages and benefits, work hours and overtime, 
health and safety, environment and  
anti-corruption.
• Respect Land Tenure Rights, including the rights of indigenous and local communities 
to give or withhold their Free, Prior and 
Informed Consent to all new development or operations on lands to which they hold legal, communal or customary rights. 
 •  Prevention and resolution of social and/or  
land conflicts through an open, transparent  
and consultative process. 
•  Traceability to the extraction mill and validation 
of fresh fruit bunches to the plantation estate.
By end of calendar year 2016, we secured supply chain certification for 98 percent of our production facilities that use palm oil. Certification of these 
facilities enable use of Mass Balance certified  
oil for about 93 percent of our consumption.  
We will continue to engage with both external and 
internal stakeholders to promote and encourage 
the use of RSPO Certified Sustainable Palm Oil.

At Conagra Brands, we believe that adhering to the 
highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior 
is the only way to succeed, so we have set high 
standards for the way we conduct business, in areas from corporate and social responsibility to sound business ethics. Because the conduct of our 
suppliers can be attributed to Conagra Brands and 
its reputation, our expectation is that our suppliers will lawfully conduct their business with the same standards of integrity and ethical behavior. Every 
supplier must abide by our Code of Conduct for 
Suppliers , and agree to the expectations within as 
a condition of doing business with Conagra Brands. 
Furthermore, suppliers must take 
reasonable measures to ensure that their suppliers and sub-contractors also act in 
accordance with these expectations. 
Our Code of Conduct for Suppliers provides 
minimum expectations related to: 
• Compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
• Workplace and human rights 
• Animal welfare 
• Health, safety and the environment 
• Ethical dealings 
• Monitoring and record keepingSupplier Excellence Program
In fiscal year 2017 Conagra Brands launched a 
new Supplier Excellence Program which includes 
our top direct material suppliers, which represent 
80% of Conagra’s overall direct materials spend. Through the program we build strong connections with our top suppliers, drive clarity 
through standardized scorecard metrics, foster 
deep collaboration through ongoing business reviews and cross-functional business teams and create mutual value for all involved. Suppliers 
are evaluated against four key metrics: 
• Supplier advantaged growth
• Operating a lean supply chain
• Sustaining competitive margins
• Enabling the Conagra way 
Top performing suppliers are recognized at our 
annual Supplier Excellence Summit. The program has been integral to providing our suppliers with deeper transparency into our needs and key 
challenge areas by focusing on our vision and 
mission to align our organizations for mutual success and unlock joint value creation.Supplier Advisory Board 
This year Conagra Brands instituted a Supplier Advisory Board to engage key suppliers in a 
more holistic manner across the entire value 
chain. Comprised of 12 suppliers from Conagra’s Supplier Excellence program and other high impact suppliers along with cross-functional 
representation from Conagra’s Procurement, 
R&D and Operations businesses, the Advisory Board builds stronger supplier relationships while supporting the Conagra values of External 
Focus, Broad Mindedness and Agility. 
New suppliers
Conagra has a rigorous process in place to ensure 
we have the appropriate documentation from our suppliers. This includes but is not limited to spec sheets, allergen information, conflicts of interest, 
third-party audits and country of manufacture 
statements. Our Supplier Quality team reviews all materials to be purchased, where those materials come from, the potential supplier’s third party 
audit, proposed final use of the material and 
other information about the material or supplier.

less likely to experience significant instances of business misconduct, and show higher productivity levels – as much as 12 percent

1 Conversely, business 
misconduct can result in direct costs such as fines, legal fees, and remediation costs. Other 
indirect costs may include decreased employee engagement, greater employee turnover and negative impacts on business reputation. 
Our management approach 
Ethics and integrity are essential to the way we conduct business at Conagra Brands. Integrity is 
the first of our Timeless Values, and provides the 
foundation for our commitment to doing the right things and doing things right. Our Timeless Values 
are intended to make sure everyone knows and 
understands what is required of them – things like ensuring the safety of our people, our foods and our brands, integrity-based decision making, 
appropriate workplace conduct, responsible 
management of corporate resources, and protecting intellectual property, privacy, and confidentiality.  To maintain a high integrity culture, Conagra 
has invested in a network of compliance 
subject matter experts who support, manage and enforce our policies, like our Code of Conduct. Our cross-functional team brings an 
enterprise-wide view to our compliance activities 
throughout the organization. Additionally, we have a Compliance Committee made up of senior business and legal leaders from across the 
enterprise who provide cross-functional guidance 
and support for our compliance program.
Day-to-day, every employee is expected to 
lead with integrity. Our people managers are responsible for creating and fostering a culture of integrity within their teams by demonstrating our 
Timeless Values both in actions and words. This 
means ensuring an understanding of the policy requirements in Conagra’s Code of Conduct, as well as any compliance policies specific to 
individual day-to-day activities. Additionally, all 
employees are responsible for holding others accountable for their behavior and immediately 
addressing actions that do not comply with our 
Code of Conduct or other corporate requirements. Finally, our employees are encouraged and empowered to bring their questions or concerns 
to their managers, our Legal and Government 
Affairs department, and/or the Audit/Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Employees are also encouraged to raise concerns through our

Conagra’s Code of Conduct  provides guideposts 
for how each of our employees and directors are 
expected to conduct themselves when representing 
Conagra both inside and outside the workplace. It is each employee’s responsibility to uphold the Code of Conduct, and as a company, we hold 
ourselves accountable for our successes and our 
shortcomings. Our Code of Conduct highlights the legal and ethical standards for conducting business, managing our employees, and for 
interacting with consumers, suppliers, customers, 
communities, and government officials. It also guides our environmental practices and reminds 
us of our duty and obligation to abide by all laws 
and regulations to protect our shared natural resources and to minimize any negative impact. 
The Audit/Finance Committee of our Board of 
Directors oversees the Code of Conduct and designates appropriate personnel to determine remedial actions in the event of a violation. In 
support of our culture of compliance, all new 
employees are required to take a Code of Conduct course as part of their onboarding process. Additionally, we conduct regular training to ensure 
that our employees are aware of our expectations 
and their obligations under the Code of Conduct. WORKING WITH INTEGRITY
Conagra prohibits the use of forced labor in our operations, including human trafficking and 
slavery. Accordingly, any work performed by 
an employee or an associate that is involuntary and/or performed under the threat of physical harm or other penalty is strictly prohibited.
To the extent any employee objects to his or her 
terms and/or conditions of employment, he or she may raise a complaint to his or her manager, 
a member of the Legal and Government Affairs 
department, and/or through Conagra’s third-party ethics hotline 866.567.CODE (2633), or 
the employee may leave the company at any 
time. Conagra takes seriously all reports made through our ethics hotline and ensures that all are investigated properly. Further, Conagra has 
a strict non-retaliation policy for all good faith 
reports made through all reporting channels, including our ethics hotline. Conagra complies with state and federal child labor laws through our 
hiring policies and human resources practices. 
Conagra’s standard entry-level wage is equal to—and often exceeds – the local minimum wage in locales in which we operate.
What does acting with integrity 
mean in our organization? 
Compliance with a defined set 
of standards and requirements, plus a voluntary commitment to 
ethical behavior.

Providing a safe work environment for our 
employees is a top priority at Conagra Brands. Our 
health and safety management process is driven 
by engaged employees who have established a foundation of safe practices. As we strive to achieve an injury-free workplace, it becomes 
increasingly important to maintain a strong culture 
of safety, in which all employees are committed to protecting themselves and their colleagues.
To support this culture, we have several initiatives 
that provide employees with opportunities to actively participate in developing our safety 
processes. These include conducting safety audits, 
inspections and behavioral observations, as well as leading safety training and safety reminder discussions during pre-shift huddle meetings. In 
addition, every facility develops an annual Safety 
and Health Accident Reduction Plan (SHARP) to define site-specific health and safety priorities.Our health and safety team audits each of our facilities to ensure compliance with safety 
regulations and corporate policies. The team 
documents results and tracks corrective actions to ensure we hold ourselves accountable for providing a safe work environment. We require all accidents, 
near-miss incidents and injuries to be thoroughly 
investigated to help ensure that appropriate actions are taken and lessons are identified to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
More than just numbers
As a company, we take to heart exactly what our 
safety metrics represent — the health, well-being 
and lives of our employees. We are fully committed to maintaining a safe work environment because we recognize that our employees are our greatest 
asset. During fiscal year 2017, our Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Incident 
Rate (OIR) stayed flat compared to the previous 
year at 1.79 incidents per 100 full-time workers.
When accidents do happen, it’s important to 
provide the best possible medical care to injured 
employees, while addressing the root causes of 
the accident to minimize the possibility that it will happen again. In fiscal year 2017, eleven Conagra Brands facilities were inspected by OSHA, with 
each inspection resulting in only minor citations.
We are tirelessly working to build a strong 
foundation of safety in all of our facilities through 
leadership, accountability and teamwork instilled through our proven Key Concepts of Safety program. We are optimistic that we’ll see 
continued improvement during fiscal year 2018.

The Council Bluffs frozen foods facility made a 
significant turnaround in its safety performance in 
fiscal year 2017, reducing work related injuries by 36 percent and lowering the OSHA Incident Rate (OIR) from 2.0 to 0.68 while working 1.7 million 
hours. This achievement was largely due to the 
site Safety Team finding a variety of activities to increase employee involvement in the overall safety effort. These activities included daily safety 
walks throughout the plant, employee-based safety 
behavior audits with semi-weekly reporting and feedback, revitalized safety team organization 
and site leadership conducting 1:1 employee 
safety surveys developed by the SWAG Team. The information gathered from these activities is summarized and communicated to each functional 
area during daily and weekly Conagra Performance

Conagra’s largest frozen food facility in Russellville, 
Ark., reduced its OSHA Incident Rate (OIR) in 
a “BIG WAY” during fiscal year 2017, finishing the year at 0.89 OIR, while working a total of 2.4 million hours. By focusing on proactive indicators 
such as behavior-based audits, Key Concepts 
of Safety, safety training and overall employee engagement, the site used a team approach to find workable solutions reducing their overall first 
aid incidents by 22 percent year-over-year. This 
holistic approach from hourly to salaried individuals helped increase site efficiency, boost employee morale and improve the overall site safety culture.  RENSSELAER, IND.Conagra Brands in Rensselaer, Indiana finished 
fiscal year 2017 with a zero OIR. This was 
accomplished with 486,121 employee hours worked. The facility also continued their record no Lost-
Time Accidents (LTAs) since its opening in 1994. 
Zero OIR is a big improvement from the fiscal year 2016 OIR score of 1.18 (3 recordable incidents).
The success of fiscal year 2017 lies in applying 
Conagra Performance System (CPS) principles and increasing the engagement of our employees. An example of this is the Job Safety Analysis 
(JSA) review. In the past, the safety team would 
put together a group of seven or eight employees to review all the plant’s JSAs annually. In some instances, employees were reviewing JSAs for 
equipment they seldom operated and had to seek 
advice from the full-time operator. This use of second-hand information resulted in procedures that were not as precise as they could have been. This year, several employees suggested a 
change. The operators of the equipment should 
be directly responsible for the creation, revision and review of their equipment’s JSAs. Using 
their suggestions, JSAs created in fiscal year 
2017 were reviewed by each of the operators. This allowed them, the subject matter experts, to have an immediate impact on safety procedures 
and improvements for the equipment they used. 
It also created more employee engagement.
By updating our process for JSAs we: 
•  Enhanced safety performance 
and employee morale
•  Better defined job descriptions 
and required physical tasks
•  Improved new hire orientation, job 
performance and safety training priorities

communities so we actively pursue business relationships with innovative, diverse companies. During fiscal year 2017, we spent more than 
$348 million with more than 500 minority,

Conagra Brands strives to have the most energized, 
highest-impact culture in the food industry.  
The Enterprise Learning team believes that to 
do this, we must support great development experiences. This year, we refocused our 
development efforts, implemented a learning 
platform that is better integrated with our HR systems, and began implementing a new talent development strategy and philosophy. 
This allows us to provide employees with 
the right tools and experiences, at the right place and time in their career journey.
Transitions
 Employees need the most support during transitions. Beginning with onboarding, these transitions take the form of promotions, job 
changes, or moving into leadership roles. We 
create development experiences around these transitions, with a special focus towards onboarding, 
management transitions and frontline managers. Onboarding
 New employee onboarding begins prior to the 
employee’s first day and continues throughout their first few months. This includes guidance from their manager, and a new extensive online self-guided 
learning program. This curriculum is assigned to 
each new employee, and provides benefits, business practices and processes, functional development, and enculturation opportunities that support the 
onboarding transition. Each new employee also 
registers for a redesigned, six-hour, instructor-led orientation where they network with other new 
employees and learn about our values and strategic 
capabilities from leaders within the organization.
Customization
 Our current employee wants a personalized experience. We focus on creating libraries featuring relevant, curated and contextualized 
content from internal and external resources. 
Supporting this strategy, we completed a cross-functional pilot with two learning content partners, 
providing access to more than 10,000 curated 
development assets. We expect to roll out curated content aligned to user needs; specifically, our values, development philosophy, and function 
learning to salaried employees in 2017.Leadership and management
 Managers play a crucial role in employee 
development. To this end, we provide leaders and managers with relevant development content each month. These include short, specific 
eLearning modules designed for quick digestion, 
application and later reference for performance support. New modules are added periodically as business needs change. Also, we produce the 
Manager Minute; a monthly release that includes 
a video and application resources featuring a new manager each month. All leadership development, 
self-guided experiences are available to all 
employees with access to network resources. 
Looking forward
 In fiscal year 2018 we expect to pilot user-generated content integration. This allows employees to immediately create and curate learning resources 
on their own with the help and moderation of the 
Enterprise Learning function. We continue to build capacity and capability in Learning & Development. 
We drive innovation through our learning platforms, 
technology, and instructional design methodology to meet business needs in an agile and flexible manner.

Our management approach 
Conagra Brands takes a holistic approach to 
community investment that combines resources including product donations, employee volunteerism 
and cash contributions to directly impact the 
communities where our employees live and work.
Partnership and collaboration is essential, 
especially when working to impact large social 
issues. Therefore, we seek partnerships with highly respected nonprofit organizations with leadership teams that challenge the current status quo with 
innovative approaches that result in viable solutions.Through the Conagra Brands Foundation, we 
provide philanthropic support to select nonprofit 
organizations that align with our core focus areas. 
This includes a broad array of initiatives that address food insecurity, such as food access, nutrition education, cooking skills, healthy and 
active lifestyles and select urban agricultural 
programs that have a clear community focus and provide entrepreneurial skills to help individuals participate in the farm to fork economy.

Since 1923, United Way has supported programs 
that help the most vulnerable members of our 
community who struggle to secure basic services, 
such as obtaining food, finding housing, obtaining healthcare and living in a safe environment. During this year’s United Way campaign we encouraged 
our employees across the nation to make a 
United Way gift that was meaningful to them. With participation from employees at 23 facilities and office locations, we successfully raised more than 
$564,263. This included an additional contribution 
made by Conagra Brands Foundation to 10 United Way locations corresponding to where our 
employees ran exceptionally generous campaigns.SHINE THE LIGHT  
ON HUNGER
This year, we celebrated 
the 10th anniversary of 
our annual Shine the Light 
on Hunger campaign. This family friendly, community-wide call to 
action, advocacy and education campaign raises awareness and funds to support food access programs throughout Omaha, Neb. with the goal of raising the equivalent of 1.4 million meals.
To achieve a goal of this magnitude requires 
the involvement of the entire community, 
which has grown in support and participation 
year to year. The community was able to achieve the goal through participation in the Conagra Brands Ice Rink, as well as by making 
donations of non-perishable food items or direct 
contributions to Food Bank for the Heartland. The Conagra Brands Foundation matched these donations dollar-for-dollar up to $100,000.
Conagra Brands employees also stepped up to rally 
around this campaign. On Dec. 6, our very own culinary team along with more than 40 employees 
personally planned, shopped, prepared, cooked 
and served more than 850 hearty dinners for four local shelters. It was personally rewarding 
for all involved and provided an opportunity for 
our employees to step out of the office, come together, give back to the local community and fully participate in the spirit of giving.

From 2014 through 2016, Conagra Brands Foundation 
invested $4 million in an initiative to reduce hunger in 
Omaha - The Omaha Plan. Conagra partnered with 
five community organizations and the project focused on five target areas: food banks, food prices, financial management skills, school meals and the Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (fka food stamps). 
This highly targeted and collaborative approach yielded significant results as measured and reported by the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition. Over the 3 
year period, the percentage of households with very 
low food security has decreased and the percentage of households with high food security has increased.
Key programs results:
OMAHA PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The Grab & Go program gives students who come late to school a breakfast to eat in their first 
class. In 2014, the program was being piloted in 
a small sample of schools. Today, 49 elementary schools are signed on to the program. 
HUNGER COLLABORATIVE
Referrals for the Hunger Collaborative significantly increased from 21 in 2015 to 106 in 2016.
Through the Shared Driver System, more  
than 550,000 lbs. of food was delivered,  80 percent of which was meat, dairy or 
vegetables in fresh, cupboard or frozen form.
FOOD BANK FOR THE HEARTLAND
The SNAP approval rating increased almost  
6 percent (was at 69 percent, now around  
75 percent and growing).DOUGLAS COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT
Nebraska-Extension provided nutrition 
education to more than 2,500 participants.
Fresh Food Bonus Bucks (FFBB) increased sales 
of fresh fruits and vegetables by 65 percent and maintained this increase throughout second phase. 
CREIGHTON FINANCIAL HOPE

April is Conagra’s annual Month of Service, 
providing the opportunity for colleagues across 
the nation to give back and make a difference 
in our local communities. Conagra teams have the opportunity to work on causes close to Conagra – hunger, nutrition, food insecurity and 
access to healthy food – while connecting with 
each other and reinforcing our core values of integrity, external focus and leadership. This year, 2,397 employees were engaged in 89 
projects throughout 14 states and 3 countries and 
provided 6,881 volunteer hours. Our activities generated the equivalent of 430,851 meals for 
people facing food insecurities across the country.

Child Hunger Ends Here conclusion
This year, we wrapped up a five-year “Child 
Hunger Ends Here” campaign with the goal of 
raising awareness of child hunger in the United States. Through the campaign, more than ten million meals were donated with the help of 
Conagra Brands employees, the Feeding America 
Foodbank network and consumers looking to make a difference in the world around them.Disaster relief & support
AUGUST 2016:  Southern Louisiana experienced 
heavy flooding, the largest natural disaster to 
strike the U.S. since 2012. The Conagra Brands Foundation provided a grant to the American Red 
Cross to assist with its aid and recovery efforts. 
Conagra Brands has also donated five truckloads of Banquet chicken that were distributed via 
the Feeding America 
food banks in the affected areas.
NOVEMBER 2016: An outbreak of wildfires impacted 
the area of Gatlinburg, Tenn. and 14,000 residents 
evacuated their homes. Conagra Brands Foundation 
donated directly to the Second Harvest Food Bank 
of East Tennessee, a Feeding America network food bank, to support the food relief efforts.
JANUARY 2017: A series of strong storms and 
tornadoes hit Sylvester, Georgia, severely impacting 
the close-knit community where many Conagra Brands employees live and work. Conagra Brands 
Foundation provided support through donations to 
Second Harvest of South Georgia and American Red Cross. Additionally, Conagra Brands donated 
37,192 lbs. of Peter Pan Peanut Butter.
MARCH 2017: Conagra Brands Foundation 
provided a donation to the American Red Cross 
to support the relief and recovery response to 
the devastating storms which tore through parts of northern Illinois, damaging an estimated 500 homes and impacting hundreds of individuals.

Cubs food drive
Conagra Brands 
kicked off its Holiday 
Food Drive with the help of Chicago Cubs World Series Champs 
Kyle Schwarber, Dexter 
Fowler and Kyle Hendricks. The generosity of our employees resulted in 1,000 lbs. of food to benefit the Greater Chicago Food Depository. 
There was also high demand for the auction 
of autographed memorabilia that benefited the United Way. And of course there were smiles all 
around as the champs posed for pictures with 
employees, resulting in a true home run day.Conagra Womens NetworkThroughout fiscal year 2017, the Conagra 
Womens Network (CWN) played a large role 
in the community through several volunteerism initiatives including food, book and clothing drives. The CWN was a sponsor of the Dress for 
Success Clothing Drive, where they collected 
bags of used women’s professional wear to help women seeking employment. Members of the CWN hosted a book drive for Turning the Page, 
an organization that works to engage parents of 
public school students. And they partnered with schools including, the Young Women’s Leadership 
Charter School of Chicago by collecting school 
supplies for their students. Additionally, CWN members dedicated a day of their time to volunteer at the Greater Chicago Food Depository in efforts 
to help end hunger in the Chicagoland area. Habitat for Humanity  
Since 2014, Marie Callender’s Comfort for Home project has had a dedication to bringing 
heartwarming feelings, flavors and favorites of homes to people that need it most, including deserving groups of service men and women 
stationed overseas. In 2017, Marie Callender’s 
partnered with Habitat for Humanity to fulfill its mission of making sure that everyone has a decent place to call home. With the efforts 
of the Marie Callender’s team, they collected 
$310,000 to provide grants to Habitat for Humanity organizations across the country. The Comforts 
for Home project was fully supported with a 
robust media campaign to drive awareness of the USO and Habitat for Humanity missions.  While working on the campaign, the Conagra 
Brands marketing team spent a day volunteering 
by building a home for Habitat for Humanity.

Conagra Brands is in the final year of a $10 million 
three-year investment with Feeding America. We 
know reducing food insecurity is a complex issue 
and has many barriers. Through this partnership, Conagra Brands funded programs within food access, research, nutrition education and capacity 
building. Additionally, in fiscal year 2017 Conagra 
Brands donated 20.4 million lbs. of product, which is the equivalent 
of 17 million meals.
Food access
HUNGER-FREE SUMMER HUBS
Operating successful summer feeding programs can be challenging. The most effective programs involve stable, multifaceted partnerships that 
engage social service agencies, schools, 
churches, community organizations and/or other local leaders that are committed to improving the well-being of their young citizens. 
Conagra Brands funded Hunger-Free Summer  
Hubs grants to three food banks for three years (2015-2017) to evaluate the grantees’ current summer feeding landscape in their service area 
through a needs assessment, and, based on 
those findings, leverage local partnerships to implement holistic programs and services that increase access to summer meals for children 
and their families. It is a multi-service area, multi-
stakeholder, bi-level program evaluation and capacity-building project. These longer-term grants 
provide the opportunity to dig deeper into local 
needs and drive collaboration to make a larger collective impact. The three food banks include: Freestore Food Bank (City of Cincinnati), St. Mary’s 
Food Bank Alliance (Northern Arizona counties), 
and Lowcountry Food Bank (South Carolina).The purpose of Hunger-Free Summer funding is 
to support food banks across the Nation in alleviating hunger for children in the summer months, when school is not in session, especially through piloting sustainable program models that can potentially be 
replicated across the Feeding America network.
GRANT AWARDS 
The 2016 Conagra Brands Foundation Hunger-
Free Summer Grant funded cutting-edge summer 
programming for kids through 27 food banks across 21 states. Each of the participating food 
banks made large strides in our collective effort to 
close the summer meal gap for children in need.
AWARENESS BUILDING 
The summer hunger PSA campaign to raise 
programing awareness among families in need ran in 127 markets across the U.S., up from 122 in 2015, to support 93 food banks. The PSA included 
digital assets, radio spots and outdoor billboards. 
FUNDING IMPACT 
Outcomes at grant-funded sites include 421 sites 
operated, 17,725 children served (conservative 
count), and more than one million meals served. Grant-recipient food banks achieved six percent 
year-over-year summer meal growth in their  
service areas.
This represents 193 percent more overall summer 
program meals provided through HFS food banks 
compared to last summer’s HFS food banks—and highlights how Conagra Brands Foundation directly funded the distribution of more than 1 million meals!

MAP THE MEAL GAP
Map the Meal Gap is the annual 
study on the cost of food and food insecurity at both the county and congressional 
district level in the United States. The study 
finds that food-insecure individuals now face, on average, a food budget shortfall of $527.19 per person per year. Even accounting for inflation, this 
is an increase of 13 percent since 2008, the first 
full year of a major recession. This rising measure of need suggests that people facing hunger are 
likely falling further behind as they continue to 
struggle to buy enough food to meet their needs.
Food insecurity rates*TEENS AND FOOD INSECURITY IN AMERICA
Teen food insecurity is threatening American youth 
and their well-being, according to two new reports by the Urban Institute and Feeding America. While there is significant literature on food insecurity 
and children, most of this research has focused 
on the risks to and impact on children under age 6. This new research examines several topics related to the impact of food insecurity in teens’ 
lives. The reports reveal that low-income teens are 
aware of their parents’ struggles and often share in their worries and efforts to protect the youngest 
and most vulnerable members of the household 
by shielding younger siblings from hunger.
Nutrition education
Another component of our partnership focuses on 
nutrition education. Conagra Brands’ partnership included work in the Hungry to Help program, which is an integrated campaign that educates 
the public about the increased risk of child 
hunger during the summer and fuels a national conversation from the headlines to the dinner table. The centerpiece of the campaign is a “Family 
Action Plan to Fight Hunger in America”. Feeding 
America and Scholastic developed a hunger-based curriculum to teach K-2 students about empathy.Capacity buildingCHILD HUNGER CORPS
The Child Hunger Corps program began in 
2010 as a response to the lack of adequate staff capacity to expand programs. It is a national service program that deploys college graduates 
to food banks for two years to implement new, or 
expand existing, child programming. The goal of the program is to increase meals served to children in need, specifically by following a three-phase 
program design: Community Needs Assessment; 
Program Implementation and Sustainability; and Evaluation and Process Documentation.
Corps member placed at 
food banks on average grew their meals to children by 
24% 
 * Based on 2015 Data
 **   Corps member placed at food banks on average grew their meals to children by 
24 percent the year following the program, as compared to the 8 percent growth seen during that time period in food banks that did not host a Corps member. **

KEY IMPACTS RISKS OPPORTUNITIES
BETTER PLANET
Climate Change The physical, regulatory and reputational risks associated 
with climate change present risks to our operations, 
such as changing weather patterns affecting crop yields 
and regulatory costs related to carbon emissions. Improving energy and transportation efficiency and encouraging sustainable product and process innovation 
can reduce operating costs, improve our climate resiliency 
and limit the potential impact of greenhouse regulations. 
Food Waste Approximately 40 percent of all food is wasted, and if disposed of in a landfill, creates methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Food waste also represents a critical loss of our ingredients. Finding every opportunity to reduce food waste is the key. We can do that in our systems through better practices and yield improvements, and for our consumers with better packaging and product innovation. We follow the Environmental 
Protection Agency’s (EPA) Food Waste Hierarchy to direct 
those materials to a better destination than a landfill: to feed people, feed animals, recover energy or make compost.
Product Packaging Potential extended product responsibility (EPR) programs in the U.S. may change the business model around funding for the packaging recycling infrastructure and systems.While we continue to work to optimize our packaging through source reductions, use of renewable materials and increasing recycled content, we also recognize that packaging has a critical role to play in 
how we affect the issues of food waste and losses. Better packaging 
can reduce damage in transport and in stores and can also help food store longer, giving people more time to eat our food. Our opportunity 
is to make packaging work better to support the big picture. 
Water Risk We rely on the availability of quality water resources to grow raw ingredients and process finished goods. 
Concern over water scarcity and increasingly stringent water quality regulations can affect operations.Progress toward our water use reduction goal will improve  
our operating efficiency and reduce company exposure to  
water-related risks. 
GOOD FOOD
Health and Nutrition Health care issues facing the population have increased the need to help consumers balance their desire to maintain or improve 
the nutrition profile of their overall diet with their food and taste 
preferences, busy lifestyles and household budgets. If the food we make fails to keep pace with the interplay of these priorities, our business performance may be negatively impacted.To establish a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we integrate knowledge of consumer insights with nutrition 
science to make informed decisions about how to diversify 
our portfolio of foods to address the changing dynamics among nutrition, taste, cost and convenience.

CONTENTS        OVERVIEW        BETTER PLANET        GOOD FOOD        RESPONSIBLE SOURCING        STRONGER COMMUNITIES        ABOUT THIS REPORTABOUT THIS REPORTFood Safety 
and QualityAll food companies face the risk of product recalls, either directly linked to their manufacturing practices or as a 
result of using a contaminated ingredient from a supplier. 
Recalls can result in financial and reputational loss.By achieving Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) certification at our manufacturing facilities and influencing third parties in 
our supply chain to do the same, we minimize the risk of recalls 
throughout the production life cycle of the food we make.
Product Labeling Consumers, customers and other stakeholders deserve accurate labeling of the ingredients and nutritional composition of the food we make. Inaccurate information erodes trust, is costly to correct, and has a negative impact on both 
short-term and long-term business performance.By focusing on continual improvement of the systems used to 
perform food labeling, the capability and expertise of the people using these systems, and detailed root cause analyses and corrective actions for errors when they occur, we increase the quality, 
efficiency and accuracy of our food labeling information. 
RESPONSIBLE SOURCING
Agriculture Climate change, water risk and other environmental factors — 
combined with a growing global population — present some of 
the greatest challenges that the food industry must address. Collaborating with growers on sustainable agriculture programs will 
strengthen our relationships with these critical business partners and 
help ensure reliable sources of critical ingredients. 
STRONGER COMMUNITIES
Employee 
DevelopmentEmployees may be lured away to other opportunities in a  competitive job market if they don’t feel they have adequate 
professional development and career advancement 
opportunities. Under-investing in people may increase our turnover rate and hinder recruiting efforts. Investing in our employees’ professional development and celebrating their diversity improves employee satisfaction 
and retention and enhances our recruiting success.
Workplace Safety Unsafe working conditions lead to a high injury rate and poor 
employee satisfaction, increasing turnover and workers’ compensation costs.Improving workplace safety and encouraging safe working behaviors instills a safety-focused culture, reducing our injury rate and costs.
Community 
InvolvementManufacturing facilities risk being perceived as a burden on local communities or passive corporate citizens, putting a strain 
on natural resources. This can result in an impaired corporate reputation and an inability to attract and retain employees.A clearly defined social platform serves as the basis for our 
charitable contributions and community outreach, enhancing 
our reputation as a responsible corporate citizen.
