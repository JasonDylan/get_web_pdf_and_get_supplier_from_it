Reporting approach
We have prepared this report in 
accordance with the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) G4 core level reporting.
We report on comprehensive disclosures 
in the area of governance, ethics and 
integrity to ensure consistency of 
reporting from previous years. The GRI 
guidelines provide a globally accepted 
framework of principles and indicators 
for reporting an organisation’s economic, 
environmental and social practices 
and performance. This report includes 
indicators from the GRI G4 Oil and Gas 
Sector Disclosures.
Woodside has also reported in 
accordance with IPIECA, Oil and Gas 
Industry Guidance on Voluntary Industry 
Reporting (2015). IPIECA is the global 
oil and gas industry association for 
environmental and social issues.A GRI and IPIECA content index, which 
cross references the GRI and IPIECA 
indicators to the relevant sections of this 
report and the Annual Report 2015, is 
summarised on page 46 and can be found 
on our website.
In determining the report content, 
we have been guided by the AA1000 
principles, which cover inclusivity, 
materiality and responsiveness. The 
AA1000 standard provides a framework 
for our organisation to identify, prioritise 
and respond to sustainability challenges.
Inclusivity
We acknowledge the importance of 
stakeholder participation in developing 
and implementing our response to 
sustainability reporting. We sought the 
opinions of stakeholders as part of the 
materiality process which helped to 
define the content of this report. More 
information on our diverse stakeholders, 
their issues and our responses can be 
found on pages 14 to 15. 
Materiality
Issues are considered material if they 
have the potential to impact our ability to 
achieve our business strategy or affect our 
reputation, or they are of material concern 
to our stakeholders. The materiality 
assessment process is discussed on 
page 16. This year we have included case 
studies to support each material issue.  
An explanation of key issues can be found 
on page 16.
Responsiveness
The report aims to respond to those 
issues identified as material for Woodside 
and its stakeholders. Information on our 
responses to stakeholder concerns about 
specific material issues can be found on 
pages 18 to 27.
External assurance
Ernst & Young has conducted reasonable 
assurance over information in the 
Sustainable Development Report 2015 
related to Woodside’s material issues 
and limited assurance over the balance of 
the report.

OVERVIEW
MESSAGE FROM OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Peter Coleman  
18 March 2016The oil and gas industry globally 
experienced volatile and challenging 
conditions throughout 2015, as the 
decline in oil prices that began in 2014 
continued throughout the year. Low oil 
prices impacted profits and resulted in 
impairment charges, but low operating 
cash costs mean that we continue to 
generate significant cash, and the balance 
sheet remains strong.
We reported a profit of US$26 million for 
2015. This adjusted to US$1.126 billion, 
prior to one-off non-cash items deducted. 
This remains down on 2014’s profit of 
US$2.414 billion.
Against this backdrop, we remained 
focused on our commitment 
to sustainability.
Health, safety, environmental, social and 
economic considerations are integral to our 
decision making and key to us delivering 
successful business outcomes. The 
productivity initiatives embedded across 
our business also helped us to achieve 
economic resilience and finish the year 
well-positioned for 2016.We continued to grow our business at 
home and abroad, mindful that wherever 
we work we are committed to living 
our values of integrity, respect, working 
sustainably, discipline, excellence and 
working together.
For us, working sustainably is essential to 
realising our vision to be a global leader in 
upstream oil and gas, and we made good 
progress in key areas in 2015.
We remain on track to achieve global 
top-quartile health and safety performance 
by 2017.
During 2015, we achieved an 8% reduction 
in flared gas intensity through a sustained 
focus on eliminating flaring where possible 
and continually improving reliability at our 
facilities. This is key in our response to 
global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and reflects our commitment to 
developing resources responsibly.
We maintained our commitment to early 
childhood development. The Woodside 
Development Fund is supporting delivery 
of parenting and early childhood services 
in Myanmar, adding to the support being 
provided in communities across Australia.We are committed to high levels of 
governance and transparency, and I 
am proud to report that Woodside was 
granted membership to the Voluntary 
Principles on Security and Human Rights 
Association. This a clear reflection of our 
commitment to embedding best practice 
and respecting human rights of the 
communities in which we are active.
Our work to increase Indigenous 
representation in our workforce 
continues. While we didn’t meet our 
2015 employment target, we have made 
progress in reducing turnover rates 
and will continue to work hard to raise 
Indigenous employment levels. 
Finally, I would like to thank our communities 
for their ongoing support, our partners for 
their willingness to work with us and our 
employees for their ongoing commitment 
towards sustainable development.

David McEvoy  
Committee Chairman  
18 March 2016
David McEvoy
(Committee Chairman)Melinda Cilento Christopher Haynes Andrew Jamieson Sarah Ryan
In 2015, the Sustainability Committee 
continued to fulfil its role of assisting the 
Board to meet its oversight responsibilities 
in relation to the company’s sustainability 
policies and practices.
The committee met six times during the 
year and was briefed on topics covering 
health and safety, process safety, 
environment, heritage, land access, 
security and emergency management and 
community relations.
Throughout 2015, it was pleasing to note 
a steady improvement towards global 
top-quartile performance in health and 
safety. We also continued to support 
personal health outcomes and build on 
the successful launch of the Fit for Life 
program. The program supports positive 
behaviour decisions in three areas: healthy 
bodies, healthy living and healthy minds.
The committee was particularly focused 
on the company’s process safety 
management improvement program, 
undertaking ‘deep dives’ into aspects 
of process safety performance at each 
meeting. This program delivered a number 
of targeted and sustainable enhancements 
to our management system and activities, 
including a revised process safety 
competency framework.Emissions reduction continued to be 
a key focus area for the business. 
Teams in Karratha and Perth should be 
congratulated for the flaring reductions 
achieved at the Pluto LNG Plant.
The committee was briefed on 
Woodside’s 2016–2020 social investment 
strategy, which will focus on creating and 
building long-term community capacity 
and capability. Particularly pleasing is 
that the new priority areas have been 
developed with a focus on supporting 
sustainable outcomes in the communities 
in which we are active.
Woodside’s 2016 Reconciliation Action 
Plan was reviewed and endorsed by 
the committee.
The committee validated the material 
issues identified by stakeholders for 
inclusion in this report and discussed 
stakeholder expectations around key 
issues including climate change.
We will continue to work with 
management in 2016 to ensure that 
Woodside delivers sustainable growth for 
all of its stakeholders.
Note: Ann Pickard was appointed to the Board and became a member of the Sustainability Committee on 29 February 2016.

OVERVIEW
OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY
Working sustainably is one of our core values and is 
fundamental to our business.
Working sustainably is about doing what’s 
right, balancing short-term and long-term 
interests and integrating health, safety, 
environmental, social and economic 
considerations into our decision making. 
It is a core value embedded at every 
level of our company and is essential to 
realising our vision to be a global leader in 
upstream oil and gas.
Managing the material issues identified 
with our stakeholders informs our decision 
making, guides our operations and 
enables us to maintain our position as a 
partner of choice.
Our ability to listen and respond to the 
issues and concerns of the communities 
where we operate is important. For us, 
this means doing the right thing by our 
people, partners and broader society.
Equally important is the need to meet the 
demand for energy.
We acknowledge the world is in the 
early stages of an energy transition. We 
are committed to developing resources 
responsibly and being considerate of 
global sustainability issues.
Innovation and the application of leading-
edge science and technology are 
important differentiators for any company 
here for the long term. Our ability to 
innovate has ensured our position as a 
leader in the Australian oil and gas industry 
for more than 60 years. From deep 
water drilling to production in remote and 
challenging environments, we integrate 
world-class environmental management 
into our exploration, development and 
operational activities.
To be here for the long term, we must be 
part of a sustainable energy future.
Governance
Our approach to sustainability is 
incorporated in our policies, standards 
and Code of Conduct, which outlines the 
principles, practices and standards of 
personal and corporate behaviour. These 
are available on our website:
 woodside.com.au/Working-SustainablyThe Woodside Management System  
provides a structured governance 
framework with defined accountabilities 
and performance requirements for 
Woodside managers, employees and 
contractors. Woodside’s sustainability 
performance is linked to remuneration for 
employees and executives.
 Read more on remuneration in Woodside’s 
Annual Report 2015.
Governance structure
Woodside’s Board of Directors has 
oversight of the company’s management 
and business activities. The Sustainability 
Committee assists the Board to meet 
its responsibilities in relation to the 
company’s sustainability policies 
and practices. The committee, as at 
31 December 2015, was comprised of 
five independent, non-executive directors. 
On 29 February 2016, Ann Pickard 
was appointed.Identifying and managing risk
By understanding and managing our 
risks, we provide greater protection to our 
people, communities and environment. 
We recognise that effective management 
of risk is vital to our sustainable future. 
Woodside’s Board Audit & Risk Committee 
oversees our Risk Management Policy 
and is responsible for satisfying itself 
that management has developed and 
implemented a sound system of risk 
management and internal control.
During 2015, the Audit & Risk 
Committee reviewed the company’s risk 
management framework and confirmed 
that it was sound.
Our most significant risks, and how 
they are being managed, are continually 
reviewed and summarised in a corporate 
risk profile. It is the primary source of 
information when determining our material 
issues from a company perspective.

Managing our supply chain is key to providing 
sustainable outcomes and value to our shareholders.
The number of suppliers engaged by Woodside around the world.Our supply chain incorporates 
procurement and logistics management 
across our value chain. Woodside 
spent $4.21 billion with a total of 
2,670 suppliers in 2015, across a 
range of locations identified in the map 
below. We recognise the importance of 
providing sustainable economic benefits 
through local employment and supply 
chain opportunities.
We have small teams managing discrete 
categories of spending from point of 
planning, through to ordering and final use. 
This ensures a greater degree of oversight 
on goods and services we procure.
Suppliers and contract categories are 
actively managed through agreed 
performance measures and plans. 
We have a centralised contract life cycle 
management system that is our 
communication tool and repository for 
approvals, variations, claims and supplier 
performance management.We expect high standards of ethical 
conduct within our organisation and from 
our suppliers. Anti-bribery and corruption 
due diligence procedures ensure 
appropriate screening and evaluation of all 
third parties with whom we do business. 
All material supply chain risks are 
identified during the tender process and 
quantified with appropriate controls and 
performance measures included in the 
contract and supplier management plan.
In 2015, we developed a Supplier Code of 
Conduct which describes how we seek to 
do business with our suppliers and how 
we set expectations to ensure they are 
consistent with our values. We extended 
the terms of our contract audit program to 
encompass sustainability.
In 2016, we will undertake a mapping 
project of three key suppliers to inform 
the material sourcing process of their 
supply chains.This year several projects have enabled 
improvements in sustainable management 
of our supply chain:
Materials Management Improvement 
Project: enabled a leaner materials 
network.
Procurement Transformation Project: 
implemented new approvals to 
improve efficiency and create more 
strategic sourcing capability. 
Contract Delivery Requirements Project: 
restructured and rewrote contract 
templates to maximise the efficiency of 
contract processing.

OVERVIEW
GOVERNANCE AND TRANSPARENCY
Our approach
The Woodside Compass sets out our 
core values of integrity, respect, working 
sustainably, working together, discipline 
and excellence. 
These values underpin our Code of 
Conduct (the Code), which sets out 
our commitment to ethical principles 
and describes the behaviour Woodside 
expects from its directors, officers, 
employees and contracted third parties 
both personally and corporately. For more 
information on the Woodside Compass 
and the Code, go to our website:
 woodside.com.au/About-UsCODE OF CONDUCT ANTI-CORRUPTION
Woodside has a zero-tolerance approach 
to fraud, bribery and corruption, and 
complies with all relevant Australian and 
international anti-bribery and corruption 
laws. Woodside’s Fraud and Corruption 
Control Program continued in 2015. Further 
improvements were also made in the 
number of contract audits undertaken by 
Woodside which focused on fraud and 
corruption risk areas, refinements to due 
diligence processes for new business 
opportunities, the use of forensic data 
analytics and the delivery of fraud and 
corruption risk training.
Woodside’s Social Contribution 
Management Procedure prohibits the 
provision of charitable donations or 
corporate philanthropy to influence an 
individual, organisation or government 
to make a business decision in 
Woodside’s favour. 
We undertook forensic data analysis of 
information management systems, and 
the use of data analytics to identify fraud 
and corruption risk areas was extended 
to Woodside’s Internal Audit, Finance 
and Procurement functions, in addition 
to the specialist anti-fraud and corruption 
capability within the company’s Security 
and Emergency Management function. 
We delivered an advanced Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption e-learning module to 1,086 
managers and others occupying positions 
exposed to elevated risk. Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption Policy content was included in 
the Code of Conduct refresher training for 
all employees in 2015. 
Woodside’s standard contracting terms 
and conditions with our suppliers and 
business partners mandate compliance 
with Australian and international  
anti-bribery and corruption laws and 
address specific obligations in relation 
to our policies.
 For more information on contracting at 
Woodside, please visit  
woodside.com.au/supplying_to_woodside/
There were no violations of anti-bribery 
and corruption laws detected within, or in 
connection with, Woodside in 2015.All employees undergo mandatory Code 
of Conduct training when they join the 
company and every year thereafter. 
Records of training are maintained 
electronically and monitored by 
Woodside’s General Counsel. Directors 
and managers are required to provide 
annual certification of their compliance 
with the Code and related policies.
Woodside has a zero-tolerance approach 
to unethical behaviour. Potential violations 
of the Code are investigated and, if 
substantiated, may result in disciplinary 
action. All investigations and breaches 
are recorded and reported. Woodside’s 
Whistleblower Policy sets out the 
company’s commitment to maintaining 
an open working environment in which 
employees and contractors can report 
unethical, unlawful or undesirable conduct 
without fear of retaliation or reprisal. 
Woodside’s processes for responding 
to allegations of unacceptable conduct 
are outlined within the policy and related 
internal investigation procedures. 
Employees and business partners can 
use a confidential externally managed 
helpline to report unacceptable conduct. 
All calls are referred to Woodside’s Chief 
Executive Officer, General Counsel, Vice 
President Internal Audit and General 
Manager Security and Emergency 
Management for investigation as 
appropriate. In 2015, there were six 
reports to the confidential helpline. 
Woodside’s Audit & Risk Committee 
reviews reports on breaches of the Code 
and matters reported to the external 
helpline. The company maintains specialist 
anti-fraud and corruption resources. 
There were 36 reports of improper 
behaviour or breaches of the Code 
investigated in 2015. Of these 
matters, 26 were substantiated, seven 
unsubstantiated, and three matters 
remain under or pending investigation. 
Of the substantiated matters, 14 resulted 
in contract termination, 11 in written 
warnings and one in a verbal warning. 
Five terminations were fraud related, and 
nine matters involved harassment or other 
inappropriate behaviour. 
There were no legal findings against 
Woodside in relation to harassment, 
discrimination or equality in employment 
in 2015.

In 2015, Woodside 
joined the Voluntary 
Principles on Security 
and Human Rights 
(Voluntary Principles) 
Association.SECURITY
In 2015, Woodside joined the Voluntary 
Principles on Security and Human 
Rights (Voluntary Principles) Association 
to embed best practice in respecting 
the human rights of communities in 
which we are active. Woodside has 
strict procedures regarding armed 
security guards. In 2015, these services 
were utilised in accordance with 
Woodside’s procedures.
Woodside sponsored a Voluntary 
Principles panel discussion at the Africa 
Down Under Conference in Perth and 
conducted specific training for security 
service providers in Myanmar and  
Timor-Leste. Woodside staff in Myanmar, 
Timor-Leste and Canada also received 
training in Woodside’s Voluntary Principles 
program, and enhanced provisions were 
included in security contracts to ensure 
compliance by service providers. In 
Myanmar, Woodside joined other oil and 
gas industry operators in engaging key 
government stakeholders to advance the 
Voluntary Principles.
Woodside continued its security 
assurance regime with all offshore 
facilities and ports undergoing internal 
audits, in addition to two regulator audits 
and one external audit commissioned 
by Woodside. A new security plan was 
implemented for the Armada Claire FPSO 
in connection with its services provided 
under contract to Woodside.
Woodside reviewed security 
arrangements in a range of countries 
in response to global terrorism. 
We continue to improve our travel 
management arrangements including, 
where appropriate, through increased 
systems automation and individual 
training, to ensure we minimise risks to 
deployed personnel and their families.FINANCIAL 
TRANSPARENCY
As a member of the Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) 
since 2005, Woodside is committed 
to reporting our petroleum tax and fee 
payments with respect to operations in 
implementing countries.
Companies operating in countries 
implementing the EITI work with 
host governments and local civil 
society organisations to increase the 
transparency of revenue flows from 
extractive industries. 
Through this process, the EITI has 
become the international standard for 
improved transparency adopted by a 
growing number of resource-endowed 
countries via the publication and 
verification of company payments and 
government revenues from industries 
such as oil, gas and mining.
Countries in which we have an interest 
and which are compliant with the EITI 
or are candidates for EITI membership 
include Timor-Leste, Cameroon, 
Peru and Myanmar.
 Read more about the EITI at eiti.org
Our taxation policy and robust governance 
arrangements, together with ongoing 
engagement with the Australian 
Taxation Office (ATO) and other revenue 
authorities, demonstrate our commitment 
to transparency and compliance with the 
law. In Australia, where Woodside pays 
the majority of its taxes, we operate under 
an Annual Compliance Arrangement with 
the ATO for income tax and petroleum 
resource rent tax.
Woodside released additional information 
for the 2013–2014 income year in line 
with the ATO’s Tax Transparency Report.

TECHNOLOGYDetermining key issues
Woodside considers issues to be material if 
they have the potential to impact our ability to 
achieve our business strategy, or our reputation, 
or are of material concern to our stakeholders.
In 2015, we built on our existing materiality 
process by:
undertaking wider external stakeholder 
engagement;
evaluating sustainability issues across the 
value chain; and
evaluating sustainability aspects within our 
supply chain.
Our materiality process consists of four steps: 
identify, prioritise, validate and review.
Identify
To identify the material issues, an initial desktop 
study was undertaken followed by meetings 
with internal and external stakeholders. Key 
inputs and sources of information are outlined in 
the materiality matrix.
Materiality discussions and workshops were 
held with employees, community groups, 
contractors, customers, investors and joint 
venture partners. This included a sustainability 
session at Woodside’s annual contractor forum, 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
focus during meetings with investor groups 
and international coverage to ensure capture 
of key issues in communities and concerns of 
government and non-government organisations.Prioritise
We established key criteria to rank the material 
issues, which involved the following:
Company assessment – survey ranking 
top 15 issues, presence on corporate risk 
register, discussed during interviews, 
opportunity for improvement or innovation.
Stakeholder perspective – survey ranking 
top 15 issues, identified as an industry 
issue with peers/IPIECA, discussed during 
interviews, issue identified by media or 
external stakeholder.
The ranked results are given in the materiality 
matrix.
Validate 
Our top 15 issues were validated by our 
Executive Committee and the Board’s 
Sustainability Committee.
Review
Each year we review the report and issues with 
our internal and external stakeholders.
Defining report content
Woodside has enhanced its engagement 
process to identify and prioritise sustainability 
issues that are important to our business and to 
our stakeholders. This enables us to focus the 
report’s content and provide public information 
responding to key issues.
We have identified the key sustainability 
aspects for Woodside, which are shown in the 
diagram alongside and categorised into four 
areas. Governance, compliance, innovation and 
technology are core to the way we manage our 
business across all areas.Woodside’s key sustainability aspects

MAJOR INCIDENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE
Issue
While the likelihood of a significant uncontrolled 
release of hydrocarbons is low, the potential 
social, environmental and economic 
consequences can be extremely high. Loss of 
containment leading to a liquid hydrocarbon 
release from loss of facility integrity, well control 
or pipeline integrity, are all risks that must be 
managed by Woodside not only to prevent an incident, but also to mitigate the consequences 
if such events did occur. Oil spill response plans 
are developed and are in place for all exploration, 
development, production and decommissioning 
operations, and they detail the response tactics 
and capability that should be drawn upon in the 
event of a spill.
Response
Capabilities
In 2014, Woodside carried out its Oil Spill 
Preparedness Improvement Project across 
its operations and activities. This resulted 
in significant improvements in contingency 
planning, competency and capability in oil 
spill preparedness that have continued to be 
developed throughout 2015.
In order to ensure that priorities and focus 
are maintained, a new team dedicated to spill 
preparedness and response was established 
in January 2015 to deliver continuous 
improvements of oil spill preparedness in the 
countries we operate in.
The key areas of focus are:
planning (contingency plans);
capability (contracts, equipment and 
services);
competency (training and exercising); and
compliance and assurance.
Woodside’s access to response capabilities 
include air, land, at-sea surface and at-sea  
sub-surface control.
Competencies
In order to ensure that Woodside will have the 
right people to respond to a liquid hydrocarbon 
spill, the key roles that Woodside would activate 
have been identified and the required training for 
each role mapped out.
To ensure we are prepared, these arrangements 
are tested regularly through exercises and 
continually improved where necessary. 
Exercising includes desktop and deployment 
exercises that test our capabilities and robustness 
of arrangements, and ensures that the 
competencies of our people are maintained.In 2015, Woodside conducted 35 exercises 
focused on hydrocarbon spill response:
22 x Level 1 spill exercises that tested 
our initial response and involve exercising 
the responsibilities of the on-site Incident 
Management Team;
nine x Level 2 spill exercises that tested 
our response coordination and control 
arrangements for larger incidents;
two x Level 3 spill exercises that tested our 
operational response to a loss of well control;
one x Crisis Exercise that tested our 
strategic management of a major 
international spill event impacting the 
company; and
one x tactical deployment exercise.
For each exercise, a post-exercise report 
is developed that details any learnings and 
post-exercise improvement actions. These 
post-exercise actions are identified to close any 
gaps in preparedness or encourage continuous 
improvement, with 90 improvement actions 
completed in 2015. 
Our training capability is monitored in 
Woodside’s Hydrocarbon Spill Competencies 
Dashboard and provides a simple, user-
friendly way to ensure that appropriate skills 
and competencies are maintained. There are 
currently over 180 Woodside people fully trained 
for a role during an operational spill response 
and a further 208 with some training.

KEY ISSUESImproving international response capability
In August 2015, a Level 3 oil spill 
response discussion exercise was 
conducted in Korea for the Hongge-1 
drilling campaign. This exercise 
was a joint effort that was well 
attended by participants from the 
following organisations:
Woodside Energy Ltd;
Korea Environment Management 
Corporate;
Pohang Regional Headquarters 
Korea Coast Guard;
Pohang Regional Oceans and 
Fisheries Administration;
Korea National Oil Corporation;
Oil Spill Response Limited;
Korea Maritime and Ocean 
University; and
Pohang Branch of Korea Marine. Simultaneous translation systems were 
used to support the communications 
during the exercise.
The exercise aimed to share the 
knowledge of Woodside’s Oil Pollution 
Emergency Plan (OPEP) for the 
campaign with relevant responding 
agencies, identify any gaps in the OPEP 
and validate the planned response. All 
objectives of the exercise were achieved, 
and positive feedback was received from 
individual participants on the usefulness 
and effectiveness of the exercise. 
In addition, in September 2015 
Woodside also conducted exercise 
Mano, a Crisis Management 
Team exercise involving a notional 
uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons 
from the Hongge-1 exploration well in 
Korea, impacting international waters. The aim of the exercise was to 
explore the strategic consequences 
of a significant loss of containment 
in international waters and validate 
the company’s crisis management 
response arrangements. This included 
live involvement from the Australian 
Embassy in South Korea and the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(DFAT) in Australia.
Woodside worked with communities 
in conducting its operations and 
spill preparedness in 2015, including 
South Korean agencies and spill 
response organisations.
Testing national tactical response
Woodside participated in exercise 
Westwind, a National Level 3 Oil Spill 
Exercise that tested the National Plan for 
Maritime Environmental Emergencies 
arrangements for the oil and gas industry. 
The exercise was in response to a loss 
of well control from an offshore platform 
and was jointly managed by:
Australian Maritime Safety Authority;
Australian Marine Oil Spill Centre 
(AMOSC);
Department of Innovation, Industry 
and Science;
Western Australian Department of 
Transport; and
Department of Infrastructure and 
Regional Development. 
The exercise involved numerous oil 
and gas companies acting under an 
imaginary company ‘ACME Oil Company 
Australia’, government and response 
agencies. It was hosted across Perth 
and Exmouth to test tactical, operational 
and strategic arrangements. 
The exercise involved a two-day 
workshop that then eventuated into a 
two-day response exercise. The highly 
successful, multi-faceted marine oil spill 
response involved strategic interaction of the Australian and Western Australian 
Governments, international response 
organisations, local response agencies 
and the offshore petroleum industry, 
exercised in Perth. Tactical deployment 
of personnel and equipment in aerial 
surveillance, aerial dispersant application, 
offshore, nearshore and shoreline 
response, and oiled wildlife response was 
deployed from the Forward Operating 
Base (FOB) in Exmouth.  Woodside 
worked with the Exmouth community in 
preparation for the exercise Westwind.Woodside’s involvement in the 
exercise included provision of 
response participants both within the 
Incident Management Team and the 
FOB, and also use of the company’s 
mobile communications system for 
communications in remote locations.

CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY AND RESPONSE
Issue
As an energy producer, Woodside is exposed 
to the economic risks and opportunities of an 
accelerated transition by countries to being 
lower carbon emitters, uncertainty surrounding 
future regulatory and policy frameworks, 
and increasing social pressure for action on 
climate change. 
Response
The world’s energy mix faces dual challenges 
of supplying sufficient energy for growth while 
reducing the environmental impacts of providing 
this energy.
We accept the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change’s assessment of climate 
change science and believe that natural gas 
has a major role to play in containing global 
average temperatures. We believe natural 
gas can – and needs to – play a pivotal role in 
the world’s future energy mix. Achieving this 
requires a stable regulatory framework capable 
of achieving current and future emissions 
reduction targets.
Natural gas provides the flexibility that 
renewable energy needs, as gas fired power 
stations can be ramped up or down faster 
than other fossil fuel plants. It also has lower 
emissions of greenhouse gases and local air 
pollutants than other fossil fuels.
As such, we see natural gas playing a 
central role in supporting economic growth 
and improving air quality in Asia’s rapidly 
developing mega-cities.
Managing our emissions
Since 2013, Woodside’s flaring intensity has 
decreased from 14.2 to 9.2 t/kt. This has 
seen a reduction of 900,000 tonnes of 
greenhouse gases.
To ensure that we continue to improve our 
flaring performance, our 2016 target has been 
reduced to 9 t/kt. 
Optimisation of the safety, reliability and 
availability of our producing assets is  
fundamental to deliver reductions in greenhouse 
gas emissions intensity. This core business 
focus, combined with targeted energy efficiency 
and flare reduction initiatives, facilitates effective 
emissions management at Woodside.  A key emissions management achievement in 
2015 was to embed the principles of energy 
efficiency and flaring reduction into Woodside’s 
Production Opportunities Management process. 
This supports plant optimisation and long-term 
sustainability and has promoted improvements 
and efficiencies across electrical and mechanical 
power generation systems and will be used to 
allocate future investment in our existing assets. 
An energy efficient focus aligns with core 
business principles to increase overall sustainable 
value delivery from our production assets. As 
a result, from 2016 we will set annual energy 
efficiency targets for our operations.
Understanding climate risk
As carbon reduction targets increasingly 
influence the energy mix, understanding the 
impact on gas demand is becoming more 
important to our business.
Woodside recognises there is a wide range of 
views on the risks of and appropriate responses 
to climate change. The most prominent low 
carbon scenarios*, however, conclude that 
natural gas consumption will continue to grow 
until at least 2040.
Woodside tests key commercial decisions 
against a range of economic assumptions.  
These economic assumptions have included 
carbon prices since 2008. Our current portfolio 
of economic assumptions also include a 
scenario consistent with the national pledges 
made to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change.
* For example, the International Energy Agency’s 
450 scenario and Bloomberg New Energy 
Finance’s New Energy Outlook.We believe natural 
gas can – and 
needs to – play 
a pivotal role in 
the world’s future 
energy mix.
Our approach
 
 
Increase use of natural gas to 
support renewable energy.
 
 
Reduce emissions by 
setting and meeting targets.
 
Quantify and understand the 
impacts of changing energy 
mix in our business.
 
 
Invest in new technologies 
to improve energy efficiency 
of our facilities.

KEY ISSUESReducing flaring
The Pluto LNG Plant located on the 
Burrup Peninsula comprises a single 
LNG processing train. Gas from the 
Pluto and Xena fields is piped onshore 
via the Pluto A platform, located 
180 kilometres north-west of Karratha.
Limited flaring is essential to safe 
start-up of the Pluto LNG facility and is 
normal industry practice. Continuous 
improvements of the Pluto LNG  
start-up procedures have reduced 
flaring associated with facility restarts 
by as much as 85% since production 
started in 2012.A focus on safe and reliable operation 
has significantly reduced the frequency 
of unplanned shutdowns and upsets 
at Pluto LNG since commissioning. 
The following approach has also 
reduced the flared quantity associated 
with each start-up or recovery from 
upset conditions:
Operation and engineering teams 
review each start-up to identify 
changes to processes that minimise 
flared gas.
Each improvement is embedded 
in start-up procedures and 
communicated with all 
operations teams.
Simulations are developed which 
allow operators to practise 
implementing these improvements.One of the more effective changes to 
start-up processes has been to reduce 
the time the Nitrogen Rejection Unit 
(NRU) is left offline. The NRU takes 
a stream of nitrogen and methane 
produced in the final liquefaction stage, 
separates the nitrogen and allows the 
methane to be reprocessed. The NRU 
needs to be cryogenically cooled before 
it can operate, and until this happens 
the nitrogen and methane stream 
needs to be flared. Streamlining the 
start-up process has reduced the NRU 
start-up time by 70% and is one of the 
major contributors to Pluto’s improved 
flaring performance.
Pluto has set a three-year flaring 
reduction target, aiming to continuously 
improve flaring.

GLOBAL HEALTH AND SAFETY PERFORMANCE
Issue
Woodside’s health and safety performance 
is critical to our business success. We must 
maintain our commitment to the health and 
safety of our people and communities across our 
activities in order to deliver on our goal of global 
top-quartile health and safety performance, as 
measured against our peers in the International 
Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP). 
Response
In 2015, Woodside continued to demonstrate 
improved health and safety performance. 
While overall performance improved, some 
functions need to continue to focus on delivering 
sustainable high performance.
Woodside has strong fundamentals in place. 
‘Our Safety Culture’ and the ‘Golden Safety 
Rules’ provide a solid framework on which to 
build an effective safety culture. Throughout the 
year, communication across the organisation 
focused on reinforcing these fundamentals. 
During 2015, consistent emphasis on the 
importance of visible leadership and supervisor 
engagement has been supported by simple 
and relevant messaging that everyone can use, 
such as:
engaging others in safety conversations and 
linking these conversations to Our Safety 
Culture behaviours;
checking and verifying understanding of 
the Golden Safety Rules and the risks they 
control; and
improving hazard identification by reviewing 
the risks associated with tasks and always 
asking, ‘what could go wrong?’
A review of recordable injuries over the last year 
has revealed that a number of injuries could 
have been prevented through a greater focus on 
Our Safety Culture behaviours. Learnings are 
being incorporated into 2016 activity plans.Woodside continues to place strategic 
and tactical focus on improving contractor 
performance. Frontline engagement with 
our contractors continued in 2015, and 
work has progressed to standardise and 
simplify the health and safety sections of 
our contract documents. 
Collaboration with our contractors has taken 
numerous forms during the year, including 
site visits to contractor facilities and integrated 
participation in industry events such as Stand 
Together for Safety. Woodside continues to play a 
leading role in industry forums to share learnings. 
Engagement with our peers via IOGP 
networks during 2015 has confirmed that many 
of the themes we have in place are consistent 
with top-quartile oil and gas industry operators.
Woodside will continue to engage broadly 
to deliver on its strategy. Key themes will be 
consistency, simplicity and reinforcement 
of fundamental principles combined with 
leadership, supervision and frontline 
engagement so we can deliver global top-
quartile health and safety performance.

KEY ISSUESAdapting technology to eliminate high risk activities – confined space entry
The Pluto LNG Plant (Pluto), on the 
Burrup Peninsula, comprises a single 
LNG processing train. 
Planning for the Pluto turnaround in 2015 
identified a large number of pressure 
vessels needing internal inspection to 
ensure they conformed to Woodside’s 
performance standard and complied 
with State and Commonwealth 
regulations. Fifty vessels were expected 
to require manned confined space 
entries, a recognised high risk oil and 
gas industry activity. 
The use of remote digital video 
inspection (RDVI) alongside  
non-intrusive inspection (NII) techniques 
was recommended to internally inspect 
pressure vessels. RDVI had been 
previously trialled by Woodside for  
one-off inspections. 
RDVI uses robotics and cameras 
to deliver clear and concise visual 
inspection data and eliminates the 
need for confined space entry. NII uses 
ultrasonic testing, liquid penetrant and 
radiography techniques conducted 
from outside a vessel without breaking 
containment or requiring vessel entry. 
Using RDVI, coupled with NII, during 
a major facility turnaround, was a 
significant step forward in reducing the 
number of manned entries to check 
the condition of pressure containing 
equipment, essential to maintaining 
asset integrity and minimising 
process safety risk.The initiative removed the need for 
36 manned confined space entries, 
reduced inspection activities by four 
days, cut up to ten days from the 
typical 35-day turnaround and saved 
approximately A$4.5 million. 
Health, safety and wellbeing benefits 
associated with this technology 
included:
rationalising inspection tasks from 
the turnaround scope; 
eliminating a number of complex 
lifting operations; 
reducing the number of isolations 
required to be installed during the 
turnaround, including 300 fewer 
spading activities, reducing the risk 
of incorrect isolations and potential 
hydrocarbon release; 
limiting scaffolding requirements 
and minimising working at 
heights risks; 
increasing inspection quality of 
traditionally hard to access places; 
needing fewer personnel on site; 
and
increasing workforce morale and 
engagement in health and safety 
from involvement in a successful 
operation. 
This turnaround was completed with 
zero reportable injuries.As Woodside continues its journey to 
global top-quartile health and safety 
performance, this demonstrates we can 
minimise occupational safety risk from 
our operations. 
The risk-based methodology employed 
to develop the inspection program 
was reviewed and approved by key 
stakeholders from engineering, 
operations, the turnaround team, as 
well as contracted external inspectors. 
The initiative has been recognised 
as providing a platform for wider use 
during subsequent plant turnarounds. 
This innovative RDVI and NII process to 
internally inspect pressure equipment 
has been integrated into Woodside’s 
engineering standards for future 
inspections of this type.
Minimising the need for confined 
space entry, particularly in an offshore 
environment with a reduced footprint, 
supports a key goal of new designs to 
embed inherently safer concepts and 
drive an overall lower risk profile for the 
workforce of the future.
The initiative was recognised by 
industry through receipt of the 2015 
Australian Petroleum Production and 
Exploration Association (APPEA) Health 
and Safety Conference Health and 
Safety Innovation Award, as well as 
the Delegates Choice Award for Health 
and Safety.CASE STUDY
Entry into a confined space shall only proceed if:
Options to eliminate the need for confined 
space entry have been evaluated.
There is a rescue plan, risk assessment 
and a valid permit for the entry.
The people involved are trained and 
competent to do the work associated with 
the confined space.
The conditions of the permit have been 
communicated with everyone involved in 
or affected by the activity.
All sources of energy affecting the 
confined space are isolated.Equipment has been approved for use in 
confined spaces.
Testing of atmospheres is conducted, 
verified and repeated as often as defined 
by the permitry conditions.
A standby person is in place at all times to 
raise the alarm – they are not to enter the 
confined space.
Unauthorised entry is prevented.

TECHNICAL INTEGRITY
Issue
Woodside operates a number of assets that 
have been in production for many years and are 
at various stages of their life cycle.As assets age, integrity and maintenance 
management are critical to preventing the 
potential for the failure of structures, piping, 
processes and equipment. These types of 
failures could lead to a loss of containment and 
deferred production.
Tier 2 process safety 
events in 2015.2Events
Woodside has adopted the American Petroleum 
Institute Recommended Practice 754, as 
presented below, for classifying and reporting 
process safety events. There were zero 
Tier 1 and two Tier 2 process safety events 
recorded in 2015. There were no injuries or 
facility damage as a result of the two Tier 
2 events. Both events were investigated in 
accordance with Woodside’s investigation processes to understand root cause and to 
ensure that appropriate corrective actions 
were identified and implemented to achieve 
continuous improvement. Technical integrity 
management provides the framework and 
systems to minimise process safety events 
and help Woodside achieve its health and 
safety objectives.Tier 1 process safety

We manage technical integrity risks across our 
assets through adoption of robust standards, 
operating within established parameters and 
maintaining equipment critical for safety.
In recent years, this has led to significant 
investment to maintain and improve asset integrity:
continued execution of the Karratha Gas 
Plant (KGP) Life Extension Program targeting 
corrosion, equipment obsolescence and 
ageing facilities;
completion of the first planned inspection 
and maintenance turnaround of the Pluto 
LNG Plant, including novel intelligent pigging 
of the trunkline;
completion of piping replacements and 
removal of redundant major equipment 
on the Goodwyn A platform during 
major turnarounds;completion of North Rankin A jacket 
structure inspection and removal of the 
redundant drill derrick; and
preparation for major dry dock maintenance 
of the Okha FPSO and in parallel in-field riser 
replacement in early 2016.
We are continuously improving our safety 
management systems and supporting 
processes. These include performance 
excellence initiatives to improve process safety 
management, as well as improving our medium 
and long-term integrated activity planning, 
equipment maintenance strategies and 
maintenance execution campaigns.

KEY ISSUES
Maintaining technical integrity
The KGP Life Extension (KLE) program 
is a long-term program to maintain the 
technical integrity of the KGP assets.
This will ensure that regular and routine 
maintenance efforts will be sufficient 
to sustain KGP technical integrity and 
address obsolescence issues where 
required, through to the end of facility life.
Approximately $50–70 million will be 
invested by Woodside each year to 
deliver safe, efficient and predictable 
refurbishment and life extension works.
Key program scopes are prioritised 
and include:
addressing corrosion;
addressing ageing assets and 
equipment; and
replacing obsolete assets, 
equipment and systems no longer 
supported by the original suppliers.The KLE program is approximately 16% 
complete and is targeting completion 
around 2025.  
Process safety 
The Process Safety Management 
Initiative centres on the development of 
a new set of minimum requirements to 
ensure that all our assets and business 
functions have a standardised approach 
to managing process safety no matter 
where we operate. 
To support this, Woodside has 
adopted the Energy Institute’s 
globally recognised Process Safety 
Management Framework, which will 
be integrated with our management 
system, building on Our Safety Culture 
and bound by Woodside’s values. 
The process safety management 
requirements will support Woodside’s 
HSE objectives through:
driving standardisation in process 
safety performance, setting clear 
expectations and clarifying who is 
accountable and responsible for 
ensuring that those expectations 
are achieved;
providing improved assurance 
of the integrity of Woodside’s 
operational assets; 
ensuring that adequate processes 
are in place to operate in a global 
context and be recognised as a 
leader in process safety; and
delivering cost reduction through 
efficiency and effectiveness by 
the prioritisation of the right effort 
commensurate with the identified risk.Throughout 2016, the new highest 
priority requirements will be 
implemented across Woodside and 
its operating assets taking a ‘line-led, 
risk-based’ approach. Key activities 
will include:
identifying and assessing process 
safety competencies for safety 
critical roles;
developing a process safety 
curriculum including a variety of 
training and coaching-based programs;improving risk assessment 
processes and tools to support 
operational risk assessment;
strengthening controls for managing 
critical process parameters;
upgrading of safety critical element 
processes and standards; and

and business functional 
implementation plans to achieve 
the new requirements and monitor 
ongoing improvements.Woodside-operated Karratha Gas Plant, North West Shelf Project.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 
Issue
Woodside must operate an effective 
management framework to maintain our licence 
to operate, comply with regulatory requirements 
and meet the expectations of our joint venture 
participants and local stakeholders.
Response
A disciplined approach to regulatory compliance 
is central to Woodside’s Compass values and is 
integral to demonstrating that we are a partner 
of choice. Complying with laws and regulations 
is important to maintaining our licence to 
operate and is required in all of our business 
activities, wherever we are present.
Our approach to managing and ensuring 
regulatory compliance is consistent and 
systematic, is fundamental to the Woodside 
Management System (WMS), and mandated 
through performance requirements in the 
Regulatory Compliance Management Operating 
Standard (the Standard). The WMS enables both 
discipline in our activities and working together 
as a team.
The Standard clearly defines accountability for 
regulatory compliance, provides a common 
language and sets the foundation for managing 
regulatory compliance, including improved 
visibility and transparency of performance. 
It is aligned to ISO 19600-2014 Compliance 
Management Systems.
Supporting the Standard are the Regulatory 
Compliance Management Guidelines, which 
provide structure and more detailed guidance to 
compliance personnel. 
Embedding the performance requirements 
of the Standard into business processes is 
important to ensure that we achieve and 
maintain regulatory compliance, including:
incorporating regulatory compliance 
management as a clear expectation within 
the updated Woodside Management 
System and ensuring that process 
improvement emphasises regulatory 
compliance requirements; and
integrating regulatory compliance 
management expectations into the 
Opportunity Management Framework 
used in the development of projects 
and improved regulatory compliance 
management when assessing and entering 
into new opportunities.Our regulatory compliance capability is 
supported by a competency framework and 
training program. We have implemented two 
online competency-based regulatory compliance 
training modules: one for all employees 
and the other which specifically focuses 
on the regulatory compliance management 
competencies required by our leaders. It is 
essential for us to have the right regulatory 
compliance management capability.
We are currently designing a new IT system 
to be deployed in 2016. It will further support 
governance processes, demonstrate our 
compliance to stakeholders and be a ‘single 
source of truth’ for Woodside regulatory 
compliance information and management.
Line managers are accountable for regulatory 
compliance management. Additional guidance 
has been developed to ensure that accountable 
managers have visibility in and understanding 
of the regulatory landscape relevant to our 
activities. They will be effective decision-makers 
by having access to the most appropriate 
knowledge and information.
In 2015, there were no significant fines or  
non-monetary sanctions imposed on 
Woodside for non-compliance with a 
statutory requirement.It is essential for 
us to achieve 
excellence 
by having the 
right regulatory 
compliance 
management 
capability.

Building a culture of compliance
The oil and gas industry is highly 
regulated. Ensuring we meet our 
regulatory compliance obligations and 
the expectations of our joint venture 
participants and local stakeholders 
is vital to the ongoing operation 
of Woodside.
Regulatory compliance is conforming 
to – or complying with – regulatory 
requirements, from Acts and 
Regulations (e.g. licences, permits and 
approvals) applicable to our business 
activities. In Australia alone, our 
operations are governed by more than 
300 Acts and Regulations. 
We identify and understand the full 
range of regulatory requirements 
applicable to our business so that 
we maintain a systematic approach 
to organise and manage compliance. 
Our governance processes, the 
accountability of our leaders and the 
capability we have within our business 
give us the capacity to do this.We use a ‘compliance lens’ rather than 
an ‘organisational lens’ to complete 
annual self-assessments on the 
24 compliance areas identified as 
important to maintain our licence to 
operate. The self-assessment criteria are 
based on the performance requirements 
in the Regulatory Compliance 
Management Operating Standard.
Subject matter experts and functional 
practitioners from across the business 
rate the maturity of the control 
environment for each compliance area. 
This provides a yearly measurement 
upon which future improvements in the 
management of regulatory compliance 
can be assessed. Our 2015  
self-assessment demonstrated 
that our regulatory compliance 
performance requirements and 
organisational capability are maturing.Border Control and Marine and 
Ports Coastal Shipping compliance 
are important to the growth of our 
business internationally. In 2015, 
these compliance areas demonstrated 
advances in identifying regulatory 
requirements in new countries in which 
we seek to be active.
The discipline of Woodside’s 
management framework includes 
demonstrating our ability to meet the 
regulatory compliance performance 
requirements annually. Consistent and 
systematic management of regulatory 
compliance across our business will 
ensure that we maintain our licence 
to operate and meet the expectations 
of joint venture participants and 
local stakeholders.

including diversity, leadership and our industry.
Our Leadership and Management Development 
framework continues to provide guidance to 
leaders on building capability for leading results, 
leading people and leading growth. 
Engagement and 
enablement results (%)Our performance
We delivered against our plan, reshaping 
and reducing our overall workforce to 3,432. 
Our productivity program aimed to improve 
organisational efficiency throughout 2014 and 
2015. This has been achieved through reduced 
organisational layers, improved spans of control 
and an 18% reduction in management roles.
Our global turnover rate continued to trend 
downwards from 7.3% in 2014 to 5.7% in 2015.
Woodside continues to increase our graduate 
intake year-on-year to match our forecast 
demands for professional staff. Our 2016 
program will see 108 graduates join Woodside. 
We continue to invest heavily in graduate 
development, this year implementing an action 
learning program to support innovative ideas 
and cross company learning.In 2015, we made progress in improving people 
and capability processes and systems. This has 
resulted in the selection of talent management 
software that will deliver an improved user 
experience to our employees as they manage 
their performance, development and learning 
activities. This software will provide a more 
accurate understanding of talent, capability 
strengths and areas for capability development 
to support global growth. The software will 
be implemented over a three-year timeframe 
commencing in 2016.Reduced employee 
turnover by 22%.2015
2015 employee survey
Woodside conducts an employee survey every 
two years to measure employee engagement 
and enablement. The survey is also an 
opportunity to understand employees’ views on 
the impact of Woodside’s organisational change 
programs. The 2015 employee survey attracted 
a 79% response rate, which is consistent with 
response rates seen in large organisations, and 
is the same as our response rate in the 2013 
employee survey. 
The results show we have a more engaged 
workforce with our engagement score 
increasing to 70%, which is above the oil  
and gas industry norm. Our enablement score 
also increased to 66%.
In comparison to the 2013 survey, employees 
reported having increased motivation and 
opportunities to do interesting and challenging 
work. The direction of Woodside is clear to 
our employees, there is increased trust in the 
leadership and confidence that we are responding 
well to changes in the business environment.Employees also believe there is good 
collaboration within teams and strong 
encouragement to innovate and improve 
effectiveness. The feedback shows continued 
strong commitment to Woodside’s values, with 
very positive results received and employees 
seeing actions and behaviours consistent with 
our values being demonstrated. 
Survey feedback also provided insights into 
where we can focus our efforts for 2016 and 
beyond. Our employees are seeking more 
support with career development conversations 
and coaching, and increased focus and initiatives 
on employee wellbeing and work conditions. 
We have made measurable progress in 
increasing decision effectiveness, particularly 
in the quality of decisions made. Employees 
seek further improvements in the timeliness and 
implementation of decisions.
In 2016, actions will be developed and 
implemented to maintain momentum in building a 
values-led, high performance culture.

Diversity and inclusion
Woodside has an ongoing commitment to 
developing an inclusive workplace culture that 
promotes diversity and equal opportunities.
We understand that diversity in our workforce 
drives performance, productivity and innovation.
Woodside offers an expanded suite of 
training covering cross-cultural awareness, 
unconscious bias, recruitment and selection 
and cultural immersion opportunities.
Employee groups, like Women of Woodside 
and Reconciliation Interest Group, promote and 
encourage diversity initiatives to drive change.
Indigenous participation
At the end of 2015, Woodside employed 
94 Indigenous people, representing 2.7% of 
Woodside’s workforce. This is short of our 
2011–2015 Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) 
commitment of 3.3%. Turnover of Indigenous 
employees has reduced from 14% in 2014 
to 3.2% in 2015, and strong progress has 
been made in developing a pipeline of future 
Indigenous talent.
Woodside has met or exceeded all its 
targets in our Pathways Programs. There are 
currently 28 people participating in a Pathways 
Program, and conversion of trainees and 
apprentices is at 83%. Ten additional 
cadetships were awarded in 2015 to increase 
the pool of talent for Woodside’s Graduate 
Program intake. A total of 23 scholarships were awarded, comprising ten community 
scholarships and 13 scholarships directly 
related to Woodside’s future capability needs. 
Significant engagement with schools and 
community has occurred throughout the year, 
with Woodside now partnering with a mix 
of nine private and government schools with 
strong Indigenous student populations.
The Indigenous Employment Strategy, 
together with our RAP, outlines Woodside’s 
commitment to increasing the participation 
and development of Indigenous employees. 
In 2016, Woodside will transition to its  
2016–2020 RAP.Indigenous employment

Woodside continues to promote a ‘70:20:10’ 
development approach which puts focus on 
experience-based learning.
In line with this, Woodside reduced its formal 
education programs in 2015, with the aim of 
achieving a more sustainable approach. Our 2015 
investment in formal learning and development 
was A$11.9  million. We have increased the 
number of cross-functional rotations by 10%, and 
driven a greater focus on coaching to facilitate 
knowledge transfer and employee development.We have embarked upon a new international 
secondment program to develop capabilities 
and readiness for global growth. It exposes 
corporate staff to international office operations, 
strategies and processes, and builds knowledge 
of country specific regulations and cultures.
The Woodside Production Academy continues 
to provide core skills development for operator 
trainees, apprentices and administration 
trainees. In 2015, we expanded provision 
of in-house training programs for general 
staff development, with the introduction 
of courses on our production and LNG 
processes. It improves our efficiency in

PEOPLE AND SAFETYGender balance
In 2015, Woodside commenced a three-year 
strategy to drive sustainable improvements in 
gender diversity at all levels of the workforce 
and has seen positive progress. The Women 
of Woodside network supports the strategy by 
delivering agreed activities, growing stakeholder 
engagement, enabling personal action and 
promoting awareness and education of gender 
equity issues. The overall female representation 
has increased to 28.2% in 2015, comparing 
favourably with the average of 16% women in the 
Australian resources sector (source: Workplace 
Gender Equality Agency 2015).
Woodside continues to focus on driving gender 
balance through the Graduate Program offers 
and increasing our number of female apprentices 
and trainees. In 2015, the overall female graduate 
intake was 49% and apprentices and trainees 
was 21%. Woodside has taken specific action 
to broaden the pool of future female talent at 
school and university level. Eight gender specific 
scholarships were awarded.All employees, regardless of their employment 
type, have access to the same financial and 
non-financial benefits. This was confirmed in 
the annual remuneration review to ensure pay 
parity between men and women on a salary line 
and job level basis.
Voluntary turnover for women in total has 
decreased from 8.7% in 2014 to 5.3% in 2015, 
and is now lower than overall organisational 
turnover of 5.8%. Women progressing through 
the middle part of their careers have been a 
focus in 2015 and, encouragingly, the turnover in 
this group reduced to 3.1%.
Following strong internal promotions and 
improved retention, women now hold 13.8% 
of senior management roles and 12.8% of 
executive positions, exceeding targets set in the 
three-year strategy.Graduate recruitment

22Emergency and crisis management capability
Woodside has a robust emergency and 
crisis management framework which is 
aligned to state and national response 
arrangements and includes an extensive 
training and exercise program. 
The 24/7 Woodside Communications 
Centre (WCC) and various incident 
management teams successfully 
responded to 83 Level 1, ten Level 2 
and three Level 3 incidents in 2015.
We signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding with the Department of 
Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) 
for ‘Mutual Support in Planning and 
Responding to Emergency Incidents’. 
This provided a framework for our 
Karratha Emergency Response Teams 
to help DFES fight six bushfires near 
the Karratha Town site and Burrup 
Peninsula during the year.
All Woodside operated offshore 
facilities are required to have 
emergency response plans in place and 
to conduct a Level 1 (tactical) exercise 
each week. Onshore facilities conduct 
one emergency response exercise per 
month, such as a muster or response to 
a small oil spill.We staged 19 Level 2 (operational) 
emergency response exercises and 
three Level 3 (strategic management) 
exercises aligned to the Corporate 
Risk Profile throughout the year to 
test emergency and crisis prevention, 
preparedness, response and recovery 
arrangements. Several exercises 
involved government agencies 
and contractors.
Hydrocarbon producing facilities 
where staff are deployed were visited 
throughout 2015 by emergency 
management advisers to assess the 
capabilities of incident management 
teams and to determine their 
compliance with the Emergency and 
Crisis Management Procedure. We 
tested their response to Major Accident

Our approach
Our goal is to deliver global top-quartile health 
and safety performance in the oil and gas sector 
by 2017.
Woodside continued to implement its health 
and safety strategy, delivering on the following 
focus areas:
 leadership;
embedding process safety management 
systems into our business;
improving contract management processes;
improving employee health and wellbeing 
programs; and
leveraging all existing foundation programs 
such as Our Safety Culture, Golden Safety 
Rules and Step Back 5x5.Woodside’s health and safety performance 
is linked to remuneration through globally 
benchmarked process and personal 
safety measures.
Process safety events reflect unplanned loss of 
containment from plant and equipment and the 
potential consequences.
Total recordable injury rate (TRIR) measures 
work-related injuries requiring more than 
first aid treatment.
Together, these two measures account for 
25% of Woodside’s corporate performance 
scorecard that determines employee and 
executive remuneration.Over the past five years, we have 
reduced our total recordable injury 
rate by 59% and reduced the 
number of process safety incidents.

16ContractorHealth and wellbeing
During 2015, we continued to support personal 
health outcomes and build on the successful 
launch of the Fit for Life program. The program 
supports positive behaviour decisions in 
three areas: healthy bodies, healthy living and 
healthy minds.
There was greater focus in 2015 on mental 
wellbeing through a cohesive framework 
covering support services and resilience training 
and promoting a mentally healthy culture. 
A number of workshops and roadshows were 
delivered, covering the mental health spectrum 
in conjunction with national mental health 
organisations. These activities were supported 
with improved accessibility to information and 
services. In 2016, there will be further training 
provided to improve awareness and skills in 
health and wellbeing.We recorded an increase in the total number of 
occupational illness cases due in part to five cases 
of noise induced hearing loss registered during 
2015. While the statistic is recorded in 2015, the 
exposures were over a significant part of the 
affected employees’ working lives. This long-term 
exposure is one reason why leading indicators 
related to noise control processes and hearing 
conservation requirements are so important.
We strengthened the management of 
occupational health by revising health risk 
assessments. This was underpinned by 
the successful launch and implementation 
of software that allows easier recording, 
monitoring and reporting of programs and 
results. This will allow more evidence-based 
decision making and help signpost our journey 
to top-quartile performance.
Our performance
A key measure of our health and safety 
performance is total recordable injury cases per 
million man hours. Consistent with 2014, our 
performance continues to follow a downward 
trend and is below the Australian industry 
average. We are on track to achieve global  
top-quartile health and safety performance  
by 2017.
There were no work-related fatalities within 
Woodside or its contractors in 2015 and 
there were no recordable injuries that had the 
potential to cause a fatality.
There were no Tier 1 process safety events 
(PSEs) and two Tier 2 events in 2015.The number of lost time injuries (LTIs) increased 
from three in 2014 to six in 2015. None of the 
LTIs had the potential to result in a fatality or 
permanent total disability. The average number 
of days away from work has decreased by 
38% from 42 days in 2014 to 26 days in 2015, 
indicating reduced severity of lost time injuries. 
Slips, trips and falls caused five of the six LTIs in 
2015. Our contractor lost time injuries decreased 
relative to employees throughout 2015.
TRIR has improved by 10% compared with 
2014. The improvement in personal safety 
performance is due in part to a 14% decrease in 
offshore contractor injuries due to our continued 
focus on engagement with our contractors 
before and during project execution. On track to achieve

Human factors
Woodside has defined human factors as ‘using 
what we know about people, organisations 
and work design to influence performance’. 
Our approach to human factors continued to 
mature in 2015: 
Produced a set of discussion cards designed 
to challenge us to think and encourage us 
to talk about safety culture. The cards are a 
tool to help us continue to strengthen Our 
Safety Culture.
Supported the Australian Petroleum 
Production and Exploration Association 
(APPEA) human factors working group, 
including developing human factors 
information sheets.Prepared a guideline on Critical Task Analysis 
to formalise our approach to proactively 
understanding human performance relating 
to critical tasks. Applying this guideline will 
be a key activity in 2016.
Developed a guideline on Organisational 
Change and Major Accident Events, which 
defines a process to identify, assess 
and manage Major Accident Event risks 
(including process safety risks) associated 
with organisational change. 
Analysed the role of human factors in 
operational events which will inform our 
approach to managing these events.Contractor engagement
In 2015, contractors represented 46% of the 
total reportable Woodside health and safety risk 
exposure. This includes significant turnaround 
maintenance and life extension work at the 
Karratha Gas Plant, multiple offshore drilling 
campaigns, three subsea construction projects 
and multiple Brownfields modifications. 
We continue to invest in projects to enhance 
our contracting processes and activities to 
deliver improved contractor engagement 
and performance.  Internal process improvements have included 
an overhaul of our health and safety contract 
requirements to align to internationally 
recognised benchmarks with a panel of 
contractors engaged to peer review our 
approach. We have also migrated our health and 
safety prequalification process to an industry 
recognised online contractor capability tool.
We held monthly Woodside-Contractor leader 
health and safety meetings and jointly led 
process safety workshops with our engineering, 
procurement and construction management 
contractors, and our managers made a number 
of visits to contractor facilities. Our annual 
Stand Together for Safety event was also well 
attended by our contractors.

Greenhouse gas emissions
Greenhouse gas emissions originate from three 
main sources at Woodside’s facilities: fuel gas 
combustion to power our facilities, venting 
reservoir CO2 and flaring for safe operations.
Total greenhouse gas emissions during the 
year from all sources were 10.2 million tonnes 
of CO2 equivalent (CO2e). This includes 
approximately 0.11 million tonnes of CO2e from 
the Armada Claire facility (since August 2015). 
Woodside's portion of CO2e emissions was 
3.6 million tonnes.
The 2015 annual flaring intensity was 9.2 tonnes 
of flared gas per kiloton of product (t/kt), which 
is an 8% reduction from 2014 (10 t/kt) and 
24% better than our 2015 target of 11 t/kt. The 
reduction is attributable to sustained focus on 
the elimination of flaring where possible, good 
reliability at the Karratha and Pluto Gas Plants and 
continuous improvement initiatives such as the 
reduction of flaring during train restarts .
 Refer to reducing flaring case study on page 21.
Energy use
Energy consumption at our facilities is largely 
constant, and constrained by a facility’s design. 
As hydrocarbon production rates naturally 
decline over time, in line with normal reservoir 
depletion, this will lead to an increase in 
energy intensity. We recognise that energy 
consumption is a significant contributor to our 
greenhouse footprint and have therefore set a 
target to reduce energy intensity.Our performance
We measure our environmental performance 
against the number of environmental incidents, 
flaring intensity (as a measure of greenhouse 
gas emissions) and energy consumption. 
We also routinely monitor and report against 
other environmental performance metrics which 
are presented in the environment data tables 
on page  49.
Environmental incidents
We had no significant environmental incidents 
in 2015. We reported two environmental 
incidents to regulatory authorities as part of our 
licence conditions. The incidents were of minor 
environmental impact.Improvement on 2015 flaring target.24%

monitoring within the 
Dampier Archipelago
Through the Western Australian 
Department of Parks and Wildlife, 
Woodside is funding a multi-year 
project to improve the understanding 
of the marine environment and human 
use of the Dampier Archipelago. This 
project aims to collect the information 
to support the current and future 
management of the archipelago. 
In 2015, a long-term monitoring 
program was initiated through the 
establishment of monitoring sites for 
coral and fish communities through 
the archipelago. This partnership is 
planned to continue until 2020.Exploring the marine

Western Australian Museum (WAM) 
has a long history of exploring and 
documenting the biodiversity of 
Western Australia. In 2015, WAM 
finalised a four-year project funded 
by Woodside on understanding the 
plants and animals that live in the 
remote Kimberley region. Preliminary 
estimates for the project indicate it has 
recorded in excess of 16,000 marine 
species (the Woodside Collection), 
including nearly 180 species new to 
science. This partnership once again

that inhabits our regions of operation.Biodiversity and ecosystems 
Woodside’s commitment to sharing 
environmental knowledge continues with a 
leading role in the development and contribution 
of metadata records to the Industry-Government 
Environmental Meta-database (IGEM).
IGEM is a collaboration amongst the oil and gas 
industry, government and research organisations 
and other stakeholders. IGEM’s primary goal 
is to promote and understand the marine 
environmental studies by sharing,  
via a geo-spatial database of metadata 
records, studies undertaken in the 
last decade and accessible through 
a dedicated web-based portal.The long-term goal of IGEM is to avoid overlap 
in data collection and to facilitate data sharing

SOCIETY
Grievance mechanism 
In 2015, Woodside reviewed its Community 
Grievance Mechanism (CGM) and 
implemented an update of our procedure to 
provide a more structured approach to receive, 
acknowledge and respond to grievances. 
Our CGM provides a framework for community 
stakeholders to raise questions or concerns 
with the company and have them addressed in 
a prompt and respectful manner.
To support our seismic and drilling exploration 
activities in Myanmar, we have developed 
a local CGM which is commensurate to the 
nature and scale of the activities and takes 
into account local sensitivities. Our activities 
have the potential to impact on local fishing activity, and the CGM was adapted to allow 
for grievances to be received by Woodside 
via a third party familiar to the complainant. 
Following consultation with local authorities and 
the fishing community, a traditional authority 
or respective fishing industry representative 
was identified as the appropriate receiver 
alongside Woodside representatives in order 
to facilitate the grievance process in the most 
culturally sensitive way.
In 2015, Woodside received one grievance 
through our CGM from a community 
member relating to local employment in our 
Karratha operations.
Managing human rights
Our Compass values, the Code of Conduct and 
policies reflect and support this commitment. 
We comply with Australian legislation 
enacted to uphold human rights treaties and 
declarations, such as the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights.
In 2015, Woodside joined the Voluntary Principles 
on Security and Human Rights Association as 
part of a program to embed best practice in 
respecting the human rights of communities in 
which we are active.As our international portfolio grows, we recognise 
and respect the basic human rights of all people, 
and we seek to ensure we are not complicit 
in human rights abuses by others. In 2015, 
Woodside has continued to apply human rights 
guidance to support our activities in Myanmar.
Woodside is not aware of any incidents of 
human rights violations with respect to people, 
communities, contractors or suppliers under 
our supervision in 2015.Engagement and managing impacts
We engage with a wide range of stakeholders 
and local communities to ensure we understand 
potential impacts of activities and implementation 
of appropriate mitigation strategies.
In 2015, we undertook significant consultation 
within Myanmar at the union, regional and 
village level in support of seismic and drilling 
activities in the Rakhine Basin. With the 
assistance of local consultants, we visited 
16 villages in the Ayeyarwady  region and 
Rakhine State. The consultation process 
included discussions with local fishermen and 
fishing associations to understand the nature 
of their fishing activities to ensure we minimise 
any impacts on livelihoods. 
We continued to engage with stakeholders 
in the Pilbara and North West Cape regions 
through our Community Liaison Groups (CLGs) 
in Karratha and Exmouth. Two CLG meetings 
were held in Karratha and three were jointly 
held with two other oil and gas operators 
in Exmouth. We consulted community, 
government, industry and NGOs to support 
environment approvals for our ongoing 
exploration and operational activities.
We worked closely with fishing and oil and 
gas industry representatives to minimise the 
potential for cumulative impacts.Woodside has been operating in Karratha for 
over 30 years. Our community team work from 
offices in Karratha and Roebourne to ensure 
they are accessible and able to respond to 
community queries. We have reviewed our 
community strategy and are now implementing 
a number of initiatives to strengthen our 
relationship with key stakeholders and the 
broader community. Key issues for the 
community remain the resilience of the 
economy and the desire for population growth. 
We are responding by reviewing our social 
contribution focus areas with a greater emphasis 
on investing for outcomes and increasing our 
focus on social baseline and indicators and 
improving our communication.
The Browse Joint Venture has completed its 
social impact assessment and management 
plan for the proposed Browse FLNG 
Development and is working to maximise 
potential benefits including local content, 
employment and training. 
Woodside also conducted stakeholder 
engagement with communities and key 
stakeholders to support our activities and 
interests in Canada, Morocco, Ireland, 
New Zealand, Timor-Leste and the

 Value (A$)Social contribution
Our social contribution strategy focuses on 
creating capacity and capability development 
for local host communities through long-term, 
strategic investment in the communities where 
we operate.
Our social contribution strategy is structured to 
provide support to core business objectives for 
exploration, operations and developments. The 
strategy is flexible and responsive to business 
needs and makes provision for funding and  
in-kind support for all our activities.
In 2015, we contributed A$13.9 million through 
voluntary social investment with our social 
investment going towards a combination 
of strategic partnerships (74%), Woodside 
Development Fund (14%) and philanthropic 
activities (12%).
Our philanthropic contribution in 2015 
was primarily through the donation of our 
employees’ time to corporate volunteerism 
valued at A$1.2 million. There has been a 
growing preference by our employees to 
participate in skills-based volunteering.
 Learn more about Woodside's volunteering program 
on our website.
In 2015, our social contribution profile shows 
74% of our investment going directly to 
strategic partnerships in our host communities. 
In addition, we successfully leveraged 
A$5.2 million of social investment through our 
partners or government bodies.We recognise each host country and 
community will have unique and varied 
priorities and our approach accommodates 
these by identifying relevant localised 
objectives and aligning these with Woodside’s 
needs and objectives to achieve lasting 
mutual benefits. Woodside is committed to 
reconciliation with Indigenous Australians 
and we support Indigenous organisations to 
preserve, celebrate and respect Indigenous 
culture, create opportunities for Indigenous 
people and forge cross-cultural relationships. 
As Development Partner for the Yirra Yakkin 
Aboriginal Theatre Company, Woodside supports 
capacity and capability building through the 
Next Steps Training Program, creating a range of 
pathways and opportunities for Indigenous artists 
and building the resilience and strength of the 
Indigenous performing arts sector.
In 2015, we maintained our commitment to 
early childhood development, making our first 
international contribution through the Woodside 
Development Fund. In collaboration with Save 
the Children, Plan International and Pann Pyo Lett 
through the Myanmar Education Consortium, the 
fund is supporting the delivery of parenting and 
early childhood education programs for around 
700 children age zero to eight years in ten villages 
in the Ayeyarwady region, south-west Myanmar. 
Focus group discussions with 83 village leaders, 
interviews with 360 parents, 20 school teachers 
and 100 school children have helped shape the 
program development and delivery.
We reviewed our social contribution strategy 
in 2015 to reflect our future footprint and 
align our social investment to our business 
activities and impacts. The revised strategy 
and priority areas for social investment will be 
implemented in 2016.

Woodside understands the importance of 
identifying and working with those who have 
longstanding cultural and spiritual connections 
to land and sea where we are active.
The key areas of focus for our engagements are:
respectful access arrangements to land 
and waters;
opportunities for employment, training 
and contracting; and
cultural awareness and competence of 
Woodside employees.
2015 engagements predominantly took place 
with our host communities in the Pilbara region 
of Western Australia, where Woodside operates 
the NWS Project and Pluto LNG. On top of 
continuing formal quarterly updates, our staff 
made specific visits and undertook consultation 
to progress key community contributions, such 
as cultural projects under the A$34 million 
Conservation Agreement.
 For more information, please see page 25 of the 
Annual Report 2015.
Woodside maintains a relationship with the 
Wadjuk Noongar people, who are the traditional 
owners of the Perth metropolitan area, where 
our headquarters are situated. We also engage 
groups in the Kimberley region of Western 
Australia, as we continue to progress a concept to 
develop offshore resources in the Browse Basin.
In Canada, we have been receiving First 
Nation input into our LNG proposal for 
Grassy Point in North West British Columbia. 
In New Zealand, we consult with Maori people 
from the area surrounding the Taranaki and 
Great Southern Basins.In 2015, we revised our Cultural Heritage 
Management Procedure. This updated 
document maintains principles which aim to:
work with Indigenous people and groups 
to develop an understanding about cultural 
values and potential cultural heritage 
impacts throughout our activity cycles;
where possible, avoid ground disturbance 
and places of heritage value; and
if avoidance is not possible, minimise 
and mitigate.
Woodside has been part of the Australian 
Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) program for the 
past six years. Overseen by national  
not-for-profit organisation Reconciliation 
Australia, RAPs require participants to publicly 
nominate and report on their actions that help 
reduce the unacceptable life-expectancy gap 
between Indigenous and non-Indigenous 
Australians. Having a RAP has allowed 
Woodside to establish a set of company-wide 
goals and extend our work and thinking to 
Indigenous people who may not be part of 
a host community. 
During 2015, Woodside concluded and 
reviewed its current RAP. Review findings and 
recommendations, alongside direct input from 
staff, Indigenous community representatives 
and other community partners, informed 
the development of our next RAP. Our third 
RAP has received Executive Committee and 
Board endorsement, and the transition will 
commence in 2016.
2011–2015 Reconciliation Action Plan
Woodside concluded our second RAP in 2015, 
showing encouraging results that underpin our 
strong desire to keep improving.
Sixty-seven of the 82 measurable goals laid 
out in the 2011–2015 RAP were met, with 
results exceeding expectations for 11 of these. 
Independent benchmarking studies conducted in 
2015 placed Woodside in a leadership group of 
RAP organisations.
One stand-out achievement was signing over 
175 new contracts with Indigenous businesses, 
against a target of 50.
We fell short on five end-2015 goals:
workforce proportionality (2.7% against a 
goal of 3.3%);
membership growth of our staff 
Reconciliation Interest Group (44% increase 
against a goal of 100% increase);meeting frequency of our Perth-based  
Doynj Doynj Korliny* collegiate of 
Indigenous staff (met each year, 
but not always quarterly as per the 
RAP commitment);
the number of high school students 
participating in the Western Australian cohort 
of the Aspiration Initiative program, managed 
by the Aurora Project (23 against a goal 
of 30); and
supporting annual public lectures in 
conjunction with Noongar community 
organisations (lecture program supported 
in 2015 only).
Ten goals became redundant over time, due 
to changed priorities for community partners 
and Woodside.
* ‘Walking together’ in the language of the local 
Noongar people. For results of each goal,

Long-term partnerships are critical 
to our business and we recognise 
that we must deliver sustainable 
economic value to the communities 
in which we operate.
Our approach
Against a backdrop of low oil prices and 
increasing competition, we remained focused 
throughout 2015 on creating value for our 
stakeholders: shareholders, communities, 
partners and governments.
Woodside delivers significant economic benefits 
to communities, including employing and 
investing in training for our staff, paying taxes to 
governments, purchasing goods and services 
through our supply chain and producing oil and 
gas that fuel growing economies.
Our vision is to become a global leader in 
upstream oil and gas. Our strategy is to: 
maximise core business; 
leverage our capabilities; and 
grow our portfolio.

OVERVIEW PEOPLE AND SAFETY KEY ISSUES ENVIRONMENT SOCIETY ECONOMICECONOMICOur performance
Our strategy of maximising our core business, 
leveraging our capabilities across the oil and gas 
value chain and growing our portfolio served 
us well in the challenging economic conditions. 
Enhanced productivity, disciplined decision 
making and asset reliability underpinned our 
full-year results.
In 2015, we produced 92.2 MMboe of 
hydrocarbons, generating $5.03 billion 
operating revenue.
Woodside acquired interests in Wheatstone, 
Balnaves and Kitimat, which increased 
2P Developed and Undeveloped Reserves 
and 2C Contingent resources. We discovered 
additional 2C Contingent resources of 
68 MMboe (net) for Pluto with the Pyxis-1 
exploration well and discovered gas in the 
Shwe Yee Htun-1 well in Myanmar.We delivered a statutory Net Profit  
After Tax (NPAT) of $26 million and NPAT of 
$1,126 million prior to the deduction of one-off 
non-cash items. This was due to lower oil prices 
impacting revenue and asset impairments driven 
by lower near-term and long-term forward 
price assumptions.
We distributed $1.73 billion in dividends to 
our shareholders.

Our contribution
During 2015, we continued our strong 
track record as a major contributor to the 
Australian economy. We have generated and 
distributed $5.03 billion of economic value  
as illustrated in the graph below.
Over the last decade, we have injected more than 
$25 billion into the Western Australian economy.
We are also a major employer in Australia, 
employing 3,392 people across our locations.We primarily pay tax to the Australian 
Government on the profits made from 
our oil and gas business. In 2015, we paid 
approximately $1.047 billion in Australian Federal 
and State taxes. A summary of taxes paid in 
2015 is illustrated below.

Our resilience
During 2015, as oil prices reached 11-year lows, 
we demonstrated our resilience through our 
relentless focus on productivity, continuous 
improvement and capital discipline.
In 2015, we raised $4.1 billion in new and 
refinanced debt facilities.
In 2015, we maintained our 80% dividend 
payout ratio and declared a fully franked dividend 
of 109 cents per share based on the NPAT prior 
to the deduction of one-off non-cash items 
of $1,126 million.Our company-wide productivity program aims 
to add value and reduce waste in our business. 
Our productivity program has delivered more 
than $700 million in benefits in 2015 and more 
than $1.2 billion in cumulative benefits since it 
began two years ago. Initiatives aimed at not 
only reducing cost but also driving improvements 
and achieving efficiencies have enabled us 
to meet our commitments with reduced 
operating expenditure.
We are also continuing to innovate to discover 
new technical solutions and efficiencies.

Reducing helicopter services costs
Helicopter costs represent a significant 
proportion of operating expenditure for 
Woodside’s floating production storage 
and offloading vessels.
Other oil and gas companies working in 
the same region were contracting their 
own helicopter fleets.
Our helicopter capacity was 
significantly under-utilised, presenting 
an opportunity for us to share our 
spare capacity.
Woodside’s aviation team approached 
another oil and gas company to develop 
a joint acquisition tender for the 
Exmouth region.
Through this arrangement, an 
estimated $15 million in budget savings 
were achieved.  
A successful model for implementation 
of future regional sharing agreements 
has been developed, including multiple 
ad-hoc partnering arrangements with 
other oil and gas companies.
Helicopter usage has improved, 
decreasing wasted capacity and 
facilitating the use of safer, new-
generation helicopters at a shared lower 
cost than older generational helicopters.
Suppliers and contractors attending supplier forum.
Aviation operations and contracting team worked with other oil and gas companies 
to improve helicopter capacity.Building outstanding relationships
Woodside’s Operations division hosted 
a supplier forum with 39 of our major 
suppliers to explore key topics including 
health and safety, technology and 
innovation, continuous improvement 
and sustainability. The forum identified 
economic performance, occupational 
health and safety, labour relations and 
management, and asset integrity/
process safety as key sustainability 
issues. This event and our new 
SupplierConnect Newsletter is our way 
of improving and expanding connection 
with our suppliers.CASE STUDIES

External assurance
Information presented here has been externally 
assured. Ernst & Young has conducted 
reasonable assurance related to Woodside’s 
material issues and limited assurance over the 
balance of the report. 
A copy of Ernst & Young’s assurance statement 
is on page 53.What do the levels of assurance mean?
In a reasonable assurance engagement, EY gathers sufficient appropriate 
evidence  to conclude that the subject matter conforms in all material 
respects  with identified suitable criteria, and gives a report in the form of a 
positive assurance .
In a limited assurance engagement, EY gathers sufficient appropriate 
evidence  to conclude that the subject matter is plausible  in the 
circumstances, and gives a report in the form of a negative assurance . 
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature, 
and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. As a 
result, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is 
lower than the assurance obtained from a reasonable assurance engagement.

1. 2014 is the first year Woodside has included contractor data.
2. In 2013, Woodside adjusted the calculation to report Total Recordable Injuries (TRIR) and 
Rates and Lost Time Injury (LTI) events and frequencies.  
All data is now stated in line with this methodology. The figures in the parentheses above 
reflect the previously publicly reported data, which includes all recordable illnesses. 
3. Frequency rates are calculated per million hours worked.
4. As defined by the Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 
(RIDDOR) hydrocarbon release classification. Woodside ceased use of RIDDOR in 2013.5. Classified in accordance with American Petroleum Institute 
Recommended Practice 754 (API RP 754).
6. Total Hydrocarbon production includes liquid and gas products that are exported (sold) and 
gas used as fuel. Reinjected gas and liquids not included. International data not included.
7. To align with the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System (NGERS) an 
emission source at the Karratha Gas Plant was not included in the 2012 data sets. 
The relevant 2012 values in this report have been revised to include that source.
8. Edit to 2014 data due to late receival of Pluto water discharge data.Note: The values in this table do not, as yet, take into account the error of uncertainty associated with the acquisition of the raw data and the subsequent calculations.
Performance data is reported on both a total and Woodside equity share basis as appropriate. Health and safety data includes international exploration activity, whereas it is excluded from 
environmental data.

NOTES AND DEFINITIONS
Environment
Total hydrocarbon 
production Includes gross liquid and gas products, but does not include reinjected hydrocarbons.
Total energy consumption Comprises direct and indirect energy consumption.
Fresh water use Supplied by water utility.
Produced formation water Water that is brought to the surface during the production of hydrocarbons.
Health and safety
Frequency rates Frequency rates are calculated per million hours worked.
Workforce exposure hours The total number of hours of employment including paid overtime and training but excluding leave, sickness 
and unpaid overtime hours. Hours are recorded separately for Woodside employees (includes permanent and 
fixed-term contractors) and contracting personnel. Contracting personnel are defined as people employed by 
another company to perform activities for Woodside (includes third party contractors and service providers).
Total recordable 
injury rate (TRIR)The number of recordable injuries (fatalities + lost workday cases + restricted workday cases + medical 
treatment cases) per 1,000,000 hours worked.
Lost time injury (LTI) A fatality or lost workday case. The number of LTIs is the sum of fatalities and lost workday cases.
Incident Is one, or more, of the following: an unplanned release of energy that actually resulted in injury, occupational 
illness, environmental harm or damage to assets, a near miss, damage or potential damage to company 
reputation, breach of regulatory compliance and/or legislation, security breach.
High potential 
incident (HPI)Is an incident, regardless of actual consequence, which could have resulted in the worst realistic consequence 
of Category C or above in accordance with the Woodside Event Reporting Impact Table.
Occupational injury Is harm to a person such as a cut, fracture, sprain, amputation etc. that resulted from a single, instantaneous 
incident. All injuries are classified for work-relatedness and severity in accordance with IOGP.
Occupational illness Is any work-related abnormal condition or disorder, other than one resulting from a work injury, caused by or 
mainly caused by exposures at work such as inhalation, absorption, ingestion of, or direct contact with, as 
well as exposure to, physical and psychological situations. All illnesses are classified for work-relatedness and 
severity in accordance with IOGP.
Loss of Primary 
Containment (LOPC)An unplanned or uncontrolled release of any material from primary containment, including non-toxic and  
non-flammable materials (e.g. steam, hot condensate, nitrogen, compressed CO2 or compressed air).
Lost workday case (LWC) Occurs where any work-related injury results in a person being unfit for work on ‘any day’ after the day of the 
event occurring. ‘Any day’ includes scheduled rest days, weekend days, leave days, public holidays or days after 
ceasing employment. Lost work days are calculated by counting the total number of calendar days from the date 
the person was declared unfit for work to the date the person was declared fit for restricted or normal duties.
Restricted workday 
case (RWC)Occurs where any work-related injury or occupational illness results in a person being unfit for full performance 
of their regular job on any day after the event occurring. The number of Restricted Work Days is calculated by 
counting the total number of calendar days from the date that the person was declared fit for restricted duties 
to the date that the person was declared fit for normal/routine duties.
Medical treatment 
case (MTC)This results where the management and care of the patient to address the injury or illness is above and 
beyond first aid, but does not involve fatality, lost days or restricted days.
Occupational illness 
frequency by regionThis frequency rate includes total recordable illnesses only, i.e. the sum of all occupational-illness related 
fatalities, lost workday cases, restricted work cases and medical treatment cases. It does not include  
first aid cases.
Lost days The count of lost days begins on the day immediately after the day of injury/illness. It includes the total 
number of calendar days that were not able to be worked due to injuries and illness. It does not include days 
lost for one case where information on the number of lost days was not available at the time of reporting. For 
purposes of calculation this has been counted as one day lost.
Training time spent on 
health and safetyIncludes Woodside in-house training courses only. Training records for third-party contractors have not been 
collated by Woodside. Does not include health and safety site or office inductions. Does not include Helicopter 
Underwater Escape Training (HUET) or external training courses.

described above are:
Global Reporting Initiative’s (‘GRI’) G4 
Guidelines, including the Principles for 
Defining Report Content (materiality, 
stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability 
context, and completeness) and the GRI 
Principles for Ensuring Report Quality 
(balance, comparability, accuracy, 
timeliness, clarity and reliability)
Woodside's own criteria for the non-

collection, preparation and presentation of 
the subject matter in accordance with the 
criteria and for maintaining adequate records 
and internal controls that are designed to 
support the sustainability reporting process.Assurance Practitioner’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited and 
reasonable assurance conclusion as to whether 
the subject matter related to each level of 
assurance is presented in accordance with 
the criteria. Our assurance engagement has 
been planned and performed in accordance 
with the Australian Standard on Assurance 
Engagements 3000 (revised) Assurance 
Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information  (‘ASAE 3000’).
Level of Assurance
A limited assurance engagement consists 
of making enquiries and applying analytical, 
controls testing, and other evidence-
gathering procedures that is sufficient for us 
to obtain a meaningful level of assurance as 
the basis for a negative form of conclusion.  
The procedures performed in a limited 
assurance engagement are less in extent 
than for a reasonable assurance engagement.  
Our approach

Limitations
There are inherent limitations in performing 
assurance due to the selective testing of the 
information being examined. Therefore it is 
possible that fraud, error, or non-compliance 
may occur and not be detected.  There are 
additional inherent risks associated with 
assurance over non-financial information, 
due to its nature and the methods used for 
determining, calculating, and estimating 
such information.   Finally, adherence to GRI 
principles is subjective and will be interpreted 
differently by different stakeholder groups.
Our assurance was limited to the Sustainable 
Development Report 2015 only and did not 
include financial data or forward looking 
statements of Management. 
Whilst our assurance procedures included 
reviewing information contained on 
Woodside’s website at the date of this 
assurance report, our opinion does not 
extend to statements, data or information 
presented therein. 
Use of Report
This assurance report has been prepared 
for the purpose of providing assurance over 
the Report for the directors of Woodside 
only and in accordance with the terms for 
this engagement as agreed with them.  We 
do not therefore accept or assume any 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person or organisation.  Any reliance 
any such third party may place on the Report 
is entirely at its own risk. No statement 
is made as to whether the criteria are 
appropriate for any third party purpose.
