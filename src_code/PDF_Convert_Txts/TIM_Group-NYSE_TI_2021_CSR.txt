TIM Group Non-financial statement 2Letter from the Chief Executive Officer to the 
stakeholders 
The socio-economic scenario of 2021, in continuity with 2020, was conditioned by the persistence of the 
economic crisis, the consequent reduction in consumption, the drastic reduction in mobility due to 
containment measures, the gap in the level of education exacerbated by the discontinuity of face-to-face 
teaching.
In this complex context, the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, approved in July by the European Union, 
has the objective to guide and finance Italy's recovery. The PNRR is developed around three strategic issues 
that we consider key with regards to ESG: digitization and innovation, ecological transition and social inclusion.
The TIM Group participates in this important project to favor growth of the country by building state-of-the-art 
infrastructures to manage data and services in a safe, fast and environmentally sustainable way and by 
offering customers innovative solutions to foster a "smart" production system and sustainable lifestyles.
This vision is an integral part of our long-term strategy and is represented by the ESG targets of the Strategic  
Plan.
The objectives achieved in 2021 are in line with the 21-23 Plan targets:
At the Group Level:
• 53% are the Group renewable energy sources with respect to total energy consumption;
• Reduction of 37% of the Group’s indirect emissions with respect to 2019; 
At domestic level:
• Domestic ecoefficiency reached 90% with respect to 2019, well above the target expected by 2025; 
• Improvement of 20 p.p. with respect to 2019 in the involvement level of our people, which exceeded our 
target expected by 2023; 
• Total of 4.9 million hours of training provided, to reinforce competencies of our workforce; 
• Allocation of Euro 60 million for investments in innovative and sustainable start-ups; 
With the activities implemented, we have embarked on an important path of transformation of the Group 
from an environmental point of view. Data Centers powered by renewable energy, compensating CO2 
emissions generated by websites, circular economy initiatives to extend the useful life of company furnisher 
and equipment, the expanded portfolio of services for business customers oriented towards sustainability are 
some examples of this transformation.
To reinforce our commitment to climate change, we have also formalized our proposals for reducing emissions 
to the Science Based Target Initiative, in order to achieve the 1.5°C temperature containment.
At the social level, we have consolidated our organizational model based on Agile Work and the optimization 
and sharing of working spaces, supported by the adoption of digital collaboration and communication tools.
Finally, in 2021 Noovle changed its legal form to become a Benefit Company, by integrating within its corporate 
purpose also specific objectives of common benefit for its stakeholders. The same path was recently started by 
Olivetti.
The adherence of the Group's objectives and initiatives to the best international ESG standards led us again 
this year to be present in the most prestigious and rigorous international sustainability indexes, such as the 
Dow Jones Sustainability World and Europe Index. We have also been included in the new specialized index, 
the MIB ESG, the first blue-chip ESG index in Italy that combines the measurement of economic performance 
with ESG impacts, in line with the principles of the United Nations Global Compact that we adhered to in 2002.
Looking ahead, we believe that the restructuring of the Group also involves the elimination of the pay gap, and 
a rebalancing between men and women in roles of responsibility.
Finally, we aim to redesign our internal processes by adopting new sustainable behaviors. The goal is to be 
energy efficient, adopt green materials, recycle products and disused materials, structure our relationship with 
suppliers in a sustainable supply chain.
By applying this behavior to the entire TIM system, from the refurbishment of a store to the choice of suppliers, 
we will implement a transformation not only from an environmental point of view but also in terms of 
efficiency and risk control.
                                     
          Pietro Labriola

TIM Group Non-financial statement Contents 6BEING SUSTAINABLE IN TIM 
TIM is pursuing digital transformation as a key to social and economic development, reducing its 
environmental impact and assisting the communities in which it operates in the move towards 
decarbonization.
The continuous search for energy efficiency, limiting emissions and the increasing contribution of renewable 
energy enable TIM to move forward on the path to carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero by 2040, by 
improving efficiency indicators and developing infrastructure and Data Centers to provide more services with 
ever lower resource use. 
Since 2020, the Group has placed sustainable development at the center of its long-term strategy, setting 
targets in environmental, social and governance areas, and integrating them with other targets of the Business 
Plan. The Sustainability Plan is TIM’s concrete contribution to achieving the objectives of the 2030 Agenda of 
the United Nations for Sustainable Development, a commitment that is constantly rewarded by the inclusion 
of our stock in the main ESG indexes and scoring for almost 20 years. 
The updating of TIM’s ESG ambitions takes the form of new targets for the three-year period '22-'24, which are 
founded on the pillars of fighting climate change and promoting the circular economy, digital inclusion and 
strengthening governance instruments. 
This Sustainability Report allows for an in-depth analysis of the achievement of the annual targets and the 
progress of the multi-year targets into which the Sustainability Plan is grouped, highlighting the contribution to 
the Sustainable Development objectives. 
The Plan’s objectives, where possible with reference to 2021, were all achieved, with the excellent performance 
of the "Eco-efficiency” and “Engagement” clusters, the latter improved by 20 points compared to 2019, 
exceeding the growth target expected.

Scope and criteria
[GRI 102-45] The Consolidated Disclosure of Non-Financial Statement (hereinafter “Statement” or 
“Sustainability Report”) complies with the obligations laid down in Italian Legislative Decree 254/2016 on the 
disclosure of non-financial information. 
For TIM, that Statement, which coincides with the Sustainability Report and is a separate report from the 
Group Report on Operations, represents the result of the commitment to notify its stakeholders of the 
performances and results achieved in the sustainability area, already undertaken in previous years. 
According to the requirements of Italian Legislative Decree 254/2016, the Statement describes the 
management methods, policies and risks generated and/or incurred with regard to the topics in the five areas 
set out in the Decree (environmental, social, personnel-related, respect for human rights and the fight against 
active and passive corruption). 
[GRI 102-46] The Statement contains data and information referring to the Company TIM S.p.A. and its fully 
consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 (hereinafter “the TIM Group” or “the Group”), as presented 
in the Annual Financial Report.
Environmental performance data is presented excluding entities with fewer than 30 employees7. Greater 
details on this are provided in the Climate Change chapter. More generally, at the start of each chapter and/or 
section, if necessary, the scope of reference is specified. 
Those limitations are not relevant to understand the company business, its performance, and results and the 
impact produced by the Group.
[GRI 102-47] The Report is based on a multi-stakeholder approach involving the joint analysis of actions taken 
in respect of the main stakeholders with whom the Company interacts. For the details on the material topics, 
see the specific paragraphs.
[GRI 102-50] [GRI 102-51] [GRI 102-52]  The 2021 Sustainability Report, prepared annually over the calendar 
year, respects the same deadlines as the Group Annual Financial Report. 
[GRI 102-10] [GRI 102-48] In 2021, following the completion of the agreement between TIM S.A. (Brazil Business 
Unit) and IHS Fiber Brasil - Cessão de Infraestruturas Ltda. (IHS Brasil), IHS Brasil now holds 51% of the share 
capital of FiberCo, while the remaining 49% is held by TIM S.A.. FiberCo is the company established by TIM S.A. 
for the segregation of its network assets and the provision of infrastructure services. 
Note that the information relating to “Fondazione TIM” and “Instituto TIM”, entities not consolidated within the 
Group, constitute qualitative elements useful to understanding the attention to the social context.
[GRI 102-54] The Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting 
Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (in accordance-comprehensive option). The process 
suggested by the AA1000APS principles (inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness) were also considered in 
the document. 
Reference to the GRI disclosures are reported in the text highlighted with the symbol  [GRI no. disclosure] . 
Moreover, for purposes other than meeting the requirements of Italian Legislative Decree 254/2016, the 
indicators published by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) are reported in a separate 
document. 
Those indicators are clearly identified using the specific reference code  [SASB TC-TL no. disclosure].
Lastly, the information on the European Taxonomy is reported at the end of the Sustainability Report.
The Sustainability Report is drawn up according to a system of indicators (KPI - Key Performance Indicators) 
which measure the company's performance and the degree of achievement of objectives previously 
established for areas in which the Company has major impact. 
The KPIs are defined on the basis of:
■the analysis of the GRI, an international organization which develops universally applicable guidelines for 
drawing up sustainability reports;
■the demands received from stakeholders; 
■the questionnaires sent out by the leading rating agencies for the purpose of admission to the stock 
market sustainability indexes;
■the experience the Company has gained in the field of sustainability in over 20 years. 
The KPIs - mainly those relating to environmental data - are managed on a dedicated application system (BPC) 
that uses the same platform used for financial reporting and control. 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Note on methodology 107 The scope of reporting of the Non-Financial Statement coincides with the Annual Financial Report. Also note that the scope of environmental data 
reporting excludes the companies with fewer than 30 employees, as their environmental impacts are deemed immaterial. The TIM Group 
companies included in the scope of environmental reporting are listed below: TIM S.p.A, Olivetti, Noovle S.p.A., Telsy SpA, TI Sparkle Italia, TI 
Sparkle Greece S.A., TI Sparkle Turkey, Telecontact Center S.p.A., TI Trust Technologies, Telecom Italia San Marino S.p.A, Telefonia Mobile 
Sammarinese SpA, Fibercop SpA, TIM Retail and TIM S.A.In terms of internal control of the content presented, the Company has set up a system that envisages:
■dedicated Operating Rules, which define the roles, responsibilities and procedures to be followed by Group 
companies in order to ensure adequate management and reporting of non-financial information;
■an internal control system, active on some of the data categories such as the environmental one, to 
ensure the correct tracking and reporting of non-financial information;
■the signing of a letter of attestation by senior management concerning the data constituting the 
paragraphs of the Financial Statements for which they are responsible.
[GRI 102-56] In terms of external control, the Non-Financial Statement and related data are subject to limited 
assurance engagement by EY S.p.A., the Group's independent auditors, whose Report is available at the end of 
this Report.

9 [GRI 102-45] For more information on the structure of the Group and details of the countries where TIM operates, see the “The companies of the 
TIM Group” note in the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which also lists the Group companies and subdivides them by consolidation 
method. [GRI 102-2] The Group’s main brands are: 
■TIM is the brand which operates in the domestic market offering fixed and mobile telephony, internet, 
digital content and cloud services. The TIM brand is also present in Brazil, where it markets mobile phone, 
mobile Internet and fixed line services.
■Kean Mobile is the second brand for the domestic retail segment. Established in 2017, it is intended for 
private customers only, and offers no frills mobile services10.
■Sparkle  offers international voice, data and Internet solutions to fixed and mobile telecommunications 
operators, Sips/Asps, content and media players and multinational companies.
■Olivetti  markets information technology products and services for residential and business customers.
■Noovle  is the Group’s cloud company.
The Group is particularly attentive to the needs of the communities in which it operates and implements wide-
ranging initiatives and projects aimed at the social and economic development of the areas in which it has a 
presence. 
This was the intention behind the establishment of Fondazione TIM in 2008, which was followed by Instituto 
TIM in Brazil in 2013.
Although the primary purpose of TIM’s business model is to create long-term value, for the Company and its 
stakeholders, the Group has for some time set itself the essential objective of pursuing this aim while ensuring 
a balance between economic, social and environmental sustainability. 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 1410 Offers only basic services.Main Shareholders of TELECOM ITALIA S.P.A .
[GRI 102-5] As at December 31, 2021 , the reference shareholder is the French Vivendi S.A., with 23.8% of the 
ordinary share capital11.  [GRI 102-10] Cassa Depositi e Prestiti confirms its shareholding of 9.8%.
The structure of the Net Equity and the number of shares in circulation are shown in the Group’s Consolidated 
Financial Statements. For further information relating to reports made to Consob regarding significant 
shareholdings, see the Report on Operations of the TIM Group.
During the three-year period 2019-2021, the number of TIM ordinary shares held by Vivendi S.A. remained the 
same; the entries in the shareholders’ register12 show a decrease in foreign institutional shareholders (-14.7%), 
while Italian institutional shareholders increased (+0.7%), as well as other shareholders (+9.7%). 
Composition, as a percentage, of the share ownership as at December 31, 2021
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 1511 The percentages refer to the total ordinary shares making up TIM’s share capital, as resulting from the last deposit with the Business Register as at 
the update date. In particular, following the November 27, 2020 issue of 126,343,913 ordinary shares following the public offering for subscription 
in exchange for payment reserved for employees under the scope of the “2020 Broad-Based Share Ownership Plan”, all ordinary shares making 
up the share capital of TIM come to 15,329,466,496 and this was registered with the Business Register on December 28, 2020.
12 Pursuant to the law, the shareholders’ register should be updated in accordance with the disclosures and reports made by intermediaries during 
corporate actions identified by the law itself. For a better understanding of the comparative findings in the three-year period in question, it should 
be noted that:
- the entries in the shareholders’ register as of December 31, 2020 mainly relate to the recording of the dividend payment on June 23, 2021, which 
in fact generated the superseding of all previous records of that type;
- the same situation occurred in 2020, following payment of the dividend on June 24, 2020;
- the last previous opportunity for similar comprehensive updating of the share ownership structure in the shareholders’ register prior to 2021 and 
2020, dates back to the dividend payment in 2013; this provided the basis of reference also for subsequent years, up until 2020, together with 
partial updates to the share ownership structure in relation to other corporate actions (usually requests to attend shareholders' meetings).Economic value produced and distributed 
The Group aims to achieve a balance between the three dimensions:
■environmental sustainability: maintaining the function of ecological systems, ensuring a balance between 
the use of natural resources and the company’s activities;
■social sustainability: promoting the principle of fairness between generations and within the same 
generation;
■economic sustainability: maintaining and increasing capital.
[GRI 102-7] TIM reports on what it does to achieve this objective in the Sustainability Report, which focuses 
primarily on environmental and social sustainability, as well as aspects that are both of a social and economic 
nature (e.g. customer care and innovation management) and the Annual Financial Report, which discusses the 
Group’s economic performance in detail. 
In order to give a comprehensive view of the Group’s sustainability, we have provided some summary data of 
economic performance in the Appendixes, which are drawn from the Annual Report. 
The distribution of revenue by product and service and the trend in the Group’s capitalization and debt is 
shown in the “Revenues” note of the TIM Group’s consolidated financial statements and the Report on 
Operations of the TIM Group.
[GRI 201-1] The economic value produced and distributed to the stakeholders is shown below. Since 2008, the 
presentation method recommended by the Global Reporting Initiative has been adopted, with appropriate 
adaptations.

TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 16Corporate Governance
[GRI 102-18] [GRI 102-19] [GRI 102-24]  TIM S.p.A.’s governance system is structured in the conventional way 
and provides for a management body (Board of Directors) and a control body (Board of Statutory Auditors). 
The Board of Directors is appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting on the basis of slates presented by 
shareholders that overall own at least 0.5% of the ordinary share capital1 or by the outgoing Board of Directors. 
[GRI 102-22] [GRI 102-24]  The only stakeholders represented in the Board of Directors are the shareholders. The 
assignment (and revocation) of powers to Directors is reserved to the Board, which defines the purpose, limits 
and methods of exercising the assigned powers. 
TIM’s Articles of Association require the least represented gender to account for at least two fifth of the total 
number of directors, rounded up to the next unit in the event of a fraction. 
TIM’s Articles of Association provide that at least half of the candidates drawn from the majority slates and at 
least half of those drawn from the minority lists must meet the independence requirements set by law, with 
the result that the number of TIM’s independent directors is higher than that required by law. 
The qualification requirements for Directors’ independence are established by the CLF2 and the Corporate 
Governance Code of Borsa Italiana, to which TIM adheres.
[GRI 102-22] The Board of Directors in office (appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting of March 31, 2021 for a 
three-year term, i.e. up to the approval of the annual report at December 31, 2023) is composed of 15 
members, of which 11 independent.
On the company’s website (https://www.gruppotim.it/en/group/governance/board-of-directors/
composition.html), each director’s role, nationality, appointment date, slate of presentation, independence 
status (if any) and membership in the Board committees are shown; the CV of each member is also available 
on the website www.gruppotim.it/it/gruppo/governance/consiglio-di-amministrazione/membri.html . The 
Directors’ skills range from specific TLC sector experience to media and content, from mergers and acquisitions 
to risk management and top management in large companies.
The company website also sets out the skill matrix of the Board of Directors ( www.gruppotim.it/it/gruppo/
governance/consiglio-di-amministrazione/composizione.html   item: consult the skill matrix).
More details are available via the gruppotim.it  website.
[GRI 102-31]  17 meetings of the Board of Directors were held in 2021. The Board of Directors carried out its 
usual self-assessment activity with the support of Spencer Stuart (a company selected by the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee).
[GRI 102-27] The Directors take part in specific meetings with the management or external consultants, aimed 
at providing adequate knowledge of the industry in which TIM operates, business dynamics and their evolution. 
Workshops on new technologies and educational-informative meetings are held prior to strategic meetings. 
Updates regarding the relevant legislative framework are provided in specific briefing notes. 
[GRI 102-18] [GRI 102-24] The Committees are established and renewed in order to: support and monitor the 
implementation of strategies and the development of plans and results; ensure the overall coordination of 
business actions and the governance of related cross-cutting issues; strengthening the operational synergies 
needed between the different functions involved in the different innovation, technological, business and 
support processes. encourage the integrated development of the Group's innovation processes. 
The committees currently set up within the Board of Directors are the Control and Risk Committee, the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Related Parties Committee and the Sustainability Committee. 
Each Committee has its own rules of procedure which describe the composition of its members, how they are 
appointed and how they operate: more details are available on the www.gruppotim.it/it/gruppo/governance/
strumenti-governance/regolamenti.html  website.

2 Consolidated Law on Finance.[GRI 102-28] For the 2021 financial year, the self-assessment of the size, composition and operation of the 
Board and its Committees was carried out with the support of the consultant Spencer Stuart, as already 
mentioned. 
The board review is carried out every year (since 2005). The assessment methods and results are illustrated in 
the Report on Corporate Governance. Specifically, in the 2021 self-assessment, the Board of Directors decided 
to recommend, on providing guidance, ever increasing analyses and focuses on the business issues, in order to 
further enrich the Board’s skills and experience, in addition to increasingly integrate sustainability issues in the 
Company’s strategy. 
[GRI 102-19] [GRI 102-20] [GRI 102-23] [GRI 102-26]   The Shareholders' Meeting of March 31, 2021 appointed the 
new company bodies - the new Board of Directors and the new Board of Statutory Auditors. The Board of 
Directors was appointed based on slates submitted by the outgoing Board of Directors and by a group of fund 
managers and investment companies, while the Board of Statutory Auditors was appointed on the basis of 
slates submitted by the two reference shareholders (Vivendi and CDP) and a slate submitted by a group of 
fund managers and investment companies. The Board of Directors, in its meeting of April 1, 2021, confirmed 
the positions of Chairman for Salvatore Rossi and of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and General Manager (GM) 
for Luigi Gubitosi. On November 26, 2021, the Board of Directors acknowledged Luigi Gubitosi's relinquishment 
of his powers and relieved him of his duties as CEO and General Manager. At the same meeting the Board 
resolved to reorganize its corporate governance, appointing Pietro Labriola as General Manager, who 
nevertheless retained the position of CEO of the subsidiary TIM S.A., determining his duties, authorities and 
powers, so as to guarantee absolute continuity and stability in the management of the corporation, and, at the 
same time, assigned to the Chairman, Salvatore Rossi, responsibilities and powers relating to Partnerships & 
Alliances, Institutional Communications, Sustainability Projects & Sponsorship, Public Affairs, as well as the 
responsibility for managing TIM's assets and activities of strategic importance for the national defense and 
security system.
On December 17, 2021, the board member Gubitosi submitted his resignation from TIM’s Board of Directors.
At its subsequent meeting of January 21, 2022, the Board of Directors agreed with the recommendation from 
the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and co-opted Pietro Labriola, appointing him Chief Executive 
Officer of the Company. Pietro Labriola, who retained his role as General Manager, was assigned all 
organizational responsibilities and powers previously attributed to the Chairman of the Board of Directors on 
November 26, 2021. Chairman Salvatore Rossi retained the powers regarding communications relating to the 
non-binding expression of interest from KKR & Co and the resulting process.
[GRI 102-19] [GRI 102-20]  The system by which powers are delegated (the Executive Directors delegate powers 
to the executives answering directly to them, and they in turn to their staff) is the subject of a specific 
company procedure that establishes the methods by which powers are granted (Granting and Revocation of 
Powers of Attorney) and the periodic controls to which they are subject. The issue of sustainability is assigned 
to the Head of Sustainability Planning & Performance Index Analysis (under Investor Relations), which is in 
charge of ensuring climate change and ESG Plan target monitoring and communication, and the Head of 
Sustainability Projects & Institutional Digital Channels (under Institutional Communications Sustainability 
Projects & Sponsorship), in charge of defining and managing social and environmental sustainability projects. 
The first organizational reports may in turn delegate certain powers to their collaborators; [GRI 10221] in 
particular, powers are granted in this way to manage relations with stakeholders (customers, suppliers, public 
administration, employees, etc. described in the Stakeholder Engagement section of this document). In 
December 2020, TIM adopted an Engagement Policy (https://www.gruppotim.it/en/group/governance/
governance-tools/procedures.html), which formalized the matter of dialog with the entirety of shareholders, 
recommended by the Corporate Governance Code of Borsa Italiana (January 2020 version).
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 18[GRI 102-25]  At its meeting on June 23, 2021, the Board of Directors updated the company procedure for 
carrying out related-party transactions3, drawn up in compliance with Consob Regulation No. 17221 of March 
12, 2010, adjusting it to the provisions of European law. It is available on the company’s website 
(www.gruppotim.it/en/group/governance/governance-tools/procedures.html ) and outlined in the Report on 
Corporate Governance (Interests of Directors and transactions with related parties). The disclosure of any 
transactions with related parties during the relevant period is included in the “Transactions with related 
parties” chapter of the Annual Financial Report.
[GRI 102-29] [GRI 102-30] [GRI 102-11] The internal control and risk management system consists of a set of 
rules, procedures and organizational structures intended to ensure the healthy and proper management of the 
company, in a way that is consistent with the established goals, through an appropriate key risk identification, 
measurement, management and monitoring process. Being responsible for the internal control and risk 
management system the Board of Directors defines the system guidelines, verifying their adequacy, 
effectiveness and proper operation, so as to ensure that the main risks facing the company (including 
operational, compliance, economic and financial risks) are correctly identified and managed over time.
The establishment and maintenance of the internal control system are entrusted to the Executive Director and 
to the Executive responsible for preparing the company’s accounting documents (for TIM the CFO) in his/her 
area of responsibility, so as to ensure the overall adequacy of the system and its effectiveness, from a risk-
based perspective, which is also considered when determining the agenda of Board meetings. The 
coordination of subjects involved in the internal control and risk management system is outlined in the Report 
on Corporate Governance. The internal control system is contained in the so-called “Organizational Model 
231”, i.e. an organizational and management model adopted pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001, aimed 
at preventing offenses that may result in liability for the company.
In that regard, on November 10, 2020, the Board of Directors of TIM adopted the current version (vers. 7.1) of 
the Organizational Model 231 pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/2001 endorsing the regulatory changes 
regarding the liability of entities following Directive (EU) 2017/1371 (the PIF Directive).
[GRI 102-33] [GRI 102-34] [GRI 102-17] TIM’s Whistleblowing Procedure4 governs the process of managing 
whistleblowing reports regarding the TIM Group, whose ownership is attributed to the Supervisory Bodies of 
each Group company, without prejudice to the responsibilities and prerogatives of the Boards of Statutory 
Auditors for the reports addressed to them.
The procedure, which also aims to implement Law No. 179 of November 30, 20175 governing whistleblowing in 
the private sector and protecting employees that report alleged crimes, requires that the Supervisory Bodies 
avail of the Audit Department of TIM S.p.A. to manage all reports through an IT application, which 
whistleblowers can access both via the internet and through the company intranet, guaranteeing the 
confidentiality of the content and identity of the whistleblower, without prejudice to legal obligations. 
Reports can also be submitted anonymously, by anyone who is a stakeholder on their own behalf and/or that 
of third parties, or becomes aware of alleged irregularities regarding the TIM Group. 
For each report, the system assigns an unequivocal  ID code which allows the whistleblower to check its 
progress in an anonymous way.
[GRI 102-17] [GRI 103-1] As stated in article 4 of the Group Code of Ethics and Conduct, any requests for 
clarification regarding the appropriateness of one’s own conduct or the conduct of other people, in order to 
ensure full compliance with the Code and the values set by the Code itself, must be addressed to the Chief 
Audit Executive of TIM S.p.A. or to the Chief Audit Executive of the Group’s overseas company directly involved, 
in accordance with specific internal procedures.
[GRI 102-17] Using the Whistleblowing procedure, the same entities must be promptly informed, by the 
recipients of the Code and those who have undertaken to comply with it, of any conduct (including mere 
omissions) by TIM personnel or third parties in relation to work or collaboration carried out on behalf of TIM or 
national subsidiaries of the TIM Group (as well as Fondazione TIM, Telecom Italia San Marino S.p.A. and 
Telefonia Mobile Sammarinese S.p.A.) in breach of laws and regulations and/or of the Code of Ethics and 
Organizational Model 231, as well as of the rules and procedures in force in the Group.
Any organizational departments/positions of the Group and of the relevant subsidiaries directly receiving 
reports must ensure the absolute confidentiality of whistleblowers and the individuals reported. In this regard, 
it should be noted that, pursuant to article 4 of the Telecom Italia Code of Ethics and Conduct, there shall be 
no negative consequences for anyone making reports in good faith, and the identity of whistleblowers shall be 
protected in accordance with specific internal procedures, without prejudice to any legal obligations.
[GRI 102-34]  In 2021, the Whistleblowing procedure resulted in 141 reports made in Italy. The Human Rights 
section of this report illustrates the reports received concerning alleged violations of Human Rights and 
employment rights. 
The Board of Statutory Auditors’ Report states the number of reports received by the Board of Statutory 
Auditors and provides a summary of the assessments carried out by the Board itself. More specifically, from 
March 2021 to March 2022, 13 reports were received, all commercial in nature. 
[GRI 102-35] [GRI 102-36] The remuneration policy for the members of the Board of Directors is determined in 
accordance with legal requirements and the bylaws, according to which:
■[GRI 102-37] The Shareholders’ Meeting determines the total gross annual remuneration of the Board of 
Directors (and of the directors holding specific offices: Chairman and CEO); expresses an opinion on the 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 193 “Related party” of TIM shall mean the parties identified as such based on the international accounting standards, to which reference is made in 
Art. 3 subsection 1a) of Consob Regulation adopted under resolution no. 17221/2010, as amended. Further details are available in “Transactions 
with related parties” in the Report on Operations. 
4 The first version, dating back to 2015, was most recently updated in November 2020. 
5 “Provisions on the protection of parties reporting offenses or irregularities they become aware of in the context of a public or private employment 
relationship.” first section of the Remuneration Report (RR); passes resolutions regarding remuneration plans based on 
the allocation of financial instruments;
■The Board of Directors resolves, on the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, on the 
allocation of the fees determined by the Shareholders’ Meeting (when established as a total amount for 
the body as a whole); it defines, again on the proposal of the Committee, the remuneration policy of 
Executive Directors and Key Managers with Strategic Responsibilities. The Board of Directors is also 
responsible for making proposals to the Shareholders’ Meeting regarding remuneration plans based on the 
allocation of financial instruments for Directors and employees and for drawing up the Remuneration 
Report (RR).
In order to ensure that the decisions taken regarding remuneration are appropriately investigated and conform 
to the rules on transparency and strict regulation of potential conflicts of interest, the Board of Directors makes 
use of the support of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. 
To perform its functions, the Committee (whose meetings are attended by the Chairman of the Board of 
Statutory Auditors or, if he is unable to attend, another Statutory Auditor designated by him) makes use of the 
collaboration of the competent bodies within the Company and can avail itself of the support of external 
consultants who are not in situations such as to compromise the independence of judgment. 
[GRI 102-35] With the exception of the Chairman and the CEO, the Directors receive fixed remunerations only. 
The “Remuneration paid to members of the management and control body and key managers with strategic 
responsibilities” table in the RR states all the types and amounts of remuneration received by each director. 
Details of the fixed and variable remuneration components (including any stock option), benefits and 
severance pay attributed to the CEO, the Chairman and the key managers with strategic responsibilities are 
illustrated in detail in the Remuneration Report (for directors with strategic responsibilities the data is 
aggregate). 
In particular, the objectives assigned to the CEO for 2021 are mainly of an economic, financial and ESG nature.
The sustainability targets used to determine the management incentive system are stated in the 
Remuneration Policies section of the “Human capital” chapter of this report.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 20Fight against corruption 
[GRI 103-1] [GRI 205] Corruption is amply acknowledged as one of the factors that harms company 
competitiveness, socio-economic growth and community well-being. 
Confirming the ongoing Group commitment to fight any form of corruption, in 2019 the Parent, TIM S.p.A. 
adopted the Anti-bribery Management System (also ‘SGA’) for which it attained UNI ISO 37001 “Anti-bribery 
Management Systems” certification through a credited body. 
The anti-bribery management system was defined to support the company in the prevention, recognition and 
response to actions linked to corruption, in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws and the other 
voluntary undertakings that apply to its business, and is integral to the broader internal control system 
implemented by the company.
The SGA includes the following tools:
■The Code of Ethics and Conduct, in respect of which a new updated version is expected to be adopted;
■the Group Anti-Corruption Policy (adopted in 2012, updated in 2019 and subject to further updates in 2021), 
to provide a systemic reference framework for how to manage preventing corruption1; 
■The document “Anti-Corruption Management System of TIM S.p.A.” (updated, revision number two, in 
September 2021); 
■company protocols, especially Organization and Operating Procedures.
The TIM Anti-bribery Management System incorporates the very broadest anti-bribery compliance program, 
also consisting of the Organizational Model 231 (adopted in 2003 pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 
231/2001 on the administrative liability of entities) which also includes the bribery prevention area. 
In 2020, the Board of Directors of TIM adopted the current version of the Organizational Model 231 (vers. 7.1), 
endorsing the regulatory changes regarding the liability of entities following Directive (EU) 2017/1371 (the PIF 
Directive). 
[GRI 205-1a]  The anti-bribery management system applies to TIM and the members of its corporate bodies, 
employees and various business partners. 
Subsidiaries are required to apply the anti-bribery management system or certain controls for the prevention 
of corruption to the extent that is reasonable and proportional with respect to the risk of corruption that said 
organizations are subject to. With regard to the latter, on March 15, 2021, TIM Brasil received its Standard ISO 
37001 certification, and that standard is being adopted also by Olivetti S.p.A., Telecontact S.p.A. and Telecom 
Italia Trust Technologies s.r.l.
In greater detail:
– the Code of Ethics and Conduct applies to the entire Group;
– the Organizational Model 231 applies to TIM S.p.A., the domestic subsidiary companies and the main 
foreign subsidiaries;
– the Anti-Bribery Management System applies to TIM and TIM Brasil, and is being adopted by the main 
domestic subsidiary companies;
– the Anti-Bribery Policy applies to the entire Group;
– the Whistleblowing Procedure applies to TIM and its domestic subsidiary companies; instead, a specific 
procedure adopted ad hoc applies to TIM Brasil.
TIM assessed a total of 280 operational units as per UNI ISO 37001:2016 certification obtained by TIM S.p.A. in 
2019 and reconfirmed in the years 2020-2021.
All of the operational units (100%) are assessed for risks linked to corruption within the scope of TIM.
The significant risk scenarios analyzed regard conduct that can be linked both to active and passive corruption, 
in the direct and indirect forms and in relation to both public and private entities. 
On conclusion of the Anti-Bribery Risk Assessment, TIM identified the following areas at risk of types of active/
passive corruption:
-  general - control environment – governance 
-  procurement, purchasing, supplier relations, purchasing cycle
-  investments (including network infrastructure and IT systems)
-  financial statements, financial reporting, accounting records
-  sales, marketing, customer acquisition (including commissioning)
-  logistics (inventory)
- human resources
-  finance (treasury, finance-banking)
-  taxation.
From an organizational point of view, the Compliance Department, assigned to the Group Compliance Officer, 
is attributed the compliance function role for preventing corruption, responsible for implementing and 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 211 www.gruppotim.it/en/group/governance/governance-tools/procedures.htmlmonitoring the Anti-Bribery Management system in the company organization and, more generally, its 
compliance with Standard ISO 37001 requirements. The 231 Steering Committee is also assigned general 
responsibility for implementing and compliance with the Anti-bribery Management System. 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 205] The Anti-corruption Policy identifies the following sensitive areas, 
specifically monitored to guarantee compliance with the prohibition to accept or offer bribes:
■gifts and entertainment expenses;
■events and sponsorships;
■donations/membership fees;
■buying of goods and services;
■consultancy, brokering, Business Partner;
■joint ventures, acquisitions and sales;
■screening, recruitment and management of staff.
[GRI 205-1b] When the corruption risk assessment process was over, TIM identified a non-negligible corruption 
risk related: (i) to specific categories of transactions, projects or activities, (ii) to relationships expected or 
already in place with relevant third parties or (iii) specific categories of people (relevant positions). On these 
transaction, project and activity categories, Relevant Third Parties or Relevant Positions due diligence audits 
were carried out (Anti-corruption Due Diligence) going in-depth into the type and extension of the corruption 
risks.
In Brazil , TIM S.A. has internal rules that strengthen compliance with regulations and ethical conduct. The 
company also has due diligence procedures and contractual clauses to combat corruption in the value chain. 
In March 2021 the company obtained ISO 37001 certification, which attests to the security and effectiveness of 
the anti-bribery management system. 
The TIM Integrity Program, also known as the Anti-Bribery Management System, sets out a series of rules and 
actions to guarantee compliance with the applicable anti-corruption regulations. Under the supervision of the 
Compliance Department, the program aims to prevent, identify and mitigate any corruption practices, 
establishing internal controls and monitoring sensitive activities by conducting tests.
Included in the Integrity Program, the Anti-Bribery Program ensures the constant monitoring of 202 activities 
considered sensitive and more exposed to the risk of corruption. The process entails the assessment of internal 
controls, the annual monitoring of a risk matrix of sensitive activities, action plans and the identification of 
opportunities for improvement in these processes and the defense mechanisms. 
To support best practices and constant improvement, the institutional documents of the TIM Integrity Program 
were recently updated: Code of Ethics and Conduct (latest version dated March 2021); Anti-Bribery Policy 
(latest version dated December 2020); Organizational Model (latest version dated February 2021); Conflict of 
Interest Policy (latest version dated July 2020); Related-Party Transactions Policy (latest version dated October 
2020) and the Anti-Bribery System Manual (latest version dated July 2021).
[GRI 1033] [GRI 205] The Head of the Compliance Department is appointed by the Board of Directors of the 
Company to which it reports. 
The variable short-term remuneration plan (MBO) assigns the Head of Department objectives in keeping with 
the so-called predicate offenses under Legislative Decree 231/2001 and applying that set forth by ISO 37001, in 
compliance with the relative regulations.
The Group adopts the Whistleblowing Procedure that, unless specifically forbidden by local laws, encourages 
and allows employees and third parties in general to report an attempted, suspected or effective corruption 
action, in good faith or based on a reasonable conviction, by reporting it to the TIM Audit Department. For that 
purpose, a single report transmission channel is available thus allowing reports to be managed with a 
maximum guarantee of confidentiality and protects those making a report in good forth or based on a 
reasonable conviction, of an attempted, suspected or effective action of corruption or a breach of the Code of 
Ethics and Conduct and/or the 231 Organizational Model and/or the Anti-corruption Policy against reprisals. 
The Whistleblowing Procedure does not apply to Telecom Italia Capital Luxembourg and Telecom Italia 
Finance Luxembourg.
[GRI 205-3a] [GRI 205-3b] [GRI 205-3d]  No incident of corruption has been verified in the Group companies in 
the past 3 years, nor have any legal proceedings been started on grounds of corruption against Group 
companies in the same period. It follows that none of the Group’s companies recorded penalties or concluded 
plea bargains in relation to corruption in the last three years. 
[GRI 205-3c] With regard to suppliers, in the past 3 years TIM has never terminated a contract for reasons 
related to corruption. 
The Group’s commitment to the topic is also demonstrated by its participation in various working groups. 
TIM is a member of the “231 and Legality” Working Group organized as part of the Confindustria initiatives and 
during the course of 2018 contributed to the drafting of the new Confindustria Guidelines. 
In addition, TIM participates in the working groups set up at B20 for the implementation of the 
recommendations made at G20/B20 level on anti-corruption matters.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 222 Contracts; legal, administrative and arbitration proceedings, authorizations and licenses; dealings with institutions and public authorities and their

the variable component of employee remuneration; health, safety and the environment; investments; business partners; payments; acquisitions 
and disposals of equity investments and/or incorporation of companies and operations carried out directly by the CEO of TIM.[GRI 103-3] [GRI 205]  At the end of 2018, TIM took part in a survey conducted by Transparency International 
amongst the main Italian companies in the private sector to map the anti-corruption commitment. It was 
concluded with an index on transparency (Business Index on Transparency-BIT).
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 205]  Moreover, since 2016, TIM has participated in the Business 
Integrity Forum promoted by Transparency Italia to develop activities in the private sector relating to cultural 
programs and the dissemination of tools to support integrity, transparency and anti-corruption. From this 
perspective, in October 2021, TIM participated in BIF TALKS, an initiative of Transparency International Italia, in 
partnership with the Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna of Pisa focusing on the contribution of new technology to 
preventing crimes and the adoption of actions in favor of the private and public sectors.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 205]  The document “Anti-corruption Management System of TIM 
S.A.”, the Anti-corruption Policy, the 231 Organizational Model and the Code of Ethics and Conduct are 
communicated to employees through specific initiatives and are published on the intranet portal. The 
Organizational Model 231 (General Section), Code of Ethics and Conduct and the Anti-Corruption Policy are 
communicated to third party recipients through publication on the website, whereas third parties doing 
business with Group companies are obliged to commit contractually to complying with the principles laid out in 
those documents.
TIM regularly provides suitable, appropriate training to corporate bodies and employees on anti-corruption 
subjects as well as on application of the Organizational Model 231. 
As part of the on-boarding training for new recruits to TIM S.p.A., specific anti-corruption is also provided. With 
regard to 2021, the on-boarding of new hires continued, for which a specific session on the following issues was 
planned: Compliance in the TIM Group the Organizational Model 231 and the Anti-Bribery Management System 
(three sessions for a total of 334 participants).
TIM also provides periodic targeted training campaigns, which are held when internal regulations, such as the 
Organizational Model 231, are updated. 
Moreover, managerial training was held for the following Group companies: Telsy S.p.A., Olivetti S.p.A., TI 
Sparkle S.p.A. and TeleContact Center S.p.A.
In November 2020, the video lesson on ISO 37001 TIM’s Anti-Bribery Management System was launched, 
dedicated to the entire company (12,576 views at December 31, 2020 in TIM and its Subsidiary Companies; 
23,095 views at December 31, 2021), while during 2021 an e-learning course was developed on the 
Organizational Model 231, targeted to all employees of TIM S.p.A. and the Italian subsidiaries of the Group 
(around 42,000 resources), which will be usable starting from the first half of 2022.
Periodically, the Compliance Department sends all first and second reporting levels in the organization a 
‘compliance summary’ containing the main regulatory and legal changes also on anti-corruption and the 
liability of entities.

Italian Competition Authority Case A428
At the conclusion of case A428, in May 2013, AGCM (Italian Competition Authority) imposed two administrative 
fines of 88,182,000 euros and 15,612,000 euros on TIM for abuse of its dominant position. The Company 
allegedly (i) hindered or delayed activation of access services requested by OLOs through unjustified and 
spurious refusals; (ii) offered its access services to end users at economic and technical conditions that 
allegedly could not be matched by competitors purchasing wholesale access services from TIM itself, only in 
those geographic areas of the Country where disaggregated access services to the local network are available, 
and hence where other operators can compete more effectively with the Company.
TIM appealed against the decision before the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) for Lazio, applying for 
payment of the fine to be suspended. In particular, it alleged: infringement of its rights to defend itself in the 
proceedings, the circumstance that the organizational choices challenged by AGCM and allegedly at the base 
of the abuse of the OLO provisioning processes had been the subject of specific rulings made by the industry 
regulator (AGCom), the circumstance that the comparative examination of the internal/external provisioning 
processes had in fact shown better results for the OLOs than for the TIM retail department (hence the lack of 
any form of inequality of treatment and/or opportunistic behavior by TIM), and (regarding the second abuse) 
the fact that the conduct was structurally unsuitable to reduce the margins of the OLOs.
In May 2014, the judgment of the Lazio Regional Administrative Court was published, rejecting TIM's appeal 
and confirming the fines imposed in the original order challenged. In September 2014 the Company appealed 
against this decision.
In May 2015, with the judgment no. 2497/15, the Council of State found the decision of the court of first 
instance did not present the deficiencies alleged by TIM and confirmed the AGCM ruling. The company had 
already proceeded to pay the fines and the accrued interest.
In a decision notified in July 2015, AGCM started proceedings for non-compliance against TIM, to ascertain if 
the Company had respected the refrain notice to comply requiring it to refrain from undertaking behaviors 
analogous to those that were the object of the breach ascertained with the concluding decision in case A428 
dated May 2013.
On January 13, 2017, TIM was served notice of AGCM’s (the Italian Competition Authority) final assessment, 
which recognized that TIM had complied in full with the A428 decision and, as such, the conditions for the 
imposition of a fine for non-compliance were not present.
AGCM recognizes, furthermore, that TIM's behavior subsequently to the 2013 proceedings has been directed 
towards continuous improvement of its performance in the supply of wholesale access services concerning not 
only the services which were the subject of the investigation, but also the new super-fast broadband access 
services. In assessing compliance, AGCM recognized the positive impact of the implementation, albeit not yet 
completed, of TIM's New Equivalence Model (NEM). The AGCM decision orders TIM to: (i) proceed with the 
implementation of the NEM until its completion which is expected to be by April 30, 2017; (ii) to inform the 
Authority about the performance levels of the systems for providing wholesale access services and about the 
completion of the corresponding internal reorganization plan by the end of May 2017. The Company quickly 
complied with both orders, and AGCOM communicated its satisfaction on August 9, 2017.
Vodafone disputed the final decision adopted by the AGCM on the non-compliance proceeding with the Lazio 
Regional Administrative Court. TIM filed an appearance, as in the other lawsuits filed in March 2017 by the 
operators CloudItalia, KPNQWest Italia and Digitel.
Vodafone (A428) 
In August 2013, Vodafone, as incorporating company of operator Teletu, submitted to the Milan Court a huge 
claim for damages for presumed abusive and anticompetitive conduct (founded principally on AGCM case 
A428) which TIM allegedly implemented in the period 2008 - 2013. The pecuniary claim was quantified by 
Vodafone as an estimated sum of between 876 million euros and 1,029 million euros.
In particular, Vodafone alleged technical boycotting activities, with refusal to activate lines requested for 
Teletu customers (in the period from 2008 to the month of June 2013), together with the adoption of allegedly 
abusive price policies for wholesale network access services (period from 2008 to the month of June 2013). 
Furthermore, the other party complained of the presumed application of discounts to business customers 
greater than those envisaged ("margin squeezing") and the carrying out of presumed illegal and 
anticompetitive win-back practices (in the period from the second half of 2012 to the month of June 2013). 
TIM filed an appearance, challenging the claims made by the other party regarding the merits and the amount 
and making a counterclaim. Following the August 2016 decision by the Court of Cassation which confirmed 
that the Milan Court had jurisdiction to decide the dispute, the merits of the case will be decided at the hearing 
in December 2016.
With a writ of summons dated May 28, 2015 before the Milan Court, Vodafone has advanced further claims for 
damages, based on the same ICA case A428 and referring to alleged damages it suffered in the period July 
2013 - December 2014 (and therefore over a period of time subsequent to the period of the similar 
compensatory judgment mentioned above), for approximately 568.5 million euros.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 24The case also contains a reservation of further damages to be quantified, during the proceedings, for the 
following periods, the plaintiff alleging that the presumed abusive conduct of TIM continued. TIM filed an 
appearance, challenging the claims made by the other party regarding the merits and the amount and making 
a counterclaim.
By order of October 6, 2016, the judge received Vodafone’s application for the two A428 lawsuits brought by it 
to be joined. At the end of the reinstatement proceedings of December 21, the terms were established for the 
preliminary briefs and a hearing was fixed for July 11, 2017 for the admission of evidence. When the first 
preliminary brief was filed, following the favorable outcome for TIM of proceedings A428C (which confirmed 
the absence of improper conduct by the Company under A428 after 2011), Vodafone decided nonetheless to 
file further claims for 2015-2016, thus restating its total claim to be 1,812 million euros, which was also disputed 
and rebutted by TIM.
The case was settled as part of a global settlement with Vodafone.
Colt Technology Services
With writ of summons before the Milan Court served in August 2015, the operator Colt Technology Services 
filed a claim for damages based on the A428 decision, requesting compensation for alleged damages suffered 
from 2009 to 2011 as a result of purportedly inefficient and discriminatory conduct by TIM in the wholesale 
service supply process. The damage claimed was quantified as 27 million euros in loss of profits for the alleged 
non-acquisition of new customers, or for the alleged impossibility of supplying new services to the customers it 
had already acquired; the other party also formulated a request for compensation for the damages to its 
image and commercial reputation. This case follows the extrajudicial claim for approximately 23 million euros, 
previously advanced by Colt in June 2015, which the Company rejected in its entirety. TIM filed an appearance, 
contesting all of the plaintiff’s allegations. 
COMM 3000 S.p.A. (formerly KPNQWest Italia S.p.A.)
With writ of summons before the Rome Court, COMM 3000 S.p.A.(formerly KPNQWest Italia S.p.A.) filed a 
claim for damages for a total of 37 million euros in compensation for alleged anticompetitive and abusive 
conduct over the period 2009–2011, in the form of technical boycotting (refusals to activate wholesale services 
– KOs); the claim was based on the contents of the decision of AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) that 
settled the A428 case. TIM filed an appearance, contesting all of the plaintiff’s allegations. In the judgment 
with ruling in April 2019, the Court of Rome partially received the petitions of COMM 3000 S.p.A. (formerly 
KPNQWest Italia S.p.A.), sentencing TIM to pay an amount significantly lower than the amount in the 
counterparty's claim for damages. In June 2019, TIM appealed against the judgment. In the judgment given in 
April 2021, the Court of Appeal of Rome partly upheld TIM’s appeal, reducing the amount of the compensation 
due to COMM 3000, which was in any case entirely covered by the relevant provision. In November 2021, TIM 
has appealed to the Court of Cassation over the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Rome in.
Teleunit
With a writ of summons issued in October 2009 before the Milan Appeal Court, Teleunit asked that TIM alleged 
acts of abuse of its dominant position in the premium services market be ascertained. The plaintiff quantified 
its damages at a total of approximately 362 million euros. TIM filed an appearance, contesting the claims of 
the other party.
After the judgment of January 2014 with which the Court of Appeal declared that it was not competent in this 
matter and referred the case to the Court, Teleunit reinstated the case before the Milan Court the following 
April. TIM filed an appearance in the reinstated proceedings challenging the plaintiff’s claims.
In its judgment of May 2017, the Milan Court rejected Teleunit's claim in its entirety, and ordered the company 
to pay the legal costs of the case. This judgment was appealed by Teleunit, in June 2017, before the Milan 
Court of Appeal. TIM filed an appeal challenging the arguments presented by the other party and asking that 
the judgment at first instance be fully confirmed. With an order in March 2018 the Milan Court of Appeal 
declared Teleunit's appeal pursuant to art. 348-bis of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure to be manifestly 
without foundation, and hence inadmissible. In May 2018 Teleunit appealed the judgment of the Court of 
Appeal to the Court of Cassation. TIM lodged a counter-appeal seeking confirmation in full of the order being 
appealed (and thus of the judgment at first instance).
MC-Link
With writ of summons before the Rome Court, MC-Link filed a claim for damages for a total of 51 million euros 
in compensation for alleged anticompetitive and abusive conduct over the period 2009–2012, in the form of 
technical boycotting (refusals to activate wholesale services – KOs). The claim was based on the contents of 
the decision of AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) that settled the A428 case. TIM filed an appearance, 
contesting all of the plaintiff’s allegations. In August 2021, the case was settled as part of a global settlement 
with the opposing party.
Eutelia and Clouditalia Telecomunicazioni
With a writ of summons dated May 2020, Eutelia in Extraordinary Administration and Clouditalia 
Telecomunicazioni S.p.A., purchaser of Eutelia's TLC branch, brought an action against TIM before the Court of 
Rome, making claims for damages, of around 40 million euros, for damages allegedly suffered, in the period 
2009-2012, following the technical boycott and margin squeeze conduct, subject of the AGCM A428 procedure. 
TIM filed an appearance, contesting the claims made by the opposing party and formulating a counterclaim, 
subject to quantification of the damages incurred during the proceedings.
Italian Competition Authority Case I761
With a ruling issued on July 10, 2013, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) extended to TIM the 
investigation started in March of the same year into some firms active in the fixed network maintenance 
sector. The investigation aims to establish if an agreement exists that is prohibited under article 101 of the 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 25Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The proceedings were initiated after Wind filed two 
complaints in which AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) was informed that, based on an invitation to bid 
for the assignment of network corrective maintenance services, it had encountered substantial uniformity of 
prices offered by the aforementioned enterprises and a significant difference from the offers submitted 
subsequently by other and different companies.
AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) alleged that TIM carried out a role of coordinating the other parts of 
the procedure, both during the formulation of the offers requested by Wind and in relation to the positions 
represented to Italian Communications Authority.
TIM challenged these proceedings before the Regional Administrative Court, sustaining that the ICA does not 
have competence in this matter.
On July 7, 2014, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) notified the objective extension of the proceedings to 
check if the Company, abusing its dominant position, put in place initiatives that might influence the conditions 
of the offer of accessory technical services when the offers of the maintenance businesses to Wind and 
Fastweb were being formulated. With the extension provision, the Authority has also extended the deadline 
for closing the proceedings from the original date of July 31, 2014 to July 31, 2015. This extension was also 
challenged before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court sustaining that the Italian Competition Authority 
does not have competence in this matter.
In November 2014, for reasons of procedural economy and also convinced that it was acting legitimately, TIM 
presented to the Authority a proposal of undertakings in order to resolve the competition concerns subject of 
the investigation. On December 19, 2014, AGCM issued its decision finding that the undertakings were not 
clearly unfounded and subsequently ordered their publication for market testing.
On March 25, 2015, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) definitively rejected the aforesaid undertakings, 
considering them not suitable for removing the anticompetitive aspects investigated.
On July 21, 2015 the Communication of the Results of the Investigation was served on the parties to the 
proceedings, in which the Offices of AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) expressed their position in the 
sense of (i) archiving the complaints regarding the abuse of dominant position and (ii) confirming, instead, that 
there exists between TIM and the maintenance firms an agreement to coordinate the economic offers drawn 
up for Wind and Fastweb, and to prevent the unbundled supply of the ancillary technical services.
On December 16, 2015, the final order was issued, confirming the conclusions of the Communication of the 
Results of the Investigation, sustaining that, between 2012 and 2013, there existed an agreement that 
restricted competition, and as a result imposed a fine of 21.5 million euros on the Company, paid in March 
2016. The relevant market is that for corrective maintenance (assurance) services, or, more precisely, 
troubleshooting on TIM LLU lines. The purpose of the conduct maintained by the Company and the network 
firms would have been to limit competition and prevent the evolution of forms of unbundled supply of ancillary 
technical services.
TIM appealed the order before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court. In judgment no. 09554/2016 issued in 
September 2016, the appeal was dismissed, and the Company appealed this decision to the Council of State. 
On the outcome of the proceedings, with the judgment of December 2019, the Council of State, deciding in 
favor of TIM, annulled the AGCM I761 provision and referred the task of conducting a new investigation to 
AGCM, within the limits that decided by the Council of State itself. In 2020, TIM obtained the return of amounts 
paid by way of sanction.
Following analysis, in a letter dated April 2, 2021, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) reported that it had 
archived case I761.
Vodafone (I761)
With a writ of summons before the Milan Court, Vodafone has sued TIM and some network companies, 
bringing claims for damages from the Company for around 193 million euros for damages arising from alleged 
anti-competitive conduct censured in the known AGCM case I-761 (on corrective maintenance) referring to the 
period from 2011 to 2017.
Vodafone claimed that TIM had allegedly infringed antitrust regulations in the wholesale markets for access to 
its fixed-line network (LLU lines; Bitstream; WLR) through the abuse of a dominant position and an unlawful 
agreement with maintenance companies to maintain a monopoly on the offer of corrective maintenance 
services on its network. Specifically, the restrictive agreement allegedly concerned the coordination, by the 
Company, of the economic terms and conditions contained in the bids for maintenance services prepared by 
the aforementioned companies for OAOs, with artificially high prices with respect to the cost of the 
maintenance included in the regulated access fee, with a view to discouraging the disaggregation of the 
service itself. The Company filed an appearance, contesting all of the other party’s requests. The case was 
settled as part of a global settlement with Vodafone.
Italian Competition Authority Case A514
In June 2017  AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) started proceedings A514 against TIM, to ascertain a 
possible abuse of its dominant market position in breach of article 102 of the “Treaty on the Functioning of the 
European Union”. The proceedings were started based on some complaints filed in May and June 2017, by 
Infratel, Enel, Open Fiber, Vodafone and Wind Tre, and concerns a presumed abuse of TIM's dominant position 
in the market for wholesale access services and for retail services using the broadband and ultrabroadband 
fixed network. In particular, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) hypothesized that TIM had adopted 
conduct aimed at: i) slowing and hindering the course of the Infratel tender processes so as to delay, or render 
less remunerative the entry of another operator in the wholesale market; ii) preemptively securing customers 
on the retail market for ultrabroadband services by means of commercial policies designed to restrict the 
space of customer contendibility remaining for the competitor operators.
After the start of the proceedings, the Authority's officials carried out an inspection at some of TIM’s offices in 
the month of July 2017. On November 2, 2017, TIM filed a defense brief in which, in support of the correctness 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 26of its actions, it challenged all the arguments that the conduct it had allegedly engaged in, and which was the 
subject of the case, was unlawful.
On February 14, 2018, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) resolved to extend the scope of the case to 
investigate further behavior concerning TIM's wholesale pricing strategy on the market for wholesale access to 
broadband and ultrabroadband, and the use of the inside information of customers of the alternative 
operators.
On July 5, 2018 TIM filed proposed undertakings which, if accepted by the Authority, would close the 
investigation without any offense being established or sanction being administered. The undertakings were 
considered as admissible by the Authority, that market tested them in August and September.
On October 30, 2018, TIM replied to observations made by third parties and modified its proposed 
undertakings. With its decision notified on December 4, 2018, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) once 
and for all rejected the proposed series of undertakings as it considered them unsuitable in light of the 
objections raised.
On March 4, 2019, TIM requested AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) for an extension of the deadline for 
closing the proceedings (initially set for May 31, 2019).
On April 10, 2019, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) resolved to extend the deadline for conclusion of 
the proceedings until September 30, 2019. On May 17, 2019, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) notified 
TIM of the results of the investigation (CRI). In the CRI, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) essentially 
confirmed the case for the prosecution outlined in the start-up and extension of the proceedings orders.  
On June 12, 2019 AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) extended the deadline for deposit of TIM's final 
defense to September 20, 2019 and set the final hearing for September 25, 2019.
On September 18, 2019, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) resolved to extend the deadline for 
conclusion of the proceedings until February 28, 2020.
On March 6, 2020, TIM was notified of the decision to close the investigation: AGCM (the Italian Competition 
Authority) ruled that TIM had abused its dominant position, finding that TIM had put in place an anti-
competitive strategy designed to hinder the competitive development of investment in Ultrabroadband 
network infrastructure. 
The fine imposed on TIM for the anti-competitive offense is 116,099,937.60 euros. TIM appealed the 
aforementioned fine before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court (TAR). By judgment given on 02.28.2022, 
the Lazio Regional Administrative Court rejected TIM’s petition; TIM now intends to lodge an appeal with the 
Council of State by the legal deadline.
On June 25, 2020 TIM sent AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) the so-called compliance report as 
ordered in the final provision. The hearing before the Lazio Regional Administrative Court was held on 
November 3, 2021. The Company is awaiting the judgment.
In May 2021, the Company paid the fine.
Open Fiber
In March 2020, Open Fiber (OF) sued TIM before the Court of Milan, claiming damages of 1.5 billion euros for 
alleged abuse of an exclusive and dominant position in relation to OF. The alleged actions consist of: (i) pre-
emptive investments in FTTC networks in white areas; (ii) initiating specious legal action to obstruct Infratel 
tenders; (iii) spurious repricing of certain wholesale services; (iv) commercial lock-in offers on the retail market; 
(v) false disclosure to AGCom in connection with the approval of a wholesale offer and spreading rumors about 
TIM being interested in acquiring OF; (vi) discriminatory access conditions to TIM passive infrastructure. TIM 
filed an appearance, contesting the arguments of OF. Enel S.p.A. intervened in the proceedings, asking that 
TIM be ordered to compensate all damages suffered and being suffered by Enel and OF. During the course of 
the proceedings, this amount was increased to 2.6 billion euros. 
Vodafone
In January 2021, Vodafone Italia S.p.A. summonsed TIM to the Court of Milan, making a claim for damages of 
approximately 100 million euros for damages allegedly suffered as a consequence of the unlawful conduct of 
TIM, as sanctioned by the AGCM, with the provision that concluded case A514.
The conduct of TIM sanctioned by the Authority allegedly resulted in a slowing of the penetration of UBB 
infrastructures on the market of white areas and, consequently, the delayed or failed acquisition of new 
customers by Vodafone, as well as a hindrance to acquiring additional customers as a result of the alleged 
binding practices over the whole of national territory. TIM will file an appearance with a series of solid legal 
arguments for its own protection. The case was settled as part of a global settlement with Vodafone.
Fastweb
In February 2021, Fastweb S.p.A. summonsed TIM to the Court of Milan, making a claim for damages of 
approximately 996 million euros for damages allegedly suffered as a consequence of the unlawful conduct of 
TIM, as sanctioned by AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority), with the provision that concluded case A514, 
as well as allegedly opportunistic suspensions of activation orders sent by Fastweb.
Fastweb complains that TIM allegedly delayed the wholesale offer of ultrabroadband services by Open Fiber in 
the white areas, consequently slowing the offer of said services by Fastweb to its end customers in these 
areas; binding practices were implemented in relations with the end customer, hindering access to the market 
by alternative operators (including Fastweb). In addition, TIM allegedly instrumentally managed the supply 
process of wholesale access services to its fixed broadband and ultrabroadband network, opportunistically 
suspending the activation orders submitted by Fastweb and thereby hindering its activation of new customers. 
TIM filed an appearance laying out solid arguments refuting Fastweb’s claims. In August 2021, the case was 
settled as part of a settlement with Fastweb.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 27Italian Competition Authority Case I799
At its meeting on February 1, 2017, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) initiated an investigation for 
possible breach of Article 101 of the TFEU (prohibition of agreements that restrict competition) against TIM 
S.p.A. and Fastweb S.p.A., following the signing of an agreement aimed at setting up a cooperative joint 
venture called Flash Fiber S.r.l.. TIM, in agreement with Fastweb, submitted to AGCM some amendments to the 
agreements signed, in the form of proposed undertakings, aimed at closing the investigation without any 
breach being ascertained and, therefore, without any fine.
On March 28, 2018, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) resolved to approve the undertakings, making 
them binding on the Parties, and closed the case without imposing any fine.
On January 30, 2019, TIM sent the planned annual report on the provided coverage to AGCM (the Italian 
Competition Authority), supplemented by a subsequent communication dated March 29, 2019. TIM 
transmitted further details to AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) in July and AGCM acknowledged it on 
October 15, 2019. On January 31, 2020 TIM sent AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) the third report on 
the implementation of the undertakings given. Finally, on January 29, 2021 TIM sent AGCM (the Italian 
Competition Authority) the fourth and final report on the implementation of the undertakings given.
On June 11, 2018 Open Fiber S.p.A. and Wind Tre S.p.A. filed separate appeals to the Lazio Regional 
Administrative Court (TAR) against the order closing case I799 with the acceptance of the undertakings. They 
allege that this order has a series of procedural and substantial defects.
Open Fiber S.p.A. also asked for the precautionary suspension of the order.
In a judgment of March 2020, the Regional Administrative Court rejected in full the appeal by Open Fiber. A 
hearing on the merits has not yet been scheduled for Wind Tre's appeal.

“Disputes and pending legal actions, other information, commitments and guarantees" in the Annual Financial 
Report available at the following link: TIM Group financial reports .
Eutelia and Voiceplus 
In June 2009, Eutelia and Voiceplus asked that alleged acts of abuse by TIM of its dominant position in the 
premium services market (based on the public offer of services provided through so-called Non Geographic 
Numbers) be investigated. The plaintiffs quantified their damages at a total of approximately 730 million euros.
The case follows a precautionary procedure in which the Milan Appeal Court prohibited certain behaviors of the 
Company relating to the management of some financial relations with Eutelia and Voiceplus concerning the 
Non Geographic Numbers, for which TIM managed the payments from the end users, on behalf of such OLOs 
and in the light of regulatory requirements. After the judgment with which the Milan Court of Appeal accepted 
TIM's objections, declaring that it was not competent in this matter and referring the case to the Civil Court, 
Eutelia in extraordinary administration and Voiceplus in liquidation resubmitted the matter to the Milan Court. 
The first hearing took place in the month of March 2014. TIM filed an appearance challenging the claims of the 
other parties. After the collapse of Voiceplus, the Milan Court declared the case suspended, in an order in 
September 2015. The case was later resumed by Voiceplus.
With a judgment issued in February 2018, the Milan Court accepted TIM's defense and rejected the plaintiffs’ 
claim for compensation, ordering them, jointly and severally, to pay the legal costs. In March 2018 Eutalia and 
Voiceplus proposed an appeal against the judgment at first instance.
TIM appealed against the claim, requesting confirmation in full of the judgment at first instance. The appeal of 
Eutelia and Voiceplus was fully rejected with the judgment of August 5, 2019.  In December 2019 Eutelia and 
Voiceplus appealed to the Court of Cassation over the judgment of the Court of Appeal. TIM notified a 
counterclaim asking confirmation of the judgment appealed against.
28 day billing
With resolution 121/17/CONS AGCom introduced instructions on billing intervals for telephony, prescribing, for 
fixed telephony, that the interval should be monthly, or multiples thereof, and, for mobile telephony, that it 
should be at least four-weekly. TIM appealed Resolution 121/17/CONS to the Regional Administrative Court. The 
judgment rejecting the appeal was published in February 2018. TIM appealed this judgment to the Council of 
State in June 2018. On September 23, 2020, the non-definitive judgment was published whereby the Council of 
State joined the appeals submitted by TIM, Vodafone, Fastweb and Wind Tre and ordered the prejudicial 
deferral to the European Union Court of Justice (EUCJ) on whether or not the Authority had the power to 
regulate the frequency of renewal of the commercial offers and invoicing periods, at the same time rejecting 
the other grounds of appeal submitted by the operators and suspending proceedings. In February 2021, TIM 
deposited the written observations on the requests for prejudicial judgment with the EUCJ. At the request of 
the CJEU, the Council of State, in an order published on November 23, 2021, confirmed the referral to the Court 
of Justice on the preliminary questions raised; the proceedings before the Council of State therefore remain 
suspended pending the CJEU's decision.
With its Resolution 499/17/CONS, having confirmed the breach of Resolution 121/17/CONS, AGCom fined TIM 
1,160,000 euros, ordering it to make provision – when the billing cycle was restored to monthly intervals or 
multiples thereof – to return the amounts corresponding to the fee for the number of days that, from June 23, 
2017, had not been used by the users in terms of the supply of service due to the misalignment of the four-
weekly and monthly billing cycles. 
In March 2018 with resolution no. 112/18/CONS AGCom (i) revoked the preceding resolution 499/17/CONS in the 
part in which TIM was ordered to repay the amounts presumably lost from June 23, 2017 onwards, with the 
four-weekly billing cycle, (ii) cautioned TIM, with regard to fixed-line voice services only, against postponing the 
starting date of invoices issued after the return to monthly invoicing by the same number of days as those 
presumably deducted starting from June 23, 2017 with the four-weekly invoicing cycle. 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 28Under Presidential Decree 9/18/PRES, AGCom amended the provisions of Decision 112/18/CONS requiring the 
deferral of billing once the billing cycle was restored to monthly intervals, or multiples thereof, while also 
ordering that the timescales for complying with the order would be identified after hearings with the operators 
and the main consumer protection associations. 
In July 2018, AGCom issued resolution 269/18/CONS, with which it set December 31, 2018 as the date by which 
the operators had to return to their fixed network customers a number of days of service equal to those eroded 
as an effect of 28-day billing, or propose to the affected customers any alternative compensatory measures, 
after having notified them to AGCom. TIM has appealed all of the above resolutions.
With the judgment published in November 2018, the Regional Administrative Court canceled the pecuniary 
administrative fines of 1.16 million euros imposed with Resolution 499/17/CONS, and confirmed the obligation 
of restitutio in integrum to the fixed-line customers by December 31, 2018. TIM filed its preventive appeal 
before the Council of State to suspend the execution of said decision and, with its ruling of December 20, 2018, 
the Council of State, in upholding TIM's appeal, suspended the effectiveness of the aforesaid decision for the 
reversal order only, until May 21, 2019 while awaiting publication of the grounds for the judgment.
The date of the hearing to discuss the introductory appeal and additional grounds submitted in the meantime 
by TIM is still to be set. On July 12, 2019 the ruling mechanisms with which the Council of State rejected the 
similar appeals made by Vodafone, Wind Tre and Fastweb were published and in February 2020 the 
judgments containing the grounds were published.
In September 2019, TIM also challenged resolution 221/19/CONS, before the Regional Administrative Court 
(TAR), with which the sanction pursuant to Resolution 499/17/CONS, canceled by the Regional Administrative 
Court of Lazio, was recalculated to the amount of 580,000.00 euros, with the maximum fine provided for by 
Art. 98, paragraph 16 of the CCE in force at the time of the events applied.
In August 2019, AGCom initiated new proceedings (CONT 12/19/DTC) for failure to comply with the order to 
refund the days eroded by billing every 28 days for fixed network and convergent customers, according to the 
procedures established with resolutions nos. 112/18/CONS and 269/18/CONS. On conclusion of these 
proceedings, by means of Resolution 75/20/CONS, the Authority found that TIM did not comply with the above 
resolutions, imposing a fine of 3 million euros. The measure was challenged by TIM before the Regional 
Administrative Court in July 2020.
Moreover, since June 2019, TIM has offered its fixed network customers, active prior to March 31, 2018 and 
subject to billing every 28 days, the possibility of accepting a compensatory solution, an alternative to 
refunding the eroded days pursuant to AGCom resolution no. 269/18/CONS and from September 2019 it has 
been accepting requests for reimbursement of eroded days. In both cases, TIM informed customers with 
several messages in the bill, on the web in the main newspapers. The initiatives just described were 
communicated to AGCom as part of the aforementioned penalty proceedings.
In the civil proceedings, by judgment published on October 14, 2021 the Court of Milan, under the scope of the 
case on the merits brought by Associazione Movimento dei Consumatori in 2018 regarding the pricing and 28-
day renewal for fixed line and converging offers, confirmed the order given on 6/4/2018 by the same Court 
upon closure of the complaint brought by TIM pursuant to Art. 669 terdecies of the Italian Code of Civil 
Procedure and the measures set out therein, ordering TIM to fulfill the requests for repayment of amounts paid 
as a result of customer maneuvers - including discontinued, as indeed TIM had already been doing since 2018, 
at the same time also extending the period relevant to the recognition of the reimbursement through to April 
1, 2017 and therefore earlier than June 23, 2017, the date on which the operators had to comply with 
Resolution no. 121/17/CONS. TIM has appealed the judgment of the Court of Milan, at the same time filing an 
request for suspension of its enforcement. With ordinance of January 11, 2022, the Court of Appeal of Milan 
partially accepted TIM’s request, suspending the charge in the judgment relating to the order to send a 
registered letter to all terminated consumer customers that were subject to billing every 28 days to inform 
them of the possibility that they could obtain a refund of the additional amounts paid as a result of the 
maneuver.
Italian Competition Authority Case I820
On February 19, 2018, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) initiated a I820 preliminary proceeding against 
the companies TIM, Vodafone, Fastweb, Wind Tre and the industry association ASSTEL to investigate the 
alleged existence of an agreement among the major fixed-line and mobile telephone operators to restrict 
competition by coordinating their respective commercial strategies, in breach of Art. 101 of the TFUE.
The presumed coordination, according to the opening provision of the proceedings by AGCM (the Italian 
Competition Authority), would take the form of implementation of the obligation introduced by Article 19-
quinquiesdecies of Legislative Decree 148/2017 (converted by Law 172/2017) which requires operators of 
electronic communication services to send out monthly (or monthly multiples) bills and renewed offers for 
fixed and mobile services.
On March 21, 2018, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) issued a provisional precautionary measure 
against all the operators involved in the proceedings with which it ordered the suspension, pending the 
proceedings, of the implementation of the agreement concerning the determination of repricing 
communicated to users at the time of reformulating the billing cycle in compliance with Law 172/17 and to 
independently redetermine its commercial strategy. With its decision no. 27112 of April 11, 2018, AGCM (the 
Italian Competition Authority) confirmed the precautionary measure.
On June 12, 2018, TIM filed an appeal with the Regional Administrative Court for the quashing of said measure.
On January 31, 2020, TIM was notified of the decision to close the investigation, in which AGCM (the Italian 
Competition Authority) confirmed the existence of the agreement between Telecom, Vodafone, Fastweb, 
WindTre, but excluding Asstel from participation in the agreement. The fine imposed on TIM for participation in 
the anti-competitive agreement was 114,398,325 euros. In April 2020, TIM also challenged the sanction order.
In a judgment published on July 12, 2021, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court upheld the petition and the 
grounds added and submitted by TIM, canceling the measures taken by AGCM (the Italian Competition 
Authority), including that relating to the existence of the agreement and application of the sanction.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 29On September 11, 2021, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) presented a petition to the Council of State, 
requesting the cancellation of the judgment given by the regional administrative court.
Italian Competition Authority Case I857
On July 6, 2021, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) started an investigation in regard to TIM and DAZN 
for a possible understanding reached with a view to restricting competition in connection with the agreement 
for the distribution and technological support for TV rights for Serie A football in the 2021-2024 period.
The investigation also aims to verify the restrictive nature of the understanding with reference to additional 
elements regarding the possible adoption by TIM of technical solutions not available for competitor 
telecommunications operators and which may effectively hinder the adoption of their own technological 
solutions.
The proceedings are expected to end by June 30, 2022.
At the same time, the Authority has also initiated proceedings for the potential adoption of protective 
measures. 
By resolution passed on July 27, 2021, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) closed the interim proceedings, 
considering that the initiatives and amendments to the agreement proposed by TIM and DAZN in the 
meantime are presently able to prevent any serious and irreparable damage to competitors while 
investigations are completed. 
Indeed, said measures aim, as a whole, to avoid possible discrimination in the use of the DAZN service, due to 
its activation by users using Internet connection services other than those offered by TIM. In addition, the 
agreement between TIM and DAZN has been amended to guarantee DAZN complete freedom in applying 
discounts and promotions. TIM has also undertaken to provide DAZN with a sufficient number of white label 
set-top-boxes to also guarantee DAZN customers the viewing of matches over digital terrestrial TV, in the 
event of connection problems. 
Finally, TIM has undertaken to supply wholesale services to OAOs interested therein to manage traffic peaks 
deriving from live data transmissions, regardless of the type of contents transmitted.
On October 29, 2021 TIM submitted a proposal for undertakings to AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) 
with a view to resolving the competitive concerns that were the subject of the investigation and closing the 
proceedings without the finding of any infringement and therefore without any sanction being applied.
On December 14, 2021, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) approved the publication of the 
aforementioned proposal for undertakings on the Authority's website, as these undertakings, taken as a whole, 
do not appear to be manifestly unfounded and are capable of removing the restrictions to competition 
hypothesized in the measure initiating the investigation in question.
On January 5, 2022, with the aforementioned publication on the AGCM website, the so-called market test 
began, which will end on February 4 next, the date by which all interested parties will be able to send the 
Authority their comments on the undertakings in question.
Italian Competition Authority Case PS10888 “TIM Passepartout”
On June 15, 2021, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) initiated proceedings for unfair commercial 
practice concerning the lack of transparency of the information provided by the TIM Passepartout payment 
management platform and alleged activations of services not requested. The proceedings have been initiated 
on the basis of reports made by individual consumers and should draw to a close in March 2022. On July 29, 
2021, commitments were submitted that, if accepted, will allow the proceedings to close without any findings 
of infringement and, therefore, without any application of sanctions. The undertakings consist of improving 
information aspects of the TIM Passepartout platform (active only for Customer Base offers) and implementing 
a communication campaign aimed at soliciting contact from those who do not recognize the TIM Passepartout 
charges in order to assess whether there are grounds for a refund.
Iliad
By writ of summons served during the first quarter of 2020, Iliad Italia S.p.A. sued TIM before the Court of Milan 
for alleged anti-competitive conduct, including through the Kena Mobile brand, which was allegedly aimed at 
hindering its entry to and consolidation in the mobile phone market in Italy, seeking damages of at least 71.4 
million euros.
TIM filed an appearance, fully disputing the requests of Iliad Italia S.p.A.; and, in turn, submitting a 
counterclaim in accordance with Art. 2598 of the Italian Civil Code, with reference to the denigration 
implemented by Iliad Italia S.p.A. in regard to TIM and formulating a symmetrical claim for compensation for 
damages. In the first preliminary brief, Iliad updated its claim for damages, taking it to 242.8 million euros. 
Upon lifting the reservation on the preliminary motions, the Court adjourned the hearing to May 4, 2022 for the 
closing arguments.
Iliad
By writ of summons notified in September 2021, Iliad Italia S.p.A. summonsed TIM before the Court of Milan for 
the alleged application to customers of unlawful contractual conditions in terms of time limits and economic 
costs for withdrawal with reference to mobile and fixed telephone offers, with a consequent petition to order 
TIM to compensate damages, currently quantified as 120.4 million euros. On February 1, 2022, the first hearing 
was held and the terms assigned for the briefs pursuant to article 183, subsection VI of the Italian Code of Civil 
Procedure.

attributed to ESG indicators by institutions and society in general. As the Group companies are fully integrated 
with the areas where they operate and with the social, economic and production fabric of such areas, they aim 
to contribute to the economic well-being and growth of the communities by providing increasingly digitalized 
services, increasingly focused on favoring sustainable lifestyles.
As private entities requiring cost-effective management, Group companies take the social impact of 
telecommunications services into account in their decision-making activities, responding to the needs of

Sustainable instruments available to the community: fund raising through solidarity 
numbers
In a national and international context in which crisis and conflict scenarios are multiplying, against an ever-
increasing number of people in need and emergency situations, private solidarity fundraising  is a key factor 
in “person-to-person” cohesion and support.
For over 18 years, TIM has been a key player in the solidarity chain, supporting humanitarian, scientific and 
environmental protection projects by allowing people to make a donation of 1 or 2 euros with a text message, 
or 2, 5 or 10 euros with a call to a dedicated number from a landline.
The amounts collected are fully paid by TIM to the promoters (non-profit organizations, non-government 
organizations and volunteer associations), in accordance with requirements of transparency and sustainability, 
without any withholdings or application of tax rates.
The new Self-Regulatory Code issued by AGCOM - Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni (Italian 
Communications Authority) in 2017 ordered the creation of 60 numbers dedicated to solidarity fundraising (30 
permanent numbers lasting one year and 30 temporary numbers lasting a maximum of 21 days), regulated 
with a special price list.
Two free numbers are dedicated to emergencies or natural disasters, on request by the Civil Protection 
Department.
120 solidarity campaigns were launched in 2021, which raised approximately 9.2 million euros. The largest 
amount of funds were raised for scientific research projects, followed by healthcare and social assistance in 
Italy.
The commitment of Fondazione TIM 
The TIM Group has always stood out for its sensitivity and attention to the needs of our society, including 
through the work of its foundation.
Fondazione TIM (FTIM) promotes and disseminates the culture of innovation by means of initiatives and 
projects that facilitate social inclusion, research and education and the protection of the historic and artistic 
heritage. The foundation is able to operate, in Italy and abroad, with methods and strategies that are in line 
with the company’s purposes and values as set out in the bylaws.
FTIM pursues its mission with tenders or the direct allocation of donations. In accordance with its Regulations, 
it can fund private and public non-profit bodies or religious bodies.
The projects supported by FTIM must be able to stand out for their innovative and experimental nature, the 
use of information and communications technologies and the speed at which the project is finalized in the face 
of sudden events. The projects must belong to the foundation’s three priority areas of intervention:
■‘Social inclusion’, with educational and support initiatives dedicated to vulnerable or otherwise 
disadvantaged people; 
■‘Education and research’, the latter in the fields of medical and natural sciences, economics and law;
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 311 [GRI 206-1]  The potential negative impacts arising exclusively from excavations for installing cable ducts or positioning base transceiver stations 
are mitigated through the use of low environmental impact technologies, such as mini trenches, and thanks to prior agreements with local 
communities, e.g. regarding aerial installation sites.■‘Art’, to protect and enhance the historic and artistic heritage, by developing ways and means of using and 
disseminating knowledge about the heritage, and to support the world of entertainment and music.
In 2021 FTIM dedicated resources amounting to around 2,000,000 euros to 9 tenders classified in 3 areas, 
confirming that the objectives of each tender include the attention to the correlation with the effects of the 
pandemic in the recovery phase.
For Social Inclusion:
1.Conoscersi e riconoscersi  (Knowing and Recognizing Each Other)
The purpose of this tender was to highlight, within the Group, ideas and positive experiences, through the 
presentation by colleagues of projects in partnership with non-profit entities, to increase the awareness 
that the personal commitment of everyone can concretely improve our society as a whole. 
The elderly have been harshly impacted with the feeling of loneliness caused by the measures to limit 
contagion of the pandemic. FTIM decided to do something to support this section of society, dedicating a 
tender with a value of 200,000 euros. The objective of this tender was to identify a simple but organized 
technological model to overcome the loneliness of the elderly and built a network of acquaintances so that 
they are no longer alone.
The awardees of the tenders were: the Atlas Onlus association, which presented its project Senti chi 
Parla  (Look Who’s Talking)  - an app addressing the needs surveyed among the elderly, which enables 
them to communicate, build relationships and share experiences and knowledge - and the TICE Social 
Cooperative, which presented the DEL + DEL  project, which aims to grant the elderly in Italy dignity and 
social utility and create a new narrative regarding them. For each project, the amount of the grant 
amounted to 100,000 euros.
2.A tavola insieme  (Let’s Eat Together)
The pandemic changes Italians’ lifestyles and consumption habits, accentuating pre-existing difficulties 
that drove players in the voluntary sector to study new, more efficient and sustainable solutions to meet 
the emerging social, local and education needs. FTIM turned to entities in the voluntary sector to propose 
the tender “ A tavola insieme ,” with a value of 300,000 euros, which identified innovative solutions to assist 
persons who, in this scenario, had and have problems affording a daily meal. Many of these associations 
found different ways to do this, also due to the limits imposed as a result of the pandemic. The tender “A 
tavola insieme” provided support to the people that have made and continue to make this effort. 
Specifically, the tender aimed to develop solutions based on innovative, accessible, effective and efficient 
technologies in order to favor social inclusion, starting with the right to food. The objective was to identify a 
replicable model for recovery surplus food, collecting and distributing it to the poor. The entity selected by 
FTIM was  which was assigned a grant amounting to 274,183 euros for the project Comunità Emmanuel 
Onlus,  #Nonsolopane  (Not Just Bread).  The project aims to organize the immediate distribution of food 
packages by creating software that optimizes internal management and facilitates dialog between the 
Food bank service, the Municipalities in the Province of Lecce, large-scale retail trade and people in need, 
who can use those services, after receiving a specific card. 
3.Mai più soli  (No Longer Alone)
Through the “ Mai più soli ” tender, FTIM aimed to develop a project to identify innovative solutions, using 
technological support, to assist the elderly, the disabled and, in general, the most vulnerable in their day-
to-day activities, and enable them to live a fully autonomous life in their environment. The goal of the 
tender was to identify projects that could create areas of autonomous living for all people who are not self-
sufficient due to a physical or cognitive disability. The Associazione Italiana Rett Onlus  (AIRETT) , which 
was awarded the tender for an amount of 135,000 euros, presented the Libere di muoversi  (Free to Move) 
project, which aims to develop a smart walker capable of helping girls with Rett syndrome to walk 
autonomously again, improving their lives and supporting their caretakers.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 32For Education and Scientific Research: 
1. Scholarships - “ Studiamoci su ” (Let’s Study It)
In such an uncontrollable and inscrutable context, caused by the pandemic, science, research and 
medicine have never been a more strategic asset for humanity. While in the first year and a half of the 
emergency, it was crucial to dedicate efforts to expanding the task force of experts operating in the fields 
of medicine and research to stem the overwhelming spread of the virus, it is now fundamental to focus 
attention and resources on a long-term strategy. The COVID-19 emergency shone a spotlight on the 
decisive role of technology in science and medicine: artificial intelligence and data technology enable the 
analysis of complex phenomenon and the identification of solutions, with connected assessment of risks 
and benefits, spreading at the same pace as the virus. Scientific research and technology are a crucial 
resource for overcoming the global crisis and preparing the world for increasingly complex challenges. For 
this reason, investing in science and innovation are the focal point for all areas of the economy and the 
main objective of corporate social commitment.
From this perspective, FTIM decided to launch the tender Scholarships – “ Studiamoci su ,” targeted to 
colleges, university clinics and research entities, to finance 2 annual scholarships for biotech and medical 
research projects on the impacts of the Coronavirus on people and society.
The awardees of the two grants with a value of 50,000 euros each were:
■Federico II University – Department of Translational Medical Science – Pediatrics Section , for the e-
PediatricChronic Care (ePCC) project , an app dedicated to families and child patients suffering from 
chronic illnesses, who require long-term, stable hospital care. The project’s goal is to improve the 
participation in treatments and ensure - in times of COVID-19 - continuous care, also outside medical 
facilities.
■Fondazione Alfieri per il Cuore, for the FOUR-T TRIAL – Medicine 4.0 project , a clinical study 
targeting cardiopathic patients who have undergone operations, who have tricuspid valve heart 
disease and heart failure, who are “randomly” assigned post-surgery support through either the 
current standard (H - GPs) or an innovative process through local clinics, supported by telemedicine, 
with impact assessment also in terms of healthcare costs.
2.Insegnami ad insegnare  (Teach Me to Teach)
Experimental, innovative projects (tutorials, webinars, …) for training regarding remote learning targeted to 
teachers in schools of all levels. The pandemic and resulting lockdown exposed the inability of many 
teachers not only to use technology, but also, and especially, their inability to teach remotely, engaging 
students and holding their attention, managing to understand the learning difficulties or individual 
problems of each student, aspects which are crucial to a teacher’s ability in in-class learning. It was 
important to focus on relationship aspects and on how technology can assist in improving learning and 
developing specific aptitudes. This tender was targeted to schools of all levels, associations and research 
institutes that provide refresher courses for teachers.
The two projects selected were:
■Fondazione Giovanni e Irene Cova for the Digital pills for teach [ sic] project, with a grant assigned of 
72,240 euros. The project sets out a call to action for teachers, to engage a group of 120 teachers on an 
interactive web platform that will enable them to undertake a training course shared with colleagues 
through the entire country.
■ALPIM/Associazione Ligure per i Minori (Ligurian Association for Minors) for the project InOutPut  - Il 
digitale per una nuova alleanza educativa (Digital Services for a New Education Alliance), with a grant 
assigned of 74,700 euros. The project aims to increase the skills of elementary school teachers for 
teaching in a digital environment, to favor the active participation of students through the ‘we school’ 
platform.
3.Compagni di scuola  (Classmates)
Through the tender “ Compagni di scuola ,” FTIM decided to dedicate resources to creating and developing 
innovating instruments to share the new methods of attending school, which, unfortunately, have been 
caused by the effects of the pandemic. The tender aimed to support projects presented by teachers and 
students of middle schools and high schools, focused on reinventing - remotely - all that the experience of 
school offers in addition to actual lessons (recess, teacher conferences after lessons, waiting for lessons to 
start, etc.). 
Don Pietro Margini Cooperativa Sociale in Sant'Ilario d'Enza di Reggio Emilia  received a grant of 150,000 
euros for the STUDEO project , a new instrument on a web app and mobile app, called STUDEO, based on 
asynchronous functionality, which is useful both to in-class teaching and remote teaching. The main 
purpose of the app is to revolutionize the handling of homework, to teach a studying method and, above 
all, favor dialog between classmates, and between students and teachers, which has been lost during the 
pandemic.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 33For Art and Culture:
1.Che lo spettacolo abbia, di nuovo, inizio!  (Let the Show Begin Again!)
Through the tender " Che lo spettacolo abbia, di nuovo, inizio !", FTIM aimed to stimulate types of shows that 
could once again bring applause and sharing experiences to the forefront, where safety measures could be 
an additional element of emotional support, rather than a barrier, where digital streaming could be a 
means to reach all fans and expand audiences.
The tragic experience of the pandemic created a process to be developed: streaming. The numerous 
events broadcast through streaming during 2020 resulted in the gradual adoption by theaters and cultural 
organizations of innovative, usable formulas for participation. Moreover, commitment and creativity, 
strength and passion kept artists going, as they developed extremely creative and generous shows. 
However, it is undoubted that streamed performances strongly missed the audience in the theater.
FTIM posed the question of show business in the post-lockdown period, and thus decided to promote 
projects that combine the two types of enjoyment, digital and physical attendance. The objective of this 
tender is to capture the significant potential participation that technology permits and reopen the 
traditional forms of attendance that were missed during this period of suspension, inventing a new, 
innovative formula for going to the theater, a concert or the movies.
The awardees of the grant of 125,000 euros each were:
■Fondazione La Società dei Concerti of Milan , for the Swipe Your Stage! project , which brings a new 
format for enjoying live classical music to the Milanese music scene. 10 concerts in the Milan area, both 
in the city and suburbs, in which viewers can experience excellent music due to the software developed 
by Diagon s.r.l., 400 tablets and 6 professional video cameras installed in the concert halls. 
■Fucina Culturale Machiavelli for the VIRTUAL LIVE project . The goal of this initiative is to bring live 
plays to the largest possible audience, using virtual reality and live broadcasting, which can be viewed 
anywhere in the world, on any device. This involves an actual movie in real time: a single, long 
sequence shot, which the viewer enjoys live, in which the actors act following a plot that includes 
several decisions and possible split offs. The spectator is the one to choose which action to take. 
2.Facciamola facile  (Let’s Make It Easy)
Through the tender “ Facciamola facile ,” FTIM aimed to identify new ways of “reconnecting” with cultural 
events through technology, but also through personal services, starting with the fundamental concept of 
the equality of every human being, which does not divide the audience into categories, but makes culture, 
content and places equally usable and accessible to everyone.
The objective of the tender was to stimulate the creation of projects that make it simpler to experience 
cultural activities in museums, theaters and auditoriums for all people, with the support of technology, but 
also through personal services. The tender aimed to provide significant opportunities to projects whose use 
of technologies such as artificial intelligence solutions, apps, augmented reality, web-based solutions, 
computer programs and virtual viewing platforms were their empowering strengths.
Polytechnic University of Turin – Automation and IT Department, for the Reading (&) Machine  Project, 
was awarded a grant with a value of 100,000 euros. The project moves along two lines that are parallel to 
each other, but highly interconnected. On one hand, it works on designing and implementing a system of 
recommendation, with the assistance of artificial intelligence technologies, to represent, expand and 
enrich the experience of reading. On the other hand, it assists readers using a system of discovery and 
navigation, enabling them to move through a virtual library, where each user can explore the books 
ordered based on his/her interests, and interact with authors, publishers, critics and other users. This 
assistance can be used from home, via the internet, as well as at libraries and bookstores, due to physical 
installations.
3.… di nuovo musica, Maestro! (Play It Again!)
Through the tender “… di nuovo musica, Maestro !,” FTIM focused resources and attention to music, to give 
life to ideas and initiatives dedicated to new ways of enjoying live music. Music has always been an 
instrument of emancipation, inclusion and integration, a form of expression that frees up new energies and 
breaks down social barriers, an area for which FTIM has always demonstrated sensitivity and commitment.
This tender specifically proposed the creation and development of projects to identify innovative solutions, 
using the support of technology, to assist those who currently have difficulty affording costs, specifically 
due to the economic effects of the pandemic in this artistic area.
The awardees were:
■Officine Buone OdV of  Pioltello, Milan, with “Open Stage - Da Sanremo all’Eurovision” (Open Stage - 
From Sanremo to Eurovision) , an innovative project that makes emerging artists protagonists in their 
towns, using technology and a traveling contest that stops in Sanremo, Milan and Turin, site of the 
Eurovision Contest 2022, for an amount of 125,000 euros. This initiative will develop an innovative 
urban entertainment platform with numerous functions that can be activated using IoT and 5G 
technology.
■Jonathan Livingston Association of Palermo, with the “TIM Ecoturism-Music Live” project, for an 
amount of 123,115  euros. This is an app which provides users with the option to take virtual tours of 
natural reserves managed by the G.R.E. and receive information on all musical events and live tours 
that are developed in the sites involved in the project.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 34In 2021 FTIM decided to develop highly sensitive initiatives in line with the objectives of the Fondazione based 
on its mission, through 4 donations to entities that have distinguished themselves due to the worthy projects 
presented:
1. Sanità di Frontiera Onlus
Given the positive evolution of the “Polo psichiatrico-psicologico per giovani a rischio dipendenze” (Psychiatric-
Psychological Hub for Youth at Risk of Addiction) project, which was previously supported in its start-up phase 
in 2020, FTIM decided to contribute also in 2021, with an amount of 50,000 euros. Based on the results 
obtained, the steady increase in users reached and the emerging needs expressed by the scenario in which it 
operates, it was deemed essential to be able to guarantee uninterrupted work in the local areas for another 12 
months. The project entails the creation of “low threshold” Psychiatric-Psychological Hubs in the San Lorenzo, 
Tor Marancia and Pietralata districts of Rome, to support and work in line with the services already present in 
the local areas to prevent and combat psychological-social difficulties among the most vulnerable young 
people, both foreign and Italian (children and young adults) at risk of addiction to psychoactive drugs and 
alcohol, difficulties which are currently exacerbated by the coronavirus emergency. 
2. Fondazione Campagna Amica  
A grant of 50,000 euros for a Solidarity Campaign to distribute packages of 100% Italian food to families in 
need for Easter 2021. This solidarity initiative, sponsored by the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, included 
agricultural and agrifood companies, the management and national and local structures of Coldiretti (Italian 
Agricultural Trade Association) and the Campagna Amica markets for direct sale of agricultural products.
3. European Brain Research Institute (EBRI) Rita Levi Montalcini
FTIM awarded a donation in the amount of 60,000 euros to the “Sostegno alle Ricercatrici Afghane ” (Support 
to Afghan Women Researchers) project . The project intends to provide scientific information, cultural growth 
and a better future to Afghan women who have taken on a scientific career in biomedical research and saw 
the possibility of pursuing studies and work in their country suddenly vanish. Specifically, the project aims to 
award 2 scholarships to Afghan women researchers who have educational and post-gradual training levels 
that could integrate into research projects in the field of neuroscience carried out by the EBRI.  
The EBRI will welcome the two scholarship winners in its labs, offering them all the necessary support and 
supervision within the research team they will be assigned to. The grant from FTIM will make it possible to 
execute part of the project, covering one of the research scholarships and the related room and board of one 
Afghan woman researcher, for 2 years.
4. With Giacomo against Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome-APS 
With a grant of 10,000 euros, FTIM decided to support this association that carries out the social promotion of 
scientific research on diagnosis and treatment of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a rare genetic disease that 
results in the irregular production of collagen, which puts veins, arteries and hollow organs at risk of 
hemorrhage. The goal of the association is to protect the rights of people affected with that disease, favor their 
social integration and improve the quality of life of patients and their families.
Mausoleum of Augustus
The Mausoleum of Augustus, the largest circular tomb in the ancient world, an emblem of the architectonic 
excellence of ancient Rome, reopened to the public on March 1, 2021. The Mausoleum was closed in 2007 due 
to the start of archaeological investigations in preparation of the extensive project of recovery and restoration 
carried out by Roma Capitale.  FTIM immediately joined the project for restoration and enhancement of the 
Mausoleum to give life back to one of the most visited sites in the world. FTIM believes that it is important that 
private patrons also work to conserve and promote Italy’s historical and cultural assets. 
Instituto TIM
On the Brazilian front, the social investment strategy implemented by TIM aims to promote the social inclusion 
of disadvantaged groups in Brazilian society, particularly children and teenagers, by running educational 
programs relating to Science, Technology and Innovation (STI).
Instituto TIM was founded in 2013, with the aim of defining strategies and providing resources for the 
dissemination of science, technology and innovation to support the development of community in Brazil. 
Four areas were identified as being important for Instituto TIM’s contribution to the development of Brazilian 
society:   
■education/teaching,
■applications,
■work,
■Social inclusion.

Instituto TIM's work has already reached all 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District, involving over 700,000 
people. 
Instituto TIM-OBMEP scholarships
The Instituto TIM-OBMEP Scholarships are dedicated to the winners of the Brazilian Public School Mathematics 
Olympics (OBMEP) who have started a degree in Astronomy, Biology, Computer Science, Economics, 
Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Mathematics, Medicine or Chemistry at a state university and come from low-
income families. The program is the result of a partnership between Instituto TIM and the Brazilian National 
Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA).
Since 2015, scholarships of around 1,000 reais have been paid every month for a maximum duration of 4 years. 
150 students receive these subsidies each year.
Academic Working Capital
Academic Working Capital (AWC) is a business education program supporting students wishing to transform 
their final degree project (Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso, TCC) into a technology-oriented company. The 
students attend bi-weekly workshops and monitoring sessions that help them to create an ecosystem in which 
the idea of “business” permeates the thoughts and actions of all participants. AWC offers financial support for 
the purchasing of consumables for the creation of authentic production engineering prototypes. At the end of 
the year, the groups present their products to investors and entrepreneurs. 
Since 2015 the program has involved 448 college students, with 161 projects supported and 58 start-ups 
launched.
Garatéa
The Garatéa-ISS initiative takes pupils’ scientific experiments into space and brings the study of space sciences 
into schools. As a result of those initiatives, from 2015 to 2020 over 250 college students received support and 
141 space-related science experiments were carried out by students throughout Brazil.
In 2020, due to Coronavirus and implementation of distance learning, the Garatéa project suspended its 
activities in schools. But, as always, on completion of the project, a Selection Board, along with specialized 
technicians working at NASA, chose the best scientific experiment. At the end of the year, the winning 
experiment for the 2019-2020 project, “The Influence of Microgravity on the Breakdown of Lactose and the 
Development of Bacteria in the Gut Flora”, developed by pupils in their second year of the Colégio Regina Coeli 
in Sorriso, Mato Grosso, was sent to the International Space Station (ISS). In 2021 Garatéa was concluded, 
terminating its cycle with this important award.
TIM Tec
TIM Tec is an MOOC2 platform and free software that offers free online courses in line with the Information and 
Communication Technology course that is part of the PRONATEC program3. Anyone can register to follow 
courses that teach, for example, programming languages, game, website and database design. There are also 
courses for primary school teachers and for honing skills considered fundamental for the training of all 
professionals, such as writing.
The technology and content of the TIM Tec platform are shared with the public training establishments with 
the support of the Department of Vocational and Technological Education of the Ministry of Education (Setec/
MEC). TIM Tec software was installed by 23 federal institutions and 2 state institutions and used as a remote 
training platform. 
Over the last two years, Instituto TIM has focused its efforts on making people’s lives easier during the 
pandemic. Registrations for the free online courses on the TIM Tec platform rose by 200% in the first half of 
2020, enabling more than 100,000 Brazilians to use the period of social isolation to improve their vocational 
skills with the 31 courses on offer. In 2021 a new course was launched, dedicated to topics relating to 
technology, agriculture and food.
Busca Ativa Escolar – Instituto TIM and UNICEF
There are 3.8 million children and teenagers out of school in Brazil. These children, aged from 4 to 17 years old, 
are denied the rights guaranteed under the constitution and the chance to acquire the skills they will need in 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 362 Massive Open Online Courses
3  Programma Nacional de Acesso ao Ensino Técnico e Emprego, National Program for Access to Technical Training and Employmentadulthood. To guarantee the right to learning, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) launched the Fora 
da Escola Não Pode!4 initiative to combat school exclusion.
In 2014, Instituto TIM entered into a partnership with UNICEF to develop the technological solution Busca Ativa 
Escolar, a free IT platform that will facilitate and encourage the work of municipalities in the active search for 
those 3.8 million children and teenagers. The objective is to provide high-level civil servants with an innovative 
approach, so that they can find out-of-school children using information and communications technologies 
(ICT).
This technical solution improves coordination of the various government departments, as everyone has access 
to the same database. This system enables each municipality to monitor children who do not attend school 
that are present in the territory under their responsibility. With this information collected, public officials have 
additional tools to monitor school exclusion in their municipalities and decide how to combat it. There are 
currently over 3,000 municipalities registered on the platform, equal to 54% of all municipalities in Brazil.
O Círculo da Matemática do Brasil (Brazilian Math Circle)
One of the greatest obstacles to scientific and technological progress in Brazil is the poor standard of maths 
teaching in schools. According to the Ministry of Education, only 42% of pupils in the third year of primary 
school can do simply arithmetic like addition and subtraction. In the PISA5 2018, based on the results obtained 
by students in math, Brazil ranked 70th out of a total of 79 countries on the list. 
Focusing on the very first years of primary school, the O Círculo da Matemática do Brasil (The Math Circle in 
Brazil) project, working with its founders, Harvard University Professors Bob and Ellen Kaplan, introduced the 
Math Circle approach in the country, adjusting and adapting its content to the Brazilian context.  The strength 
of the Math Circle lies in its educational aspect, according to which pupil participation and reflection are 
fundamentally important for acquiring mathematical knowledge. Since 2013, the project has involved 25,000 
pupils and 4,500 teachers in 29 cities.

Security and management of emergencies
With the aim of ensuring maximum cooperation, in terms of security and management of emergencies and 
crises, national and local institutions and affected communities, TIM has signed and implemented the 
following agreements:
■A “memorandum of understanding between the Department of Civil Protection of the Presidency of the 
Council of Ministers and the providers of electronic communication services to allow emergency 
information to be sent across national geographical areas.”
■An “agreement between the Crisis Unit at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and 
providers of electronic communication services for the supply of messaging services for Italian citizens 
abroad in emergencies.” 
■The “Convention for implementing a device to generate Missing Child Alert” launched with the Italian 
Ministry of the Interior, Department of Public Security; 
■A “contract for the supply of information on the location of SIM cards used in TIM phones” with the 
national mountain and cave rescue corps to locate people lost in the mountains.
Furthermore, as required by the relevant laws on training , we:
■test the soundness of the emergency planning and the ability of the company’s operational Crisis 
Management Systems to respond;
■maintain staff, structures and tools of the emergency management system in a state of readiness;
■Identify, where necessary, actions to improve internal company processes and the processes used to 
interface with the relevant stakeholders (institutions, communities and customers).
Throughout 2021, TIM took part in the “Leonessa 2021” drill on risks of Civil Defense, organized by the Brescia 
Prefecture.
TIM’s involvement in these drills is necessary as the company delivers essential services and is part of the 
National Civil Protection Department (Law 225/1992), together with other public and private organizations and 
the Ministry of the Interior’s Interministerial Technical Commission for Civil Defense. It should be noted that, 
compared to past years, the Institutions reduced the organization of both protection and civil defense drills to a 
minimum in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the area of training, with the goal of contributing to strengthening the culture of risk prevention and 
expanding the awareness and knowledge of safe conduct, TIM supported “ Io non Rischio ” (I Won’t Risk It), the 
national communications campaign on good civil protection practices, promoted by the Civil Protection 
Department.
Finally, TIM has made sure it is represented in national and local institutional crisis units – in times of both crisis 
and calm – and that service requests are satisfied and dealt with within 12 hours and 24 hours as set out in 
Prime Ministerial Directive 3.12.2008 on “operating directions for managing emergencies”.

TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 38Stakeholder engagement
TIM believes it is fundamentally important to consider the opinions and expectations of its stakeholders, that is 
to say the parties who for various reasons have an interest in or impact on the Company’s activities, and vice 
versa. 
[GRI 102-40]  The stakeholders with whom TIM comes into contact in the conduct of its business are many and 
very varied. To facilitate their management, stakeholders were grouped into seven main categories, as a result 
of the dual activities of benchmarking comparable companies and, in parallel, internal consultation:
Notes in the table:
a: by Authority is meant independent authorities, for example of supervision and control such as the Italian Communication Authority or the Italian 
data protection authority, or, in Brazil, ANATEL (National Telecommunications Agency) and MCTIC (Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and 
Communication).
b: the “Companies of the TIM Group” have been considered as stakeholders and, more specifically, as "Customers" (e.g. TMS - Telecom San Marino) 
and "Suppliers" (e.g. Olivetti) both to facilitate the mapping process of the stakeholders who have a relation with TIM and to highlight possible 
feedback issued to determine materiality. 
[GRI 102-42] [GRI 1024-3] The stakeholder engagement process takes place on a regular basis both during the 
course of the company's operations and in the implementation of specific projects. 
Based on the company’s business and other objectives, for each project: firstly, the stakeholders of reference 
are identified, then the processes for dialog and listening are studied and implemented (individual meetings, 
group meetings, information sessions, joint projects, surveys, focus groups, etc.), and, lastly, the most suitable 
solutions and initiatives are identified and implemented to provide a concrete response to their needs. 
Stakeholder involvement also continues beyond this and serves to monitor and adjust the development of 
initiatives.
In this regard, TIM has drawn up “general Guidelines for group stakeholder engagement” and a set of policies 
associated with different kinds of stakeholders (including customer service charters, a policy on relations with 
suppliers in purchasing processes, the code of conduct for protecting the data of other local operators, 
guidelines for relations with local authorities and other organizations, guidelines for voluntary contributions to 
the Community).
Among the various stakeholder engagement initiatives organized in 2021, the most important were the web 
conference " 5G: Innovazione, Opportunità e Regole ” [5G: Innovation, Opportunities and Rules], organized by TIM 
in partnership with Consumers’ Forum6. Following this event, representatives of 9 of the leading Italian 
Consumer Protection Associations were interviewed, including six associations participating in the protocol 
with TIM7, representing over 500 thousand members, which were engaged and listened to in discussing the 
risks and opportunities linked to 5G. The topics that arose during the event showed priority for the topics of 
privacy and data protection in addition to the correct use of data collected using 5G technology, topics which 
were found in the 2021 Materiality Analysis.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 396 This is an independent association created in 1999 and composed of the most important consumer protection associations, institutions, numerous 
industrial and service companies and their trade associations.

The Group is aware of the importance of providing accurate information on its activities to the financial 
market, investors and the community in general. Subject to the need for confidentiality in the running of the 
business, communication with the financial market is carried out in a way that ensures transparency, fairness, 
clarity, promptness and equality of access to information, ensuring equality of treatment for all categories of 
shareholders, as required by the bylaws. The external communication of information is governed by specific 
internal procedures, in line with the regulations in force. The Investor Relations Department manages relations 
with the main stakeholders: institutional and retail investors (including minority shareholders’ associations), 
bondholders, socially responsible investors, equity and credit analysts. The Company has set up dedicated 
channels of communication with shareholders, bondholders and stakeholders interested in receiving 
information about the financial and non-financial aspects of the Company. Once again in 2021, in line with the 
past and within the limitations imposed by the pandemic, the Company organized quarterly conference calls, 
online meetings and attendance at trade conferences; these activities were accompanied by direct contact 
and telephone conversations managed by the Investor Relations team on a daily basis.
In relation to TIM’s strong interest in establishing and maintaining a constant and ongoing relationship with 
institutional investors, managers, shareholders and the main stakeholders, in addition to its duty to the 
market, in November a meeting promoted by Assogestioni was held, involving around 20 managers, 
representing 10 asset management companies. During the meeting, topics linked to Group strategies, the 
increasing competitiveness of the market - linked to environmental and social factors - and the improvement 
of Company governance were discussed.
Lastly, financial communication focuses on the web as an important means of sharing information with the 
outside world: in this sense, the “Investors” channel on the website “gruppotim.it/en” is constantly updated 
with presentations of the Three-Year Strategic Plans, including the Sustainability Plan, the quarterly financial 
results, intermediate and annual reports, the Sustainability Report, notices and documentation useful for the 
Shareholders' Meeting and the financial calendar of the company. 
In addition to the web channel, the financial community and general community can contact the company 
using the dedicated email addresses at Investor_relation@telecomitalia.it and 
groupsustainability@telecomitalia.it or the twitter account www.twitter.com/TIMNewsroom.
[GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44]  The Group’s main stakeholder engagement initiatives taken in 2021 are summarized 
in the Appendix. 
In the diagram, each initiative is marked by an icon that represents the type of relationship:
■“information” refers to one-way communications by the Company with stakeholders; 
■“consultation” refers to the occasions when stakeholders are asked for their opinion through surveys or 
similar tools; 
■“dialogs” refers to the discussions and ongoing and stable cooperation between the Group and 
stakeholders; 
■“partnership” refers to the specific projects that are managed together.
In 2019, with the aim of knowing and analyzing the external vision with respect to the most relevant issues for 
its strategy, TIM invited a selection of its stakeholders to register in the area reserved for consultation on the 
RE2N collaborative platform8. 
Specifically, this initiative is part of the new methodology adopted by TIM for materiality analysis (described in 
the dedicated paragraph in this chapter) that leverages the potential of digital, including through sustainability 
activities. 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 408 a company that develops innovative tools for sustainability and Shared ValueMateriality Matrix
[GRI 102-46]  As envisaged in Legislative Decree 254/2016 and in accordance with the requirements of the 
Global Reporting Initiative Standards, TIM carried out the materiality analysis process again in 2021, to identify 
the priority socio-environmental and governance topics. 
Process to identify the material topics 
In addition to confirming the topics detected in 2020, the analysis to determine the 2021 topics change several 
topic names and descriptions to include new aspects and factors or emerging sub-topics. 
Initially, the taxonomy1 to be used in the semantic engine was updated. In addition to considering the most 
recent “sustainability” and “digital” references used in 20202, their number was increased by adding new 
sources deemed particularly important3. Moreover, for the first time, for the purpose of strengthening the 
entire process of structuring the taxonomy, a university technical committee was established.
Through the iterations and on the basis of occurrences4 present in the more than 200 documents analyzed, the 
new tree of relevant topics has been identified: 
■Climate change
■Cyberbullying, child pornography and online gambling
■Human rights
■Ethics and corporate governance
■Digital inclusion
■Infrastructure and emerging technologies
■Work and human capital
■Equal opportunities in the Company
■Procurement policies focused on Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) issues
■Privacy and cybersecurity
■Relations with customers
■Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) reporting
For the topic to be material for the Company and for external stakeholders, consultation activities were 
launched: internally, a significant sample of representatives of company management was asked to express 
their opinion by filling in an online questionnaire; externally, the usual online questionnaire, whose answers 
were suitably weighted, was enriched with big data analysis5, based on our collaborative platform6. 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 411 Each taxonomy is made up of interrelated concepts and keywords with different correlation and significance levels. Each taxonomy was 
constructed using both Italian and English terms.
2  Such as, for example, the Global Reporting Initiative Standard, ISO 26000, the Sustainable Development Goals or the DJSI - Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index.
3 Such as the EU Taxonomy or the TCFD - Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures.
4  Meaning the number of times that a concept (or a specific term) is detected within the document by the semantic engine. This provides an 
indication of the significance of the topic detected in the context of the document.
5 Using the TIM Data Room, the stakeholders’ points of view on the topics were investigated, examining both their statements made on the related 
institutional sites as well as the discussions posted on social networks.
6 On the TIM collaborative platform, stakeholders pertaining to the categories of the TIM Group were engaged and consulted. The 2021 TIM Materiality Matrix7, validated by the Control and Risk Committee in December 2021 along with 
the GRI indicators reported on in this document, is shown below:
The key issues for the Group and its stakeholders reflect the Sustainable Development Goals which TIM 
believes it can help achieve to a greater extent through its own personnel, technologies and services, adopting 
business policies that promote and safeguard human rights and the environment.
Specifically, the relevant Goals are:
■No. 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages;
■No. 4: Quality education
■No. 5: Gender equality
■No. 7: Affordable and clean energy 
■No. 8: Decent work and economic growth
■No. 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure
■No. 10: Reduced inequalities
■No. 11: Sustainable cities and communities
■No. 12: Responsible consumption and production
■No. 13: Take urgent steps to combat climate change and its consequences;
■No. 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions;
■No. 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable 
development.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 427 Based on the analysis of institutional sources, the opportunity arose to combine several topics which, as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic and in the current context, were no longer separate, but consequences of each other. For this reason, in 2021, 12 topics were identified 
instead of the 17 in 2020. Validation
The validation of the topics and of the entire materiality analysis process was carried out by the Investor 
Relations' Sustainability Planning and Performance Index Analysis department, with the support of RE2N and 
TIM Data Room. The results reported in the Matrix were validated by the Sustainability Committee and the 
Control and Risk Committee, and, following its approval, the Matrix forms the basis for creating the Group’s 
ESG-based Strategic Plan, in addition to the non-financial reporting for 2021. 
The review phase is due to take place as a preparatory stage prior to the next reporting cycle, with the aim of 
submitting the results of the analyses carried out, updated in the following year, to specific stakeholder 
engagement activities .
Boundaries 
[GRI 102-47] All the themes that are judged to be material have major implications both inside and outside the 
Company and are cross-cutting topics that are relevant to all the consolidated companies in the Group, 
wherever these may be, without exception, and which are relevant to all external and internal stakeholders, 
these being. The material topics identified, in order of importance, are:
■Infrastructure and emerging technologies
■Relations with customers
■Climate change
■Ethics and corporate governance
■Work and human capital
■Privacy and cybersecurity
■Digital inclusion
■Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) reporting
■Human rights
■Equal opportunities in the Company
■Procurement policies focused on Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) issues
■Cyberbullying, child pornography and online gambling
[GRI 102-49]  Finally, there have been no significant changes in the business perimeter (and therefore of 
boundary importance) in the last few years. During 2020, INWIT S.p.A. exited the scope of consolidation of the 
Group.
Material topics and Sustainable Development Goals in the ’22-‘24 Strategic Plan
For the Group, the Materiality analysis is an important tool to identify the most important ESG priorities, in line 
with its business strategy. 
The diagram below shows the 2021 ESG topics and the related sustainable development goals, aligned with 
the 6 pillars of the ’22-’24 Plan, described at the beginning of this report.  
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 43Sustainability governance system  
[GRI 102-18] [GRI 102-26] The Sustainability Committee, composed of independent directors and chaired by the 
Chairman of the TIM Group, performs consultation, proposal, monitoring and investigation duties, to support 
and steer the activities of the full board and the management, in the areas of environmental and social 
sustainability and governance (ESG), in terms of positioning, objectives, processes and specific initiatives of TIM 
and the Group.
The Committee interacts with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee with regard to possibly including 
ESG considerations in the remuneration policy (for example, for the incentive parameters and targets), in 
addition to monitoring the adoption and implementation of measures to promote equal treatment and 
opportunities between genders within the company organization and with the Control and Risk Committee in 
the preliminary analysis of the Sustainability Report/Consolidated Non-Financial Statement and in analyzing 
company ESG risks.
Responsibility for monitoring the Group's ESG issues and identifying sustainability projects and initiatives lies 
with the Sustainability Metrics & Performance Index Analysis department (SP&PIA) - of Investor Relations - and 
the Sustainability Projects & Institutional Digital Channels department (SP&IDC), which reports to the Head of 
Institutional Communications, Sustainability Project & Sponsorship. 
[GRI 102-32] The Sustainability Steering Committee, chaired by the CEO and composed of the Group’s main 
Departments and Companies, is responsible for overseeing drafting of the Sustainability Report/Consolidated 
Non-Financial Statement, including the materiality analysis. The Control and Risk Committee prepares the 
financial and non-financial communication for the period prior to examination by the full board.
[GRI 102-31] During 2021, the Board of Directors met with those responsible for sustainability activities in 
February for the ESG Plan and for the approval of the Sustainability Report, in addition to further meetings with 
the Sustainability Committee/Control and Risk Committee held in June, September, October and December.
[GRI 102-19]  Socio-environmental responsibilities are delegated, in the same way as all other powers delegated 
by the company, by applying the procedure granting and revoking powers. Specifically, [GRI 102-20]  the 
responsibility for communications on environmental and social issues lies with the SP&IDC department, while 
SP&PIA, coordinating with the Financial Reporting department, is responsible for planning and monitoring ESG 
issues as well as managing relationships with rating agencies and Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) investors. 
The responsibility for the drafting of the Sustainability Report lies with the Consolidated Financial & 
Sustainability Statements department of Financial Reporting, Accounting & Revenue Assurance. Responsibility 
for managing individual socio-environmental themes remains with the departments that directly manage 
operations relating to these themes.  [GRI 102-26]  These latter departments in particular identify specific 
strategies and targets for improving socio-environmental performance, each in its own area of responsibility, 
coordinating with the staff departments SP&IDC and SP&PIA.
 [GRI 102-21]  Responsibility for dialog with stakeholders is delegated to the departments that are operationally 
responsible for dealing with the Company’s stakeholders. However, it is noted that at the meeting of December 
16, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the Engagement Policy (available on the website gruppotim.it/en, 
About Us section – Governance/Governance Tools/Procedures channel), a document which formalized the 
matter of dialog with the entirety of shareholders, recommended by the Corporate Governance Code of Borsa 
Italiana.

TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 45Risk management
[GRI 102-15] [GRI 102-29] [GRI 102-30] [GRI 102-11] 
The TIM Group has adopted a Risk Management model that is constantly evolving, aligned with international 
regulations and standards, to allow the identification, assessment and management of risks in a uniform way 
within Group companies, highlighting potential synergies between the actors involved in the assessment of the 
internal control and risk management system. 
The Risk Management process is designed to identify potential events that may affect the business, to manage 
risk within acceptable limits and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of corporate 
objectives.
The Risk Management Model: 
■classifies risks based on their impact into:
•strategic (resulting from the evolution of factors underpinning the main assumptions used for the 
development of the Strategic Plan)  
•operational (resulting from the evolution of risk factors, both endogenous and exogenous, that might 
compromise the achievement of business targets); 
■assesses the risks not just individually but also in terms of the risk portfolio (correlation analyses);
■identifies and updates the overall set of risks to which the Group is exposed through:
•analysis of the Business Plan
•monitoring of the reference context (for example, the macroeconomic and regulatory context)
•specific analyses of risks to which corporate assets may be exposed
•cyclical monitoring and analyses with the Risk Owners, in order to intercept any changes and/or new 
risk scenarios. 
The approach adopted is dynamic and therefore requires a review of the risk scenarios not only following 
periodical assessments, but also at times of significant change within and outside the Group and when new 
risk situations are identified and/or occur. It also has cyclical pattern linked to the stages of the strategic 
planning process. 
The management process includes the following stages:
a. definition of the context and level of acceptance;
b. assessment;
c. handling;
d. communication and consultation;
e. monitoring and review;
f. recording and reporting. 
The process is managed by the Risk Management Steering Committee, which is chaired and coordinated by 
the Chief Financial Officer. The Steering Committee ensures the governance of the Group’s risk management, 
aimed at guaranteeing the operational continuity of the business, monitoring the effectiveness of 
countermeasures taken. 
For more details on the process and its phases, please refer:  www.gruppotim.it/it/sostenibilita/fondamenti-
business/gestione-rischio/risk-management.html
The Risk Management process carried out at Group level has highlighted that commercial activities of the 
Domestic BU show a different risk profile than those of TIM S.A. in Brazil. For greater clarity, descriptions of the 
solutions adopted in each perimeter have been reported separately.  The table below summarizes the risks 
associated with the material topics, while the Annual Report contains a brief summary of the main types of risk 
identified by the Risk Management system.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 46Material topics
ETHICS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Risks Management
Management of emergency civil defense 
events (conventional terrorist attacks, 
sabotage, etc.) and civil protection events 
(earthquakes, fires, volcanic eruptions, 
weather and hydrogeological events, 
industrial, environmental and health events, 
etc.), which could damage human resources, 
tangible and intangible resources of the Group.The TIM Group constantly improves its organizational model and processes 
of the Group Crisis Management System, updates emergency planning and 
procedures, keeps up the readiness of human resources involved in 
emergency/crisis management and the efficiency of management tools, 
through training and internal communication. As part of crisis 
management, to guarantee that essential communications services keep 
working for all stakeholders, drills are carried out to test the crisis 
management process and assess the responses and recovery times. In this 
regard, drills are organized to simulate the management of critical and 
emergency events caused by natural disasters, civil protection events, IT 
faults, etc.. As regards the management of the impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic, TIM immediately took all steps necessary to fully implement the 
emergency provisions issued by the government and regional authorities, in 
multiple tranches, to limit the virus contagion. TIM has extended the weekly 
agile working to all professional figures able to do so, including call center 
operators, and specific prevention and protection Protocols were defined, 
modulated taking into account the specific nature of the work at hand, for 
all those needing to continue to work on-field (technicians, store operators 
and data center operators), equipping them with suitable Personal 
Protective Equipment and, in line with the legal guidance and taking into 
account government and health authority guidelines, in accordance with 
Italian Legislative Decree no. 81/2008, a specific document has been 
formalized dedicated to COVID-19 and setting out all personnel protection 
measures aimed at preventing contagion.
In Brazil
Risks associated with corporate governance, 
the integration of strategy with values
and corporate culture, management of 
transactions with related parties and 
contracts, violations of anti-corruption laws. To 
prevent interruption in the supply of materials 
and the provision of services and network 
infrastructures, thereby guaranteeing business 
continuity and disaster recovery procedures.TIM has a policies and standards that regulate internal processes, consistent 
with the principles set forth in the corporate Code of Ethics and Conduct. In 
this way, we promise our stakeholders that we will adopt a responsible 
management approach. In accordance with the TIM Bylaws (article 29 (VII)), 
the Board of Statutory Auditors is in charge of reviewing, assessing and 
expressing an opinion on any contracts entered into between TIM or its 
subsidiaries and majority shareholders or affiliated companies (including all 
entities under common control or with a controlling stake in a majority 
shareholder of TIM or otherwise regarded as related parties), in order to 
ensure compliance with the requirements of free competition.
Since 2011, the Company has voluntarily joined Novo Mercado, the highest 
level of corporate governance on the Brazilian Stock Exchange, as well as 
being the first and only telecommunications operator named as a Pro-
Ethical (Pró-Ética) company by the Brazilian Comptroller General (CGU) and 
the first to obtain ISO 37001 certification, in 2021. As part of TIM's effort to 
increasingly improve its governance systems, the Company has goals and 
commitments in the 2021-23 ESG Plan regarding: customer satisfaction, 
ethics and transparency, security information and data privacy. In addition 
to these efforts, TIM aims to create efficient mechanisms to balance the 
interests of all its stakeholders equally.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 47Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) REPORTING
Risks Management
Risks connected with the integration of 
sustainability issues in the company’s strategic 
vision.Since 2020, TIM has placed sustainable development at the center of its 
long-term strategy, setting targets in environmental, social and governance 
areas, and integrating them with other targets of the Long-Term Business 
Plan.
The projects that TIM deploys to achieve these targets contribute to the 
implementation of 11 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 
United Nations Agenda 2030. The governance system envisages two 
committees dedicated to sustainability: one committee within the Board of 
Directors, chaired by the Chairman of TIM, with fact-finding and consulting 
functions and another managerial committee, chaired by the Chief 
Executive Officer, tasked with strengthening the operational synergies 
between the technological, business and staff departments of the Group 
Companies
Through the Sustainability Report, TIM communicates its environmental and 
social performance, guaranteeing transparency to its stakeholders.
In January 2021, TIM placed its first Sustainability Bond, with a value of 1 
billion euros, maturing in 8 years.
TIM oversees relations with its stakeholders through dedicated 
departments. These carry out various initiatives and projects to involve and 
consult stakeholders, to improve the Company's environmental, social and 
governance performance, maximizing reputation and value.
Sustainability Planning and Performance Index Analysis oversees the 
various stakeholder engagement initiatives and monitors their outcomes.
In Brazil
Risk related to the lack of integration of the 
corporate strategy on the theme of 
sustainable development and to the 
operational management issues in terms of 
the social, ethical and environmental impact 
of the company's activities.TIM supports and promotes important initiatives on topical ethical, 
environmental and social matters, and incorporates industry best practices 
into its governance approach. As part of its management approach, it has 
signed global treaties and programs and has raised awareness of these 
issues among both internal and external stakeholders. In addition, it 
promotes the continuous improvement of its environmental performance 
and compliance with the Group's regulations, regulatory requirements and 
guidelines, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development.
In 2020, for the first time, TIM made long-term commitments in its Strategic 
Plan in a joint effort with the Group. This shows that the operational 
activities are increasingly geared towards the responsible management of 
aspects that go beyond mere tax considerations and generate positive and 
lasting value for society.
The ESG Plan, updated annually since then, confirms and definitively 
integrates ESG aspects to the core business, presenting objectives and 
targets linked to what is most relevant to our stakeholders and the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 48WORK AND HUMAN CAPITAL
Risks Management
Implementation of the Upskilling/Reskilling 
plan. Personnel engagement. Hiring plan.TIM has launched a hiring program, searching out professional profiles that 
are compatible with the company reindustrialization/reorganization plan 
and a program for all personnel for the adjustment of competences in 
support of requalification, reskilling and upskilling processes, also regarding 
important insourcing of evolved and traditional, technical-specialized core 
activities
Following the 2020 Engagement Survey, the plan for TIM personnel has 
been prepared, with the aim of increasing engagement over a 3-year period. 
TIM has launched Well-Being initiatives to safeguard the well-being of its 
human capital, structured in various lines of action relating to the 
prevention of certain diseases (e.g. Cancer prevention), the promotion of 
exercise and physical activity (e.g. Partnerships with platforms to access 
fitness structures) and projects to reduce stress, such as participation in 
webinars, e-learning courses for well-being and psychological support 
services provided by external professionals.
In Brazil
Risks associated with monitoring employee 
performance and implementing practices that 
improve that performance, as well as policies 
for staff development and occupational health 
and safetyFor TIM, employees represent the company and drive performance through 
their knowledge, skills and attitudes. With a view to being recognized as an 
innovative company, the Company aims to attract and retain diverse 
talents, as well as provide motivation to its employees. The emergence of 
the Coronavirus pandemic has heightened the importance of focusing on 
employee health and well-being. The Company responded promptly with 
several measures such as frequent surveys and telemedicine services, as 
well as health care plans, and a number of existing benefits such as 
extended maternity and paternity leave.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also brought about a sharp transformation in 
labor relations around the world. For TIM, the challenge was no different. 
Employees have had to adapt to working remotely from home and 
assimilating to new digital skills. However, it was determined that TIM's 
willingness to provide resources, equipment and training to the work team 
has helped maintain continuity of services and restore the same level of 
efficiency.
TIM provides employees with training aimed at expanding skills and 
promoting the personal development of its employees. TIM employees 
participate in ongoing development programs and initiatives focused on 
technical skills, competencies and diversification factors aligned with the 
needs of the business. Our training model promotes knowledge sharing 
through understudy programs, in which employees observe how colleagues 
perform various tasks, as well as through feedback and discussions in 
forums and communities. Employees also participate in formal trainings, 
courses, lectures, and workshops, both in-person and online, and conduct 
reading exercises.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 49RELATIONS WITH CUSTOMERS
Risks Management
The risk correlated with the evolution of 
demand. Risks related to the application of the 
current legislation on privacy and to protection 
and security of personal data.The Company adopted a Quality and Customer experience surveillance and 
improvement model based on “quality by design”, with implementation in 
the departments of surveillance dedicated to defining, developing and 
verifying customer experience models, as well as planning, developing and 
verifying customer journeys. In this respect, KPIs and SLAs are defined 
consistent with the customer promise, by working together to define the 
improvement plans.
The various initiatives are based on transparency, simplicity and respect for 
the customer, with the objective of offering excellent customer experience.
Within this context, improvement plans were launched, with targeted 
actions aimed at transforming the culture and engaging all employees 
using innovative methods, such as the “make the difference” project 
dedicated to customer care workers rewarded based on the best customer 
experience offered. To drive this transformation TIM has developed an 
extensive listening system, which picks up on customer experience in the 
different “moments of truth” of the customer journey, for example: web 
browsing, purchasing a service, calling customer care, reporting a 
malfunction. Of the surveys conducted, the monitoring of the Customer 
Satisfaction Index (CSI), based on the ACSI standard (American Customer 
Satisfaction Index), is particularly significant. The aim is to collect 
information on the quality perceived by TIM customers and the main 
competitors.
TIM analyses its customer experience data to assess the risks connected 
with the adequacy of the offer in relation to the evolution of demand.
During this period of health emergency, TIM has supported customers with 
free of charge offers in the Consumer as well as Business segments. It 
offered citizens innovative digital solutions free of charge to support 
healthcare, families and older people and to ensure the continuity of 
educational activities in schools, TIM joined the MIUR project 
#LaScuolaContinua [lit: #SchoolGoesOn], providing platforms and 
information support to enable distance learning.
Through a system of procedures and controls, TIM ensures compliance with 
applicable regulations on the protection of personal data. With particular 
reference to the new privacy regulation GDPR No. 2016/679, the TIM Group, 
starting with the operating model already in place under current Privacy 
legislation, activated that necessary for compliance with GDPR, defining the 
Data Protection Officer organizational structure and processes.
In Brazil 
Risks associated with improving quality, 
innovation and customer experienceFor the Company, it remains an imperative to improve the experience and 
perception of this performance by users. 
TIM's three-year strategic plan aims to accelerate digital transformation 
and improve the customer experience with a quality and value proposition 
based on three strategic pillars:
• Create offers based on the individual needs of customers;
• Promote the expansion and evolution of the network infrastructure;
• Manage activities through integrated direct sales and service channels for 
an effective approach.
TIM reaches out to its customers by offering various physical or digital 
service channels. In managing service and process improvements, the 
Company takes into account customer feedback provided through these 
channels, conducts surveys and monitors systemic errors.
TIM also examines the customer experience through CX Monitoring, which 
allows structured monitoring of customer interactions based on control 
panels and satisfaction indicators. The data collected serves as input with 
which to improve the user experience. TIM is already able to manage 
recurring contacts attributable to the same cause, taking into account 
characteristics such as customer profile, age range and time period. Another 
initiative launched to improve the quality of data provision and telephony 
services is the Users' Council, a project by Anatel that brings together 
operators, users of the mobile segment and representatives of consumer 
protection bodies, aimed at increasing society's involvement in the provision 
of operator services. 
The multi-channel service system adapts to the customer's life: it operates 
24 hours a day, including the Call Center, and allows self-service for almost 
all services. Through the app, computer or phone, customers can submit 
complaints, questions or suggestions, self-manage their accounts, and 
purchase services and products.
In 2020, among the objectives of the ESG Plan, TIM set itself the goal of 
reducing, by 2023, the number of complaints with the regulatory body by 
50% compared to 2019. 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 50PRIVACY AND CYBERSECURITY
Risks Management
Risks related to the application of the current 
legislation on privacy and to protection and 
security of personal data.
Management of ICT risk guidance, prevention 
and monitoring procedures to set up 
appropriate countermeasures, manage the 
centralized security platforms and manage the 
monitoring process and IT incidents. 
Obsolescence of platforms and systems.TIM has a system of procedures and controls which ensure compliance with 
current regulations, puts in place concomitant monitoring activities on the 
evolution of the regulatory scenario and performs ongoing dissemination 
and internal training activities. 
With particular reference to the new privacy regulation GDPR No. 2016/679, 
starting with the operating model already in place under current Privacy 
legislation, the TIM Group activated that necessary for compliance with 
GDPR, defining the Data Protection Officer organizational structure and 
processes, extending the tools necessary to ensure compliance with the 
GDPR, also activating specific organizational oversights. In particular, a 
steering committee was established on compliance with the GDPR, 
overseen by the company’s senior management and that provides guidance 
in pursuing the conformity objectives. The conformity assessments have 
been submitted to the committee, along with the results of the ex ante and 
ex post controls carried out by the Compliance Department in accordance 
with the Group Data Protection Officer, who operate autonomously, in 
accordance with segregation of duties and who take part in the Company’s 
Internal Control System. The Company’s operative processes have been 
adapted according to the principle of privacy-by-design, with special 
attention paid to the commercial, relations with customers and 
technological processes, adopting the methods defined by corporate 
regulations dedicated to the application of the GDPR and which 
incorporates the directives of the Data Protection Authority. Personal data 
processing is subject to preventive assessment according to the indications 
of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), it is censused and the 
related responsibilities are attributed to the suitable managerial level of the 
Company’s organization, as envisaged by the Personal Data Protection Code 
in application of the accountability principle laid down by the GDPR. TIM 
constantly monitors the level of conformity with the GDPR, by adopting 
specific controls and risk indicators.
Protecting networks from the main threats (e.g. viruses, malware, hackers, 
data theft) was of fundamental importance. With a wide range of attackers 
(Cyber-Criminals, Cyber-Terrorists, Insiders, etc.), TIM carries out activities 
not only to safeguard its infrastructure but also – with a strong sense of 
responsibility – to protect customers' information assets, that are a priority 
target for the company. As regards prevention, TIM monitors cyber risk 
analyses, defining security plans for the company's IT assets, to identify the 
actions necessary to mitigate cyber risk in advance and guarantee a security 
by design approach, also monitoring the plans of these actions and controls 
on actual adoption in the field. As for its response to cyber attacks, the 
Security Operation Center (SOC), operates 24/7, 365 days a year, in order to 
manage IT security incidents and help limit their impacts. TIM has also 
implemented an insurance program to cover cyber risks.
In Brazil 
Risks related to information technology in 
terms of protection and security of personal 
data, confidentiality of information and 
enforcement of privacy regulationsThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) No. 13709/2018, which went 
into effect in September 2020, brought challenges for companies on a 
number of critical issues - data protection and customer privacy - further 
increasing the telecommunications industry's responsibilities. At TIM, these 
issues already form part of customer care.
To promote the structured management of the various activities necessary 
for compliance with the law, TIM has acted, among other things, through:
• the creation of the Privacy Committee;
• compliance with the legal requirements of the Data Subjects;
• the creation of the Privacy Center on the TIM website;
• the creation of an internal security flow for any accidents or leaks of 
personal data.
TIM conducts its activities on the basis of ISO 27001 - the international 
standard that describes best practices for information security 
management and NIST (Cyber Security Framework) that provides support 
for the management and reduction of information security risk. Although 
the company has not yet achieved ISO 27001 certification, the requirements 
for certification were assessed in 2020 and a level of compliance of more 
than 90% of the requirements was identified. Therefore, the Company will 
make the necessary adjustments to achieve certification in 2022.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 51INFRASTRUCTURE AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
Risks Management
Risks connected with the correct sizing of the 
fixed and mobile access network.TIM's technical departments oversee the company’s technological 
processes in the general context of the engineering and planning of 
network/service infrastructures, the development of next-generation 
networks (FTTx - 5G) and evolution towards cloud networks, also taking into 
account the quest for innovative services, which the commercial 
departments contribute to developing by organizing ad hoc service offers 
meeting the evolving needs of the community, companies and institutions. 
At the same time, the Company is moving forward with an integrated 
digital transformation program that includes the architectural and 
application simplification of IT systems and the network infrastructures.
As part of upgrading the network and 5G services, collaborations with other 
ecosystem players represent a fundamental lever to develop the intelligent 
infrastructure on which the global economy of the future and the services 
enabled by it will be based. The first half of 2021 saw the collaboration 
begun in 2019 within the Ministry of Economic Development (MISE) 
Competence Center for Industry 4.0 (Competence Industry Manufacturing 
4.0) continue, where TIM Innovation Labs collaborate with the Polytechnic 
and University of Turin, as well as with another 23 Turin companies for the 
research, testing and diffusion of Industry 4.0 solutions, including 5G, to 
SMEs. In May 2021, under the scope of the agreement between TIM and 
Google Cloud, stipulated in March 2020, for a technological collaboration for 
the creation of innovative public, private and hybrid cloud services to enrich 
the range of technological services offered by TIM, TIM and Noovle have 
launched the development of Italy's first “5G Cloud Network”.
TIM, during the first half of 2021 was one of Europe’s first operators (and the 
only one in Italy) to also launch an Open RAN (Open Radio Access Network) 
development program for the innovation of the mobile access network. This 
initiative will see the Group implement new solutions on its commercial 
network to benefit customers and businesses thereby speeding up the 
deployment of digital services.
TIM assesses and monitors the risks related to the development of the FTTX 
coverage plan for fixed telephony and 5G for mobile telephony, and the 
recovery actions aimed at reducing those risks.
In Brazil
Risks associated with the design and 
implementation of infrastructures for 
innovative solutions, the preparation and 
installation of network infrastructures.TIM is committed to providing the best user experience and guaranteeing 
quality in customer services. That is why it continually invests in expanding 
and improving its network infrastructure and coverage area. In doing so, it 
ensures the quality of its services and competitiveness in the sector, while 
complying with legislation. The perception of users that this is an essential 
service has increased the demand for network reliability.
TIM continued to invest in infrastructure, primarily in IT and technology 
projects, in 4G through 700M Hz, in the transport network and in FTTH 
expansion (to which around 13% of total investments made during the year 
were allocated).
These investments in infrastructure and network coverage enable user 
connectivity and, therefore, access to information is considered the main 
indirect economic impact generated by TIM.
In 2020, TIM signed a TAC (Term of Adjustment of Conduct) with Anatel, 
through which the company committed to bringing 4G to 350 municipalities 
with a low Human Development Index (HDI) and expand its infrastructure to 
a further 1,388 cities.
TIM recognizes its role as a technology leader in the country's 
telecommunications industry and as a leader in innovation. The Company 
seeks to meet new consumption and respond to the market in a proactive 
manner, following the change in the profile and behavior of its customers 
and in the new technologies to develop and offer products and services.
With respect to 5G, TIM believes that its implementation will help keep the 
Brazilian market abreast of international developments and boost 
innovation and knowledge creation.
The 5G auction was held in November 2021 and TIM acquired 11 lots, with a 
total value offered of R$ 1.05 billion, in 3 frequency bandwidths: 3.5 GHz, 2.3 
GHz and 26 GHz. The bandwidths acquired have a series of obligations that 
must be satisfied with financial contributions or the construction of mobile 
and fixed network infrastructures. Consequently, TIM guarantees the 
spectrum capacity necessary to pursue its growth nationally on the mobile 
market, being ready to respond to its customers’ demands and to explore 
new applications and develop innovative solutions calling for high speed 
connectivity and capacity.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 52EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COMPANY
Risks Management
Risks related to the protection of workers’ 
rights.TIM pays particular attention to the issues of inclusivity and valuing 
diversity, for their positive impact on the ability to generate innovation and 
improve performance, increasing people's productivity and the quality of 
their working life. An inclusive organization that puts the value of 
individuals, with all of their characteristics, in the center of it all, increasing 
company well-being and also improving the work-life balance.
This process began with the development of the internal awareness of this 
issues and, subsequently, specific processes were launched to promote 
various types of diversity.
TIM was among the first Italian companies to set up an Equity & Inclusion 
Management program: in 2009, the year in which the Diversity Manager 
was appointed.
TIM oversees Equity & Inclusion projects which are effectively considered a 
driver for development of people and the organization, as well as an integral 
part of the new TIM Welfare System. The “Progetto Donna” [Woman 
Project] project, is particularly important. This represents TIM's commitment 
to increase the culture of equal opportunities and accelerate the 
professional growth of women in the company.
In Brazil
Risks connected with the integration of the 
strategy into company values and culture, 
talent management and issues of 
sustainability and social responsibility.Promoting a corporate culture of respect and appreciation of the differences 
between people has become a key issue. TIM believes that the more diverse 
a group is, the greater the exchange of experiences and solutions, which 
contributes to a healthy work environment, with benefits for the processes 
of attractiveness, engagement, innovation and competitiveness.
The theme’s governance is headed by a dedicated management team 
within the area of Human Resources, responsible for the formalization of 
policies, programs and structured initiatives, in line with the ESG strategy 
and internal culture. Established across the board, the commitments 
envisaged by the Diversity and Inclusion Program guide internal processes 
on gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, different generations and people 
with disabilities. And through a diversity and inclusion calendar that follows 
the UN's international agenda, the communication and training plan, made 
available to all employees and managers, continually promotes broad 
reflection and dialog on the topic, as well as on the specific challenges faced 
by minorities.
With regard to senior management, the Diversity and Inclusion Committee 
monitors and evaluates ongoing initiatives, under the coordination of the 
TIM Chairman.
At the forefront of awareness and engagement efforts, Affinity Groups, 
created in 2020, have mobilized nearly 500 employee volunteers, working to 
foster a welcoming space for dialog, sharing ideas, mapping gaps, and 
proposing and implementing initiatives that promote diversity and an 
increasingly inclusive culture .
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 53DIGITAL INCLUSION
Risks Management
Risks connected with the integration and 
management of sustainability issues in the 
company’s strategic vision. 
Risk of insufficient/delayed investments for 
digitalization of the country.TIM also works on social digital inclusion, especially in terms of economic 
benefits and specific measures for certain categories of customers, such as 
deaf, blind or visually impaired customers, customers with low income who 
are in a situation of "economic hardship" and "social card" holders. 
In addition, TIM guarantees to support customers residing in areas affected 
by natural disasters (seismic events, floods), both in the phase of 
emergency management and in the medium/long term, to protect their 
needs. 
With “Operazione Risorgimento Digitale”, TIM, working with the main 
consumer protection associations, has developed free webinars for all 
individuals and consumers, to educate them in the informed, safe and 
secure use of the internet, to capture all opportunities and benefits of digital 
life, preventing the main online risks: from how to correctly use digital tools 
to manage money to online purchases, to new methods of accessing 
information, products and services. 
An extensive education program for people of all ages, in all parts of Italy. 
Free online courses to inform people of the opportunities offered by the 
digital universe and to simplify life through the day-to-day use of new 
technologies.
For companies, “Operazione Risorgimento Digitale”  hosts: conferences, i.e. 
direct training and information sessions for a limited number of attendees 
for SMEs that intend to undertake or have begun their process of digital 
transformation; workshops targeted to specialists, on a specific issue for 
training purposes, lasting 1 hour and a half, featuring surveys and Q&A 
sessions.
In Brazil
Risks associated with the lack of integration of 
the company's strategy on sustainable 
development issues and matters attributable 
to operational management in terms of social, 
ethical and environmental impact, as well as 
the lack of innovation in the company's 
activities, products, solutions and technologies.The Company believes that collective transformations through individuals 
and companies can be important drivers of change. In its 2021-23 ESG Plan, 
TIM emphasizes that new skills are a key factor in maintaining its leadership 
and for this it translates its social performance into goals through themes 
such as diversity and inclusion, engagement, training and digital inclusion.
Widespread access to mobile telephony and the Internet, according to TIM, 
represents an opportunity and a transformation in the lives of many people. 
With the pandemic, the process of digitizing countless activities and services 
has been accelerated. As a result, there has been an urgent need for the 
telecommunications sector to provide accessible solutions to the majority of 
the population. The trend toward greater use of technology and 
connectivity, both in private life and in businesses and essential public 
services, reinforces the importance for TIM to extend access to 4G 
connectivity to all municipalities in Brazil by 2023.
The social investment strategy implemented by TIM aims to promote the 
social inclusion of disadvantaged groups in Brazilian society, particularly 
children and teenagers, by running educational programs relating to 
Science, Technology and Innovation.
Instituto TIM was founded in 2013, with the aim of defining strategies and 
providing resources for the dissemination of science, technology and 
innovation to support the development of community in Brazil. 
Instituto TIM’s work has already reached all 26 Brazilian states and the 
Federal District, involving over 700,000 people.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 54ESG PROCUREMENT POLICIES
Risks Management
Excessive concentration of activity by TIM on 
one supplier, reducing negotiation abilities 
and/or entailing significant impacts on the 
interruption of the service.
Risks relating to delays in or shortages of 
critical productsAt TIM, the supply chain process has recently been revised, to streamline it 
and decrease its dependence on possible problems linked to suppliers.
With regard to the latter aspect, the risk of a high concentration of activity 
by TIM on one supplier is emphasized as a potential cause of business 
interruption: the controls recently implemented by Procurement, aimed at 
reducing the risk of dependence, limit the overall level of this risk. Also 
regarding the potential risk of excessive dependence of turnover of suppliers 
on TIM, which could give rise to disputes and possible damages to 
reputation, no specific problems were found
TIM, in the supplier qualification phase, in accordance with the Anti-
Corruption Policy, provides for the adoption of due diligence questionnaires 
and the application of the conflict of interest procedure. In addition, in 
accordance with the Group’s environmental policy, the company also 
selects its suppliers and partners and purchased or outsourced products and 
services on the basis of environmental sustainability criteria and assesses 
products and services taking into account their whole life cycle, periodically 
checking compliance with the above criteria. The company recently issued a 
policy on the purchasing of products and services which states that one of 
the aims of the purchasing process is to contribute to environmental 
protection by identifying solutions able to minimize impact on the 
ecosystem, by outlining obligations and responsibilities with a view to 
continuous improvement. The Company also identifies and assesses the 
environmental risks generally present at the various stages of its supply 
chain and, in close collaboration with its direct suppliers and also through 
partnerships at national and international level, takes appropriate corrective 
actions and adopts improvement plans to reduce the environmental impact 
of products and services purchased and the processes with which they are 
produced. Periodic spot checks are also made on Risk linked to the selection 
and purchase orders to ascertain whether there are purchases of goods for 
resale and production that do not comply with the provisions of the conflict 
minerals regulation.
Finally, Ethics and social Sustainability checks are carried out in order to 
assess both suppliers' adherence to schemes and principles of ethical 
business conduct and the adoption of procedures to ensure the health, 
safety and rights of workers, compared with the principles underlying the 
Global Compact and using international parameters referring to the SA 
8000 and ISO 14001 standards.
Work groups have been set up to identify, assess and mitigate risks relating 
to the supplies of critical products such as chipsets and polymer which, in 
this pandemic period have been impacted by problems of shortages and 
price hikes, as well as transport.
In Brazil
Risks related to the selection and qualification 
of suppliers and supply chain management.TIM's Supplier Relationship Policy presents the sustainability commitments 
required of its suppliers, including subcontractors, from respect for human 
rights to environmental standards. Through contracts, suppliers agree to 
conduct their business and operations in accordance with legal 
requirements and good compliance practices.
The contracts also require suppliers to comply with TIM's Compliance 
Program, which includes the Code of Ethics and Conduct and the Principles 
of the Global Compact, with express mention of the rejection of child or 
slave labor.
To monitor possible risks in its supply chain, TIM conducts ethical, conflict-
of-interest and social-environmental questionnaires with its suppliers prior 
to their engagement.
CYBERBULLYING, CHILD PORNOGRAPHY AND ONLINE GAMBLING
Risks Management
Risks associated with the management of 
activities in the field of logic security (cyber 
security, information/security system 
protection), penalties from regulatory non-
compliance and risks to reputation and 
compliance with relevant regulations 
(Legislative Decree 231/2001).The TIM Group – in accordance with current regulations – provides the 
customer with a series of tools to protect minors from accessing the 
sensitive content provided, providing constant updating and related 
communication.
TIM deploys resources, technologies, processes and tools to prevent and 
tackle “abuse”, i.e. any activity committed in violation of the rules of 
conduct and the legislation that govern the use of network services, digital 
systems or means of communication in general with continuous supervision 
carried out by the Security Operations Center in collaboration with the 
involved internal departments and with the competent external authorities.
In Brazil
Risks related to cybersecurity, access to 
information and personal data security, 
confidentiality of information and 
enforcement of privacy regulations.TIM is part of the cooperation agreement against pedophilia with SaferNet 
and other bodies/companies, taking on the task of fighting and preventing 
crimes committed via the Internet.
TIM offers adult content services and as a child protection measure, users 
wishing to access the content provider's web portal must declare that they 
are of legal age, via a disclaimer with a password to restrict access to 
minors. Furthermore, TIM limits its adult content portfolio to the 3.2 
classification (international code).
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 55HUMAN RIGHTS
Risks Management
Risks of compliance with the relevant 
legislation (Legislative decree 231/2001)The TLC sector is strategic for respecting human rights, as it generates 
impacts, for example, on the accessibility of technology and services 
(geographic and social digital inclusion), specifically for the most vulnerable, 
the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, the right to freedom 
of expression, specifically online, the protection of minors from adult 
content and gambling, from cyberbullying and harassment, and 
electromagnetic fields.
TIM’s commitment to human rights is reported in its Code of Ethics and 
Conduct and in all relevant policies, as in those regarding Human Resources, 
suppliers and customers, specifically the most vulnerable. In 2002 TIM 
signed the United Nations Global Compact, committing to being a pro-
active leader in initiatives and networks regarding human rights, both at 
local and international level, within and across sectors.
The Group makes grievance mechanisms available to be used in the event 
of a violation, as expressly required by the Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights. These mechanisms are available on the Group’s 
websites.
In Brazil
Risks associated with creating a corporate 
culture and values, as well as social, ethical 
and environmental impacts that are not in line 
with the strategic planAs a signatory to the Global Compact since 2008, TIM holds itself 
responsible for promoting and respecting human rights. Since 2015, TIM has 
been a member of the Working Group on Human Rights established by the 
Global Compact Network Brazil. In carrying out its activities, TIM agrees that 
it is important to respect rights such as data protection, Internet security, 
access to information and freedom of speech.
As part of the due diligence process, the Human Rights Capacity Diagnostic 
(HRCD) questionnaire, developed by the Global Compact Network Germany, 
is used to assess the level of human rights engagement and management 
in relevant departments. We believe that the stakeholders most vulnerable 
to the impact of these factors are children and adolescents, women, people 
with disabilities, and the elderly.
TIM also makes a whistleblowing channel available to internal and external 
stakeholders, in both Portuguese and English. The channel can be used to 
file complaints and report human rights concerns. The identity of the 
whistleblower remains confidential, unless otherwise required by law. It is 
also possible to submit reports anonymously.
TIM’s stakeholders and employees at all levels are bound by a set of internal 
rules that certify the Company's commitment: TIM Group's human rights 
policy; the policy on relations with suppliers and the social responsibility 
policy. The Code of Ethics and Conduct is also part of these regulations.
In addition, TIM has an online human rights course that is available to all 
employees on TIM's training platform.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 56CLIMATE CHANGE
Risks Management
Hydrogeological risk linked to the flooding of 
waterways and windstorm risk (non-tropical 
storms and tornadoes).
Risks connected with climate change and 
energy consumption.The climate change recorded in the last few years has resulted in the 
occurrence of extreme weather including flash floods and windstorms, 
which make climate risk an emerging risk. The widespread distribution 
throughout the country of TIM’s assets needed to carry out its business 
therefore exposes the company to possible direct and indirect damages 
deriving from these events. In the last quarter of 2020, analyses were 
conducted to estimate the potential direct loss (property damage) deriving 
from the occurrence of such phenomena. Specifically, probability analyses 
were conducted both for overflows/flash floods and for storms.
In particular, that assessment was conducted to estimate the potential 
impact of a catastrophic event.
The actions deployed, such as overflow protection systems, appropriate 
locations of plants and interment of wires where possible, make it possible 
to limit damages associated with the most frequent situations.
Moreover, to cover the losses deriving from this type of event and, more 
specifically, to cover catastrophic losses, the TIM Group has set up a suitable 
All Risks Property insurance program.
In terms of energy, TIM is constantly committed to improving its 
performance, adopting purchasing policies that take account of 
environmental issues and proposing innovative technological solutions for 
lowering environmental impact.
Moreover, each year the company sets a goal of reducing emissions and 
energy consumption, even in relation to continuous development of next 
generation networks, while increasing the use of energy from renewable 
sources in the corporate processes. In this regard, TIM has defined a 
structured process to optimize and monitor energy consumption within the 
group. Lastly, TIM’s strategy for the environment in the energy field includes 
areas of action featuring management strategies to optimize the use of 
energy sources and natural resources.
In addition, TIM’s new project to organize its corporate spaces plan provides 
for the optimization of such spaces, with the introduction of desk sharing 
and an increase in smart working, for example extended to Caring, which 
will make it possible to rationalize workstations and close some offices. This 
will significantly cut property management-related costs, as a result of: 
closing offices (vacating offices, reducing operating costs, sublease) and 
related energy consumption.
TIM has also activated a process of “climate risk” assessment and 
management, in line with the ESG strategies defined in the Business Plan.
In Brazil
Risks related to the lack of and/or inefficient 
practices for the use and management of 
energy, as well as social, ethical, and 
environmental impacts that are not consistent 
with the strategic planTIM manages climate-related risks and sees climate change as an 
opportunity to create solutions to mitigate its emissions and those of its 
customers. Extreme weather events can damage a company's facilities and 
infrastructure, directly impacting business. Therefore, TIM considers studies 
and corrective actions to be important to anticipate these negative effects, 
as well as for the development of structured processes and practices.
One example of this activity was the decision to map the occurrence of 
extreme weather events, over the long term, by inventorying the 
infrastructure that is most vulnerable and which poses the greatest risk to 
TIM, such as the sites, BTS, industrial buildings, Greenfield sites, rooftops, 
etc.
Based on this risk study, TIM also carried out an adaptation survey for each 
of the climatic events assessed. And since 2019, it has proposed a plan that 
includes the main climate risk monitoring measures, as well as the related 
corrective actions.
Energy scarcity is another factor that would lead to negative impacts on 
TIM's operations, such as a consequence of prolonged droughts. As such, 
the company has taken initiatives to reduce energy consumption and 
continues to increase the weight of renewable energy in its portfolio, such 
as the Distributed Generation Project, with investments underway since 
2017 and aims to reach 60 company-owned units by the end of 2022, 
including solar, hydro and biogas plants.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Governance 57Approach to environmental protection and the fight against 
climate change1   
[GRI 103-1, 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 302] [GRI 305] [GRI 306] [GRI 307]   In 2021, TIM went beyond 
the objectives of the previous Sustainability Plan with a target of zero Scope-2 emissions in 2025, compared to 
the previous -70%. This target will be reached due to the purchase of renewable energy to cover 100% of the 
domestic needs, which Brazil  will align with, in the new 22-24 Plan, increasing its share of renewable energy to 
100%.
The year 2021 began with TIM issuing a Sustainability Green Bond for 1 billion euros and a Sustainability-Linked 
Bond for 216 million euros in Brazil .
2021 also saw TIM take on the guidelines of the Science Based Target Initiative: in July TIM sent its letter of 
commitment to SBTi in which it expressed its ambition to contribute, through near-term targets and related 
actions, to holding global warming to below 1.5 °C; in November the targets relating to Scope 1 and 2 and 
Scope 3 emissions were sent to SBTi, validation of which is expected by SBTi in the first half of 2022. The goal 
of Carbon Neutrality2 by 2030 remains firm. TIM is deploying the most suitable actions to achieve this goal, 
based on an interfunctional analysis that takes shape in the energy transition matrix of TIM Domestic.
Moreover, the new 2022 Sustainability Plan will steer the Group towards new environmental objectives, 
illustrated in the chart below.
The TIM Group has always been aware of its role in building a low-carbon future: every ICT company can make 
a specific contribution to reducing global emissions thanks to its distinctive solutions: videoconferencing 
platforms, smart working, telemedicine, sharing platforms and e-learning are all services that can encourage 
more sustainable lifestyles and ensure the performance of activities while safeguarding the environment3.
The TIM Group is also present and active in industry associations and non-profit organizations whose objectives 
include environmental protection4. The relevance of environmental issues for TIM is also highlighted in the 
materiality matrix that incorporates the assumptions of the Sustainable Development Goals translated into 
the TIM strategy for the environment, which is described and disseminated through the Group Environmental 
Policy5:
■definition of guidelines and management procedures for optimizing the use of energy sources and natural 
resources; allocation of human, technological and economic resources for actions to protect the 
environment;
■progressive reduction of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions;
■selection of suppliers and partners, products and services based on environmental sustainability criteria;
■Application of environmental sustainability criteria in assessing potential mergers and acquisitions. 
■development of solutions and products that contribute to the fight against climate change;
■variable remuneration for management upon the achievement of objectives with a positive environmental 
impact;
■dissemination to employees and stakeholders of a correct approach to environmental issues.
In this regard, TIM has proposed a training plan to internal staff and business partners with training meetings 
on environmental issues for a total of 3,795 hours. 
TIM areas with a potentially significant environmental impact have adopted an Environmental Management 
System (EMS) certified in accordance with ISO 14001 to manage their operating processes in a sustainable 
way. 
In some cases, the EMS is integrated with the Quality Management System based on the ISO 9001 standard, 
for which the relative certification has been obtained. 
At some particularly important sites, an Energy Management System has been developed. 
In line with previous years, TIM, through the Energy & Utilities Management department and the Group's 
company Noovle S.p.A., has once again obtained ISO 50001 certification for its offices in Bologna (via 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Environment 591 The scope of reporting of the Non-Financial Statement coincides with the Annual Financial Report. Also note that the scope of environmental data 
reporting excludes the companies with fewer than 30 employees, as their environmental impacts are deemed immaterial. The TIM Group 
companies included in the scope of environmental reporting are listed below: TIM S.p.A, Olivetti, Noovle S.p.A., Telsy SpA, TI Sparkle Italia, TI

and Acilia. Note that in 2021, all data centers and offices in the domestic scope were fueled by renewable 
energy. By mid-2021, all the TIM stores were also fueled by renewable energy.
In Brazil , the operational activities of the technical network in the States of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and 
Espirito Santo – the areas in which the country’s industrial and commercial activities are mostly concentrated - 
have had an ISO 14001 certification since 2010. The activities of TIM S.A. are also carried out in accordance with 
the company's environmental policy, revised in 2021, which reinforces its commitment to reduce waste and 
use natural resources in a sustainable way.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 302] [GRI 305] [GRI 306] [GRI 307] TIM has always been committed to 
implementing energy efficiency and rational resource consumption programs: the Procurement Department 
includes the Energy Management & Procurement section, which focuses on energy issues and is tasked with 
identifying and finalizing suitable energy efficiency measures in Italy. Furthermore, in connection and 
functional coordination with the competent structures of the Chief Technology Office, the department ensures 
consistency in the design and implementation of the solutions adopted with respect to the Company's 
efficiency plans. 
In Brazil  energy is a material issue given the continued grid expansion activity. 
A BPR (Business Process Redesign) is being developed that will examine the various processes related to 
energy management, aiming to increase the focus on this issue by combining end-to-end management 
activities. This program includes energy efficiency measures and is part of the operational goals for all areas 
directly involved. In addition to this, TIM Brasil continues to implement projects to reduce energy consumption, 
such as the Decommissioning project launched in 2017, which involves adjustments to network equipment 
while virtualization is encouraged, equipment is replaced with equipment that is more efficient, and unused 
equipment is removed. The effective application of the electricity sector regulations is monitored by a control 
system, based on periodic assessment procedures reviewed by those responsible for limiting energy 
consumption. Taking into account these activities and responding to the goal of reducing the environmental 
impacts, and reinforcing efficiency initiatives, a report has been produced that describes the activities 
implemented to contain consumption, the results obtained and the status of improvement. In terms of 
governance, TIM Brasil uses a centralized management area for all electricity at the BSO (Business Support 
Office). The Energy and Efficiency area includes 6 professionals responsible for controlling and planning 
electricity consumption, monitoring energy efficiency projects and controlling the evolution of regulatory issues 
as well as energy purchases. The TIM Power Plant project was launched in partnership with Enel, in the state of 
São Paulo, to generate electricity from the burning of biological material. Biogas plants are based on anaerobic 
digestion, a fermentation process in which waste from landfills is digested by microorganisms to produce 
methane gas (biogas). Biogas is converted into mechanical energy using an internal combustion engine. The 
mechanical energy then rotates an electrical generator that generates electricity. Expected production: 27.96 
GWh/year.
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 302] [GRI 305]  The performance of the Group's key indicators is 
shown in the table below.

TIM Group Non-financial statement Environment 60The actions taken by TIM in the fight against climate change can be summarized by three guidelines:
■actions to reduce its own direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions and contain the emissions from 
other sectors and customers by supporting dematerialization and offering services and solutions that 
promote new sustainable ways of working, learning, traveling and living; 
■communication of its emissions and strategies for combating climate change in the Sustainability Report 
and through the responses provided to the rating agencies (RobecoSAM, VigeoEiris, Oekom, FTSE4Good), 
TIM participates in the CDP survey in both Italy and Brazil. TIM Brasil has been confirmed for the fourteenth 
consecutive year in the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) and has been selected to compile the Carbon 
Efficient Index (ICO2) and the S&P/B3 Brazil ESG, all within the scope of the São Paulo Stock Exchange (B3). 
TIM Brasil also publishes its GHG emissions in the Public Emissions Register of the Brazilian GHG Protocol 
Program. TIM Brasil has also been selected to compile the ICDPR-70, the Climate Resilience Index launched 
by CDP Brazil and partners in 2020.
■spreading a culture in support of the actions that everyone can implement to contribute to the reduction of 
emissions. Digitalization and dematerialization to achieve energy savings and reductions in CO2 emissions 
into the atmosphere: TIM’s solutions and products represent a real opportunity for climate change 
mitigation. In particular:
•audio/videoconferencing services and flexible work 
•online billing and payments 
•telemedicine services 
•infomobility systems 
•consumption analysis and monitoring systems 
In all cases, these are services characterized by reduced energy consumption that, in addition to optimizing 
production processes and logistics flows, help customers to reduce the emissions generated by physical travel 
and reduce energy consumption. 
The improved efficiency, savings in economic terms and reduction of environmental impacts associated with 
the effective use of TIM services also represent a real business opportunity for the Company: the sensitivity of 
stakeholders and citizens towards issues related to climate change is growing, resulting in a focus on 
companies capable of ensuring a sustainable future for the planet and society. 
The risks associated with climate change for the TLC sector have implications of a physical, economic and 
regulatory nature, with repercussions on the image and reputation of the Group companies. 
For TIM, the risk of flooding is one of the most serious physical risks with the highest probability of occurrence. 
The associated damage impacts the reduction in usage up to and including the loss of business infrastructure, 
resulting in zero service delivery capability. 
In order to prevent the potential damage, TIM's new exchanges and buildings are built at a safe distance from 
rivers and bodies of water in general and, in order to ensure continuity of service, the network is designed 
considering appropriate levels of resilience and redundancy. 
Network infrastructures in areas of high hydrogeological risk are monitored using the TIM Ci.Pro system. - Civil 
Protection, which uses a continuously updated land and infrastructure database for timely planning of 
necessary interventions. 
Company assets inevitably subject to physical risks have insurance coverage commensurate with the value of 
the property, equipment and severity of the potential damage with respect to the service they provide.
In Brazil , 65% of national electricity comes from hydroelectric generation6. 
For this reason, extreme levels of rainfall or long periods without rain can compromise the water level in 
reservoirs and impact the national energy supply. In this case, TIM may be affected by energy rationing 
measures and fluctuations in the average kWh price due to the effects of climate change, as well as the 
increase in the average value of the CO2 Emission Factor associated with power generation from the GRID. In 
addition, increases in the frequency and strength of extreme weather conditions could damage transmission 
towers, increasing business expenses due to having to acquire new equipment and maintain existing 
equipment. This could also lead to increased insurance costs and signal interruption or loss of quality to the 
detriment of telecommunications services. In addition, changes in air humidity and salinity have a direct effect 
on assets and equipment located underground and near coastal areas, resulting in increased operating costs. 
In the event of an increase in average temperature, the cooling of electronic devices, whose performance is 
directly related to stable temperatures, may require an excess of energy. It should be pointed out that climate 
change could also increase the cost of staff absences, as well as cause greater difficulty in reaching workplaces 
or locations where staff are located, which would have an indirect impact on business performance.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Environment 616 According to the Brazilian National Energy Balance 2019 (BEN, 2019).Electromagnetism and compliance with environmental legislation
The Group has always paid great attention to the issue of electromagnetic emissions which specifically consist 
of:
■careful management of its equipment during its entire life cycle and in compliance with current regulations 
and internal standards of efficiency and safety;
■in designing and optimizing the radio access network, guaranteeing that serious attention is paid to the 
issue of electromagnetic emissions at every stage of the equipment life cycle.
■use of, and constant research into, the latest technological instruments for checks and controls.
Systematic monitoring of the levels of electromagnetic field emissions from plants is aimed at ensuring 
compliance with legal limits and maintaining high safety standards for the population and workers. 
Despite Italian regulations on electromagnetic emissions being among the strictest in the world, with levels set 
much lower than the European average, checks carried out in Italy have shown that electromagnetic emissions 
generated are within the legal limits. 
TIM invests in the development of software for the prediction of electromagnetic field emissions, which is 
continuously updated to the state of the art. In particular, the GUARDIAN tool calculates the level of exposure 
of sites that host aerials and ensures that the levels established by law are respected. 
Combined with the TIM plan design platform, its use allows the location of sites and orientation of the aerials in 
relation to a specific context (housing, roads, meeting places) to be optimized. 
TIM also participates actively in the committees and working groups of the CEI (Italian Electrotechnical 
Committee) and the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) for issuing guidelines and technical 
standards on methods used to measure and forecast levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields issued by 
mobile radio systems. 
Accurate planning and optimization of the mobile radio network (optimum choice of sites, optimum use of 
radio transmission parameters) improves the efficiency of the network for the same amount of coverage, 
maximizing the capacity and quality of the service and minimizing interference, thus contributing to reducing 
the power transmitted by mobile terminals and base transceiver stations. 
In 2021 the following activities continued:
■support and training for local organizations in Electromagnetic Impact Analysis (EIA) activities;
■evolution of software tools developed internally to predict exposure (GUARDIAN); 
■evolution of the ARPIE web application for monitoring and evaluation of the average power transmitted by 
base transceiver stations of 2G, 3G and 4G systems in compliance with Legislative Decree 179/2012 
"Further urgent measures for the growth of the country" and its application guidelines;
■Preparation of guidelines aimed at the territorial realities of designing the access network of 5G 
technology, with the implementation of the methodologies provided for by the regulatory framework of 
the international and national sector;
■Participation in joint TIM-ARPA round tables for the implementation of 5G network design methodologies.
In addition, the introduction of Active Antenna Systems, which make it possible to generate irradiation 
diagrams "on a user basis" and no longer only on a "cell basis", has required a review of the design criteria and 
regulatory aspects related to the issue of exposure to electromagnetic fields. 
For this reason, TIM has been involved in and contributed to the activities carried out and still underway by the 
international (IEC, NGMN, 3GPP) and national (CEI, ISPRA-SNIPA) reference standards bodies. 
The APOGEO procedure has been applied to mobile radio systems allowing TIM to ensure that its systems are 
built in full compliance with the design, which in turn is fully compliant with legal requirements for protecting 
the health of the population. 
APOGEO is an innovative methodology, patented by Telecom Italia in 2003 at the European Patent Office, 
which uses high precision topographic and satellite instrumentation for the 3D survey of all GSM, UMTS, LTE 
and Radio Bridge radiant systems and their infrastructures.
With regard to the development of the 5G system, it is important to remember that the current limits, defined 
with a wide safety margin by law, are not related to specific technologies, but cover all emissions including 
small cell solutions that, due to their intrinsic technological nature, use radio powers lower than those of the 
Base Transceiver Stations.
In light of these considerations, the electromagnetic emissions generated by 5G technology do not appear to 
represent a business risk. The emission levels associated with base transceiver stations and wireless networks, 
designed and built in compliance with the current regulatory framework, are fully in line with the safety and 
precautionary criteria set out in national and international legislation. 
TIM, along with the entire telecommunications sector, pays attention to the issue by proactively monitoring 
possible developments and always acting in compliance with legislation. 
In Brazil  the non-ionizing radiation emitted by TIM S.A.'s base transceiver stations is fully within the 
parameters dictated by the World Health Organization and adopted by the National Telecommunications 
Agency (ANATEL). Non-ionizing radiation emissions are monitored through internal controls and evaluated 
through theoretical analyses or through direct measurements of the Electric, Magnetic, and Electromagnetic 
Fields (EMFs) emitted by all base stations, allowing the maintenance of operating licenses issued by the 
regulatory agency.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Environment 62In terms of compliance, the Group provides everyone, with the utmost guarantee of confidentiality, a single 
channel for sending or transmitting requests for clarifications or reports of alleged violations of environmental 
legislation. 
The system assigns each report submitted a unique identification code, which enables the reporter to check 
the processing status in complete anonymity1. 
As active and responsible members of the community, the Group's companies are committed to observing and 
ensuring the observance of the laws in force in the countries in which they operate and adopt the 
organizational tools needed to prevent the violation of legal provisions. 
[GRI 307-1] During 2021, no significant financial penalties were imposed on TIM in Italy for violations of 
environmental legislation in the areas in which they perform their activities. 
This consideration also applies to the previous two years.
[GRI 307-1] During 2021, TIM received one significant environmental penalty in Brazil  of 500,000 reais2. The 
penalty shown in the 2020 Sustainability Report of 500,000 reais due to failure to comply with official deeds 
issued by the environmental agency was revoked following appeal to the competent bodies. 
As part of its commercial and web operating routines, in order to provide telecommunications services, TIM 
generates electronic waste (e-waste) which are those products that have electronic circuits or components 
such as power supplies or batteries. 
Therefore, in its environmental policy and under certain rules, the Company provides the proper management 
of waste in order to comply with legislation, such as the Brazilian National Policy on Solid Waste (Law No. 
12,305/10) and Federal Law No. 10,240/20 that establish shared responsibility among generators of electronic 
waste, whether it is considered hazardous or not. This is the case for those who manufacture, import, market 
and distribute mobile phones and their batteries and accessories such as cables, chargers, headsets.
Going beyond its obligations and aiming to reduce the impact of electronic products and their damage to the 
environment and public health, TIM Brasil has established a Reverse Logistics program in partnership with an 
authorized and certified supplier, with the aim of contributing to the creation of a circular economy, i.e. 
intervening in the entire life cycle of electronics and promoting economic and social development in the 
Reverse Logistics chain through collection at TIM stores and offices.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Environment 631 Full information about this is available by clicking on this link: www.gruppotim.it/it/gruppo/governance/il-sistema/whistleblowing.html   
2 In Italy, significant financial penalties for the Group are considered to be those for an amount exceeding 500,000 euros; Brazil uses an amount of 
500,000 reais which is equivalent to 78,932 euros at the exchange rate of December 31, 2021.TIM initiatives for the environment
The concrete actions implemented by TIM in order to limit the impact of the company's activities on the 
environment are outlined below.
Energy efficiency and device recovery measures and equipment 
restoration
In 2021, TIM continued to implement a process of continuous improvement through initiatives and projects 
(renewable energy, energy efficiency, trigeneration, consumption monitoring) aimed at minimizing the 
environmental impact of the company's activities, its customers and stakeholders in general, with a view to 
limiting consumption and achieving a progressive green transition, of which energy efficiency continues to 
represent one of the most significant levers.
During the year, confirming TIM's continuous commitment to improving energy performance, purchasing 
policies mindful of environmental issues were adopted and an Energy Management System was also 
implemented, controlled and developed with reference to the ISO 50001 standard.
The COVID emergency, which continued in 2021, resulted in a reduction in consumption linked to the closure of 
the offices during the state of emergency. Energy efficiency measures, on the other hand, did not stop, with 
further compacting of plants and data centers in Italy, and the continuation of the so-called space plan 
(rational reduction of office space). In this scenario, we record an overall net reduction in YoY withdrawals of 
approximately 54 GWh.
The commitment to reducing emissions also extends to the implementation of energy monitoring and control 
solutions. In fact, during 2021 significant projects were launched, across several corporate departments, to 
monitor fixed and mobile network consumption aimed at their optimization. Special platforms have therefore 
been developed to receive data relating to the plants subject to efficiency upgrading, the monitoring of sensors 
installed on base transceiver stations during 2021 and relating to the characteristic data of trigeneration plants. 
The savings related to the monitoring project on the fixed network will be appreciable from 2022 (an estimated 
8 GWh).
Renewable energy 
TIM has continued to work to reduce emissions and energy consumption linked to the ongoing development of 
new generation networks, at the same time increasing the use of energy from renewable sources in business 
processes.
2021 sees the start of analyses aimed at identifying new business models through external partnership 
agreements, using a non-capital intensive logic. In addition to the installation of 14 photovoltaic plants, posted 
to TIM CAPEX, for a capacity of around 700 KW, which are planned to start operation in 2022, a project to build 
photovoltaic plants on medium-sized exchanges. Self-generation from renewable sources associated with that 
project will be finalized starting in 2023.
The purchase of guarantees of origin was also increased for a total purchase target in 2021 of 33% of the 
requirement of the Domestic BU, in line with an incremental coverage path that plans to reach 100% green 
coverage in 2025. Note that as of 2021, all data centers and offices in the domestic scope are fueled by 
renewable energy. As of mid-2021, the stores are now also fueled by renewable energy.
Also in 2021, TIM completed the signing of the largest Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), in terms of 
volume, concluded between two Italian counterparties. This contract for the purchase of energy from 
renewable sources for a volume of 3.4 TWh over 10 years confirms both the company's strong commitment to 
the targets of the recent Sustainability Plan and its desire to contribute to the achievement of the national 
targets for the development of renewables set by the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) for 2030. The 
Group, a leading energy consumer at national level, confirms its proactive and innovative role in the ongoing 
energy transition.
Energy efficiency of sites
In 2021, interventions have focused both on re-engineering of cooling systems for the purpose of improving 
energy performance through a further plan of Reengineering interventions (Phase 4) for the adaptation of 
infrastructures and upgrading of air conditioning systems on sites for industrial use, and on the replacement of 
obsolete CDZ fans with new «FanUTA» fans, with IE4 motor and DDMP system (direct driven magnet 
permanent). The savings associated with these projects will be appreciable from 2022 (a total of around 12 
GWh is estimated).
A series of further energy efficiency interventions (site energy management, energy stations, machine learning 
experimentation) were also carried out on 300 sites within the central and data center perimeter and a New 
Organization Project of Company Space Plan was launched with introduction of desk sharing and increase of 
Agile Work extended to Caring, which will make possible to rationalize workstations and close some offices 
with a significant reduction in energy consumption.
Trigeneration
Due to the pandemic, the authorization and deployment times of the 6 project plants have been postponed by 
approximately 12 months. In 2021 The construction of the Trigeneration plant in Bologna was completed with 
a saving of approximately 1.5 GWh in the same year. The remaining 5 plants are expected to be completed in 
IH2022 for a total installed power of 9.4 MW, with an estimated electricity saving of approximately 45 GWh/
year in 2022 and approximately 86 GWh/year when fully operational.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Environment 64Interventions for sustainable mobility
In order to encourage sustainable mobility, in 2021 TIM began in Italy the implementation of a charging 
infrastructure for electric vehicles at the company's main offices.
The project involved the installation of 76 stations at 27 locations in the cities of: Rome, Milan, Turin, Naples, 
Padua, Bologna, Palermo, Florence, Venice, Bari, Ivrea, Pomezia, Genoa, Cagliari. Currently, 40 workstations 
have been installed at the offices in Rome, Milan and Turin; the installation in Padua and Mestre is planned for 
December 2021. 
The plan to replace 25% of the vehicles used in Car Sharing with fully electric vehicles has also been initiated; 
the project involves 13 cities and a total of 50 vehicles. 
There is a sharp increase in low-emission vehicles in the fleet and in the mixed-use "Car List".
Following an initial inclusion in the Car List, due to expire on 06/30, of 51 models with Full Electric, Full Hybrid, 
Plug-in Hybrid and Mild Hybrid power supplies, there has been a significant percentage increase in the number 
of vehicles ordered that use electric power supplies, as shown below.
In order to have cars that comply with the latest European directives on pollutant gas emissions and equipped 
with increasingly advanced technologies, and for further attention on sustainability, a frequent renewal of the 
Car List is expected (every 6 months). 
In September, a Mobility Survey was submitted to the entire Tim Domestic population in order to collect the 
data necessary for the formulation of Home-Work Travel Plans (HWTP), an activity that has become 
mandatory following the publication in the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic of the Decree 05/12/2021 
regarding the "Implementation of the provisions relating to the role of the Mobility Manager". 
As confirmation of how topical the issue of mobility is, there was extraordinary participation of 79%. 
Following the results of the survey, which had a 79% participation rate, HWTPs were developed for 63 locations 
and sent to local authorities.
In addition, a tender is being launched for the remodeling of the company shuttle services for the year 2022, 
where it is planned to introduce advanced technologies such as a booking App, detection of actual use and 
travel times, and the guarantee of distancing and maximum safety. 
To encourage the use of micro-mobility, areas have been set up in the company car parks for the storage and 
recharging of bicycles and electric scooters.
Reduction of pollution
TIM has a total of 25,400 lead batteries installed at its Fixed Network locations in Italy, and their autonomies 
are set based on the type of plant.
The total weight of these batteries at the end of 2021 came to around 49,500 t, of which approximately 70% is 
comprised of lead.
Observing the quality of national electricity and the annual dynamics around the average duration of 
interruptions makes it possible for TIM to implement numerous initiatives to streamline the total number of 
batteries installed, by gradually reducing the requirements of backup. 
The improvement target is continuous (year over year) and is implemented through the review of the rules on 
calibrating the autonomies. Benefits derive from both replacements that are no longer necessary (systems 
that have decreased in efficiency due to being outdated, but still capable of guaranteeing the service required 
by the new parameters) and by replacements of systems that are no longer suitable with new, smaller 
batteries. Over time, this will gradually reduce the overall weight of lead batteries in operation while 
introducing new, less polluting technologies with greater energy density.
The total improvement expected is a reduction of around 33% in the quantity of pollutant calculated on the 
average of the installed number of batteries, net of the new solutions that TIM is testing. Using the 
replacements in the last two years as reference, the equivalent weight of lead avoided comes to around 400 t/
year.

Through its Innovation Department, TIM has also worked on the issue of smart cities for years now. In this field, 
we note several Smart Control Room projects (Venice). Inaugurated in September 2020, this “control tower” 
supported by 5G was built and is managed by TIM in collaboration with the Municipality and Local Police. It 
allows local administrations to manage services for the city in an integrated manner, including lighting, waste 
collection, mobility, and citizen and tourist safety. Data from the Control Room can be used and analyzed for 
decision-making and to intervene in real time. TIM aims to improve mobility and city safety by creating a smart 
urban model that can be extended to all Italian Municipalities. 
TIM initiates several research projects for ICT solutions in the Internet of Things (IoT), applied to the world of 
Smart Cities with a positive environmental impact. Below are some examples.
REPLICATE(Firenze Smart City) The project focuses on smart energy, smart mobility and smart waste solutions 
and the development of IoT platforms for managing the distribution of water and waste management in 
collaboration and partnership with the municipality of Florence. The project began in 2016 and was completed 
in 2021, with the field testing of the solutions developed. 
TIM Smart Roads Projects is the partner of various smart road projects, including C-ROADS 1 and 2, 
5GCARMEN, 5GSMARTG (Genova Smart Roads). With the goal of developing the Smart Roads Platform which 
enables and handles the exchange of messages and information between the IT systems of roadway 
operators, road infrastructures  (Road Side Units), vehicles (On Board Units) and the other parties that travel on 
the roads. The enabling technology is 5G, due to its low latency, and C-V2X (Cellular V2X) solutions for 
exchanging messages between vehicles via the mobile network. The use cases addressed regard scenarios of 
safe driving, assisted driving and, in future, also self-driving, addressing also cases of controlling and reducing 
consumption and, as a result, environmental emissions. Testing is conducted on real infrastructure, which 
includes, for example, the A22 Autobrennero and A4 motorways and the municipalities of Trento, Verona, 
Turin and Genoa.
Smart Agriculture. TIM is a partner of the “MIND FoodS Hub” project, along with Arexpo, the University of 
Milan, Auxologico, Agricola Moderna and various players in the field of smart, sustainable agriculture and the 
digitization of the agri-food chain, including product certification through blockchain. The project, launched in 
2020 and financed by the Lombardy Region, will conclude in 2022, and entails the use of Nb-IoT wireless 
sensors, 5G radio gateways to monitor the health and growth of several crops in order to monitor their 
nutritional parameters, also working with the agriculture departments of the university. The project involves 
the use of a robot in the greenhouse, which, using 3D sensors and multi-spectral video cameras, and 5G 
transmission and subsequent processing of the project’s data lake, conducts an accurate analysis of the 
growth process of the plants, and the archiving and historicizing of data, even for a single plantation. The 
expert agronomist can access all the data in the field in real time, also through applications and devices using 
augmented reality. The service entails a trial in the field during 2022 in a farm near Milan, in the MIND Milano 
Innovation District.
In Brazil  TIM, following a survey of agribusiness needs, identified a fully technology-driven ecosystem, but with 
significant gaps in connectivity, the main enabler of digital agriculture. In order to achieve goals such as energy 
efficiency, reduced use of chemicals, reduction of fossil fuels and water consumption, the "TIM No Campo” 
service was developed, which provides solutions to deploy 4G LTE 700MHz connectivity in rural areas 
throughout Brazil .
TIM Group Non-financial statement Environment 66Consumer Products: TIM Green 
In order to improve the environmental efficiency of products offered to private and business customers alike, 
attention has to be paid to their energy aspects, optimizing consumption while meeting the needs of the 
services delivered and applying "Design For Environment" rules that reduce their environmental impact, 
particularly during the production phase and the end-of-life management of equipment. TIM researches and 
develops products with a low environmental impact throughout their entire life cycle.
At the end of the 1990s, TIM launched a series of internal research and development activities aimed at 
creating environmentally friendly terminals known under the TIM eco-friendly logo.  
For each product and for the initiatives under this logo, information is provided on the characteristics and the 
specific solutions adopted to demonstrate eco-compatibility and environmental benefit. In the case of 
products, this information appears in the environmental statement drawn up in accordance with the UNI EN 
ISO 14021 standard, as well as in the sustainability section of the gruppotim.it website, where information can 
also be found about the "eco-friendly" features of initiatives and projects.
Today, this family of fixed telephony products falls under the TIM Green initiative and logo, which includes the 
proposal to customers of reconditioned smartphones and the new green SIM, smaller in size (half the size of 
previous SIMs) and composed of 60% recycled plastic. The packaging housing it is made of biodegradable 
material and the brochure was resized and printed on FSC paper (Forest Stewardship Council).
The TIM eco-friendly range includes dedicated products for businesses and consumers developed in 
cooperation with suppliers. The electricity savings also translate into an equivalent reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions. The entire TIM eco-friendly range of products are designed using eco-design criteria. The casing 
and packaging are made using uniform, recycled and/or recyclable materials. In 2021, TIM Hub+ was certified, a 
product of the eco-friendly line, with excellent results in environmental tests and suitably accompanied by an 
environmental declaration. 
All of TIM's products, even those not belonging to the TIM Green family, are sold in recycled cardboard 
packaging printed using soy ink. The method of disposal of each part of the product contained in the packaging 
is also state.

In 2021, the Group consumed a total of 8,493,465 GJ of energy.
Heating systems
The data show a significant reduction in 2021 compared to previous years, mainly attributable to real estate 
rationalization and the extension of agile working at home to all departments and throughout the entire 
duration of the Covid-19 emergency. In Brazil , given the particular climate conditions throughout the year, 
indoor heating is not used. Compared to 2019, consumption of energy for heating decreased in 2020 by  
126,886,235 MJ.

TIM Group Non-financial statement Environment 69Use of fuels for electricity generation 
Part of the energy required to meet TIM's needs is self-generated using trigeneration plants and generator 
sets. The latter, which are diesel-powered, guarantee not only the continuity of TIM's operations in the event of 
an interruption in the supply of electricity from the grid, but also the possibility of operating systems where 
connection to the electricity grid is not possible or in the event of special requirements or emergencies.
Trigeneration plants, on the other hand, are powered by methane and allow the use of dispersed heat to both 
heat and cool rooms. Thermal energy is converted into cooling energy by means of absorption chillers, thus 
reducing the use of conventional cooling units and the consequent consumption of electricity. At the moment 
they are only used in Italy.
The table and graph below show the consumption of fuels used for self-generation of electricity over the past 
three years.

The consumption of methane for tri-generation increased in 2021 compared to 2020 (+5%), when it had 
increased by +11% compared to the previous year, the electricity produced having increased correspondingly. 
The Group’s diesel consumption changed (-17% on 2020, -84% on 2019) in line with the reduction in properties 
occupied. In 2021, overall fuel consumption for self-generation of electricity increased slight compared to 2020 
(+5%), around the levels of consumption of 2019, with a deviation of 2 percentage points.

Total elecricity procured and produced from renewable sources2019 2020 202101,0002,0003,000[GRI 302-3]  The Group measures its energy efficiency by using an eco-efficiency indicator that establishes a 
relationship between the service offered to the customer (bits transmitted) and the company’s impact on the 
environment (joules of energy consumed). The factors taken into consideration are the amounts of data and 
voice traffic of the fixed and mobile networks, and energy consumption for industrial purposes (transmission 
and climate control in exchanges), domestic purposes (electricity for office use, air conditioning and office 
heating) and vehicles. The graphs below show the level of the eco-efficiency indicator over the past three years 
for the Domestic and Brazil BUs. The indicators calculated by the Group for Brazil and Italy are different. This is 
because the two organizations function very differently from an operational and environmental perspective: 
e.g. in Brazil the traffic is primarily mobile and, as previously mentioned, no heating fuels are used in view of 
the particular climate conditions.

compared to 2020 and 90.43% compared to 2019. This is the result of a substantial increase in data traffic, 
policies for limiting consumption and the effect of COVID-19 on these two components already in place. 
The data used in the calculation of the indicator refer only to the Group's Italian companies, i.e. Domestic, 
Sparkle Greece and Turkey are excluded from the perimeter. 
The eco-efficiency index calculated for Brazil  also continues to improve: in 2021 it significantly grew by 19.35%

[GRI 305-1] [GRI 305-2] [GRI 305-3] [GRI 305-5] [GRI 305-6]  The Group’s greenhouse gas emissions consist 
almost exclusively of carbon dioxide generated by fossil fuels for heating, transport, power generation and the 
purchase of electricity from third parties. In addition to these, fugitive emissions of hydro chlorofluorocarbons, 
hydro fluorocarbons (HCFCs and HFCs) and other gases from air conditioning and fire prevention systems are 
also considered and converted into kg of CO2 equivalent (see table Emissions of ozone depleting gases in this 
section). For atmospheric emissions as well, use is made of the GHG Protocol approach, distinguishing between 
direct or Scope 1 emissions (use of fossil fuels for transport, heating, power generation and fugitive ozone 
depleting emissions), indirect or Scope 2 emissions (purchase of electricity for industrial and civil use) and other 
indirect or Scope 3 emissions. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) emissions  [GRI 305-7]  are 
negligible in Group emissions.

per kWh (AIB, 2019) was used, while for 2019 the same source was used. For Greece and Turkey, which fall within the Domestic scope, the 2020 
Terna coefficient is used for Turkey equal to 415 gCO2/kWh, and for Greece the 2020 AIB coefficients equal to 490.4 gCO2/KWh is used. For Brazil, 
the average network factors for 2021, 2020 and 2019 calculated and published by the local Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and 
Communication were used, equal to approximately 126.41, 61.70 and 75.00 grams of CO2/kWh.
The three-year performance of direct and indirect emissions shows a positive trend thanks to policies for 
limiting consumption, energy efficiency plans and the Group's continuous investment in energy from 
renewable sources.

***  In determining the impact of home-work commuting, reference is made to statistical data produced on the company's personnel. This data 
refers to the BU Domestic.
**** Emissions due to air travel were calculated by the study and research center of American Express (the Travel Agency used by TIM) supported by 
DEFRA (Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of the United Kingdom) based on the number of journeys actually made, subdivided by 
the duration of each individual journey (short, medium or long). 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Environment 751 Greece and Turkey are excluded from the Sparkle count. Only car and motorcycle journeys by employees who do not own company cars were 
considered. Travels on public transports are excluded.[GRI 305-4]  TIM also measures the “Carbon Intensity” of its Domestic BU by using an indicator that establishes 
a relationship between the company’s direct and indirect operational CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2, 
measured in kg and generated by Company's activities), with the service offered to the customers (Tbits 
transmitted). 
The factors taken into consideration are the amount of data and voice traffic of the fixed/mobile network and 
direct emissions produced by using fossil fuels for heating, vehicles and self-production of electrical energy 
together with indirect emissions due to purchase and consumption of electrical energy from grid.

compared to 2020 and -58.70% compared to 2019. The increase in traffic combined with policies to limit 
consumption already in place at TIM are two factors that were further enhanced by the COVID-19 pandemic in 
2020.  
The data used in the calculation of the indicator refer only to the Group's Italian companies, i.e. Domestic,

The data relating to waste shows a variable trend over time in relation to quantity and type of waste. The most 
significant figure is that of the ratio of waste produced and that sent for recycling/recovery, which remains at a 
high level. ICT can accelerate the obsolescence of products and require the resulting technological waste to be 
managed. TIM has entered into contracts with companies specialized in handling used, faulty and end-of-life 
products, with the aim of reclaiming components and raw materials and at the same time obtaining tangible 
economic benefits deriving from their recovery. 
In 2021 the various management activities made it possible to regenerate commercial logistics products 
(63,026 pieces) and network materials (19,038 pieces), and to send commercial logistics products totaling 
476,528 kg for component and raw material recovery, almost exclusively for fixed telephony. 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Environment 791 The term “consigned waste” describes waste delivered to the haulier for transport to the recycling and recovery or disposal facility.
2 Slight variations compared to the situation on December 31 may occur until the following March 30, because the source of the data is the records 
of waste loaded and unloaded, which are consolidated once the actual weight at destination has been verified; The information is supplied to the 
producer of the waste within 3 months of consignment, which is the reason for the potential variations in the data. In this regard, ascertained waste 
production for 2019 was lower (-1.05%) than stated in the last Report. However, this increase was not taken into account in the 2021 on 2019 
comparison of waste produced.In 2021, the resale of used cellular phone products was carried out for a total of 16,427 pieces.
[GRI 306-3 ] Regarding underground tanks, 30 leak tests were conducted in Italy in 2021. No leaks occurred 
during the year.
In terms of equipment recovery, TIM is aware that its devices must be kept in operation as long as possible: 
their often inevitable disposal generates waste, new production and, thus, new atmospheric emissions.
The modems returned to TIM by customers due to defects or termination of contract are refurbished by a third 
party entity and reused by TIM to replace non-working equipment at customers’ homes through technical 
support. Refurbishment consists of inspecting the returned product to detect defects that make it impossible to 
recover. In that case, the product is disposed of, as the process does not entail the replacement of damaged 
plastic parts. If the product passes inspection, the modem’s functioning is checked, subsequently upgrading its 
firmware, cleaning the plastic parts, relabeling and packaging in boxes made from recycled cardboard. 
Modems that do not work but are still under the provider’s warranty are replaced. When they are no longer 
under warranty, they are sent for disposal: the process does not entail the product being opened to replace 
any damaged electronic parts. The resale of refurbished modems is not currently planned.
TIM also oversees the reuse for other functions or services of previously existing data devices (Juniper MX240) 
that would otherwise be removed or scrapped. The devices are given a new purpose, dismantling them and 
reinstalling them in different stations or locations. This recovery method also supported the urgent need to 
make wholesale sales to other operators, guaranteeing the timescales as per the SLA (Service Level 
Agreements) in relation to the potential delay of supplies of new materials.
TIM implemented a similar process of refurbishing TIM Live ultrabroadband modems, which extends their lives, 
also in Brazil . In addition, in Brazil  as part of its commercial and web operating routines, in order to provide 
telecommunications services, TIM S.A. generates electronic waste (e-waste) which are those products that 
have electronic circuits or components such as power supplies or batteries. 
Therefore, in its environmental policy and under certain rules, the Company provides the proper management 
of waste in order to comply with legislation, such as the Brazilian National Policy on Solid Waste (Law No. 
12,305/10) and Federal Law No. 10,240/20 that establish shared responsibility among generators of electronic 
waste, whether it is considered hazardous or not. This is the case for those who manufacture, import, market 
and distribute mobile phones and their batteries and accessories such as cables, chargers, headsets.
Going beyond its obligations and aiming to reduce the impact of electronic products and their damage to the 
environment and public health, TIM Brasil has established a Reverse Logistics program in partnership with an 
authorized and certified supplier, with the aim of contributing to the creation of a circular economy, i.e. 
intervening in the entire life cycle of electronics and promoting economic and social development in the 
Reverse Logistics chain through collection at TIM stores and offices. In-store disposal is made available for the 
general service of the entire population, which includes their employees, third parties, customers and non-TIM 
customers. Disposal in TIM’s buildings is intended to encourage and attract employees and other people who 
may have access to the company.
TIM has domestic post-consumption boxes for the disposal and storage of electronic products that have been 
made in line with the concept of environmental sustainability, using wood from reforestation in compliance 
with careful storage of hazardous waste, for example, using strength of materials to support the deposited 
material and guard against the leakage of any liquids.  
The disclosure is made on TIM's institutional website, through the Reload the Planet program.
A performance monitoring team shall provide the Ministry of Environment, by March 31 of each year, with the 
annual performance report, with information and data consolidated during the period from January 1 to 
December 31 of the previous year, provided by the management companies.

TIM Group Non-financial statement Environment 81Research and Development  
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  Research and development of innovative technologies and 
services, processes and business models is a fundamental factor in keeping pace with the profound 
transformations of ICT, as well as being a necessary and driving asset for customers and the countries in which 
the Group operates, contributing to overcoming the socio-cultural barriers that limit the possibility of 
participating in the information society and enjoying its benefits. The section below describes TIM’s activities in 
Italy and TIM S.A.’s activities in Brazil.
In Italy 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203] TIM has always considered innovation to be a strategic asset and 
takes great care in governing individual aspects, from its strategic role to its responsibility, objectives and 
policy.
In 2021, TIM continued to strengthen an innovation model that leverages the eco-system concept, which is 
fundamental to nurturing a virtuous circle for scouting, incubating and planning innovative initiatives. This is 
realized, on the one hand, through labs as multi-site centers open virtually and connected in a unique digital 
environment to support open innovation, and on the other hand, through collaboration with Universities of 
excellence, thus creating a synergy oriented to the digital transformation of society, and which certifies TIM as 
a reference partner in Italy.
In line with this, the Group has taken action in several ways:
■by continuing the action to strengthen internal innovation lines, focusing the activity of laboratories and 
research groups on the fundamental trends in the evolution of fixed and mobile networks towards 5G 
standards1, Open Ran and Edge Cloud, on the issues of service platforms and new operation systems;
■selecting, accelerating and co-creating innovative ideas, products and services from the world of startups2 
aand small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in line with emerging innovative trends of interest to 
TIM, in order to improve the commercial offer and internal processes, and encourage the growth of the 
Italian startup ecosystem through the TIM WCap acceleration program and venture capital investments 
made by TIM Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm3 of TIM.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  Innovation management is mainly overseen by the Innovation 
Standard&IPR and Portfolio department within the Chief Technology & Operation Office, and involves different 
stakeholders inside and outside the Company:
■other areas of the company involved from time to time, both as internal customers for the innovation 
output solution and as centers of expertise on the topic; 
■traditional and digital partners, for the joint go2market4  of digital services;
■research centers and Universities, for cooperation and joint projects . [GRI 203-1]  In 2021, research contracts 
were initiated with five Italian universities for a total value of approximately 900,000 euros;
■at international level, a vast set of standardization bodies, associations, alliances, telco open communities, 
which play a fundamental role in the evolution of the TLC industry/sector for networks, platforms and 
services, in which TIM collaborates in partnership with the main stakeholders of the sector. In 2021, despite 
the continuing international crisis due to the pandemic, TIM confirmed its membership of the main 
standardization bodies and associations with 30 registrations for a total commitment of around 800,000 
euros, placing the emphasis on interaction, not only with associations closely linked to the world of 
telecommunications, but also integrating with other industrial sectors such as the automotive sector and 
industry 4.0. Participation in international bodies has enabled TIM to increase its intellectual assets, both in 
terms of the acquisition of know-how and through direct contribution, aimed at promoting its industrial 
strategy and intellectual property (with the approval of solutions based on TIM patents in standards); 
■at national level there are numerous collaborative relationships with various Ministries, the European 
Union, Public Bodies (e.g. the National Research Council and local authorities), for the realization of 
projects financed through participation in calls for tenders and partnership initiatives. In this regard in 2021, 
the collaboration that was started in 2019 continued with the Competence Industry Manufacturing 4.0, 
aimed at fostering the transfer of technological skills and innovation in production processes, products and 
business models, as well as the collaboration with B-REX in Bologna.
TIM's technological evolution is based on its Technology Plan, part of the Business Plan; specifically the 
Technology Plan identifies the technological strategy in terms of guidelines, specific technologies and the 
roadmap of adoption over a multi-year period. The three-year technological plan is the reference policy for the 
Group and includes also the technological evolution plans of subsidiaries. The qualitative and/or quantitative 
goals have been given an annual framework. They are defined so that they can be objectively measured in 
compliance with quality standards (ISO 9001) and environmental standards (ISO 14001), and operational 
innovation processes; in the same way as TIM processes, in general, are based on Telemanagement Forum's 
reference standard E-Tom5.
[GRI 203-1]  Overall, in 2021 TIM committed around 1,300 people to working on technological innovation and 
engineering in Italy, for an overall investment for the TIM Group of 1,016 million euros.

Cloud and Open RAN
In 2021 TIM continued its commitment to innovative activities with a focus on 5G, Edge Cloud and Open Ran. 
Open-RAN and Edge Computing technologies are considered decisive to allow 5G to fulfill its technological and 
business potential. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is a concept based on the interoperability and 
standardization of the elements of the 4G and 5G radio access network, including a unified interconnection 
standard for open source hardware and software elements from different vendors, and the introduction of 
network elements that enable more intelligence in the network according to the principles of Artificial 
Intelligence and Machine Learning. Edge Computing moves traffic and service processing from a centralized 
cloud to the edge of the network and closer to the customer, allowing full advantage to be taken of high speed 
and low latency on the network.
TIM, a member of the O-RAN ALLIANCE since 2018, during the first half of 2021 was one of Europe’s first 
operators (and the only one in Italy) to launch an Open RAN (Open Radio Access Network) development 
program for the innovation of the mobile access network. This initiative will see the Group implement new 
solutions on its commercial network to benefit customers and businesses thereby speeding up the deployment 
of digital services.
The initiative is covered by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in February 2021 with the main 
European operators to promote Open RAN technology with the aim of speeding up the implementation of new 
generation mobile networks, in particular 5G, Cloud and Edge Computing.
In this context, TIM has launched a series of field trials and laboratory tests:
The first trial, launched in April 2021, sees Faenza as the first city in Italy to adopt this open network model, 
where, thanks to the collaboration with JMA Wireless, a leader in mobile coverage activities and in the 
development of Open RAN software, TIM uses a solution that decouples the components (hardware and 
software) of the radio access network, according to a logic of supplier diversification, with a view to fostering a 
broader industrial ecosystem. In this case, the radio node, on a 4G network, was built by combining the JMA 
software baseband with the radio units supplied by Microelectronics Technology (MTI). Looking ahead, this 
activity will also extend to 5G solutions.
In October, the solution was also activated in Saluzzo, in the province of Cuneo, thus creating some of the most 
extensive Open RAN coverage in Europe.
In September, a solution that follows the architecture and interfaces defined in O-RAN was also activated in 
Matera, thanks to the collaboration with Mavenir for the RAN components and with MTI for the 4G Radio Unit. 
This solution, also developed with Dell Technologies, Intel and VMware, makes it possible to decouple the 
components (hardware and software) of the radio access network, according to a logic of supplier 
diversification, with a view to fostering a broader industrial ecosystem. 
In addition, the first stand alone Open RAN 5G connection (i.e. completely independent from 4G) was carried 
out at the TIM Innovation Lab in Turin and will soon be activated also in the field in Matera. The result was 
achieved on the 3.7 GHz frequencies of TIM's 5G network in collaboration with Mavenir for core and radio 
networking capabilities, Dell Technologies and Intel for infrastructure, and VMware's Telco Cloud platform for 
end-to-end control of network functions and software automation.
The development of Open RAN solutions, characterized by an open environment, allows, in line with the 
objectives of TIM's 2021-2023 plan, to combine the potential of the cloud and Artificial Intelligence with the 
evolution of the mobile network. This technology allows operators to reinforce security standards, improve 
network performance and optimize costs in order to provide increasingly advanced digital services, such as 
those related to new solutions for Industry 4.0, Smart City and autonomous driving.
TIM is also one of the world’s first operators (and the only one in Italy) to launch the “European OTIC Lab.” The 
Open Test and Integration Center - OTIC Lab, in line with the standards envisaged by O-RAN ALLIANCE, the 
set-up of which will be completed during the second half of the year, will be based at the TIM Group Innovation 
laboratories in Turin and operate in synergy with the entire Open RAN ecosystem (manufacturers, start-ups, 
system integrators, etc.) in order to try out new solutions and speed up this technology for the development of 
the new pan-European architecture of the mobile network (5G, Cloud and Edge Computing).
As part of the activities carried out in TIM's OTIC laboratory, during the months of October and November TIM 
hosted the third edition of the Plugfest. The focus of the plugfest was the verification of compliance and 
interoperability of some interfaces defined in O-RAN and the end2end performance testing of some solutions 
implemented according to the specifications defined within the scope of O-RAN.
Other partnerships and activities with a focus on 5G 
The Torino City Lab initiative continues6 : TIM's contribution in 2021 focused mainly on the activities of the Turin 
Casa delle Tecnologie7. The City of Turin is in fact first in the rankings of the tender of Axis 1 of the Program in 
support of emerging technologies and the four-year project presented, known as CTE Next (in which TIM is the 
reference technological partner), has been awarded the MISE (Ministry of Economic Development) loan.
Over the 4 years, many Torino City Lab initiatives will be conducted through CTE Next, which provides a series 
of calls for testing and calls for innovation, for which it will catalyze the potential experiments by start-ups and 
SMEs interested in carrying out activities in the territory of Turin. The project reference verticals are the classic 
sectors on which the city of Turin focuses: Smart Mobility, Urban Air Mobility (drones), Industry 4.0, Innovative 
Urban Services, and the gaze, as always, will be turned towards the social aspects and potential replication in 
other contexts of the solutions tested. In addition to the locations for experimentation already used in Torino 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 846 Torino City Lab: project started in 2019 and born from the partnership between TIM and the Municipality of Turin. In particular, TIM is a TLC partner, 
for the establishment of simplified trial areas for digital services to allow for strategic collaboration to continue in the dissemination phase of the 
commercial 5G service.  
7 Casa delle tecnologie : project inaugurated in July 2021 from which the House of Emerging Technologies was born, which aims to characterize the 
city as a large open innovation center to attract projects in the field of solutions for Smart Cities and Smart Mobility. City Lab (Doralab and the urban circuit of Smart Roads), the CSI Next site, the CIM 4.0, the Clik laboratories of 
the Polytechnic and the laboratories of the Links Foundation (all places where TIM has set up the 5G reference 
infrastructure) will be added.
Thanks to CTE Next, the activities of Torino City Lab are significantly expanded, and made more structured and 
formalized, ensuring better effectiveness for the sustainable development of the territory. It should be pointed 
out that in CTE Next, TIM represents the 360-degree technological reference point for both the construction of 
the Casa delle Tecnologie and the innovation activities that will be carried out in it, assuming an even more 
central and decisive role for the success of the initiative.
A further collaboration with the Municipality of Turin concerns the automotive trial in the context of the 5GAA 
(5G Automotive Association), which also sees the participation of other mobile operators (British Telecom and 
Telefonica), Cisco, Intel, Capgemini and Harman as technology providers, and Stellantis as car maker. The goal 
is to ensure greater livability of city streets, increasing the safety of all road users (pedestrians, cyclists, 
motorists), with the testing of Vulnerable Road User (VRU) and Intersection Movement Assist (IMA) use cases, 
which are based on TIM's 5G network and Edge Computing solutions, the same technological assets that are 
characteristic of CTE Next. These activities concluded in December, with a demo conducted on private roads 
with a commercial 5G Network, the service scenarios were successfully demonstrated, specifically applied to 
foreign users of British Telecom and Telefonica roaming on the TIM network.
The involvement in this initiative of 5T, the in-house company of the Municipality that manages mobility 
systems and services in Turin and Piedmont, guarantees that the solutions designed and demonstrated in the 
tests are consistent and can be integrated with the development of the traffic management platforms used in 
Turin. From this perspective, TIM and the other partners of the project are deciding whether to execute the 
second phase in 2022, involving the trial of this type of application scenario under real traffic conditions (or at 
least under controlled traffic conditions in real scenarios).
In the automotive sector , among the main applications, agreements and use scenarios of TIM's 5G 
implemented in 2021, we highlight:
■The C-ROADS Italy project, in which TIM participates as an enabler of the infrastructure dedicated to hybrid 
communication, i.e. based on the interaction between cellular and proximity communication. TIM has 
collaborated with project partners, in particular Autostrada del Brennero and Centro Ricerche Fiat 
(Stellantis) for the implementation of pilot projects in the field. To this end, TIM ensured mobile coverage 
on all stretches of the Brenner Highway and developed and made available for experimentation the 
Interchange Entity, i.e. the application component of the C-ROADS platform that enables the exchange of 
messages between all operators in the smart transport ecosystem world, such as highways and the 
connected car. 
■The MASA project - Modena Automotive Smart Area, an 'open-air' laboratory for the testing and 
certification of new technologies in autonomous driving, assisted driving and mobility, born from the 
partnership between the Municipality of Modena and the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. The 
collaboration will make it possible to test increasingly advanced autonomous and connected driving 
solutions and services, with the aim of developing the communication infrastructure that will be the basis 
of the new mobility services using the potential offered by the most modern network technologies.  In 
particular, TIM will provide innovative solutions enabled by its 4G and 5G mobile radio networks, as well as 
by Edge Computing technologies, which ensure better performance in terms of high bandwidth and low 
latency, for automotive applications related to mobility and traffic management.
■The agreement with ALIS for smart and sustainable mobility through the digitization of over 1,500 
transport, logistics and intermodal companies. The aim is to make the mobility of goods and people 
smarter and more efficient, as well as greener, thanks to digital technologies generating a positive impact 
in terms of economic, social and environmental sustainability in the transport, logistics and intermodal 
supply chain.
■"Arena del Futuro" - the world's first collaborative innovation project for zero-emission mobility of people 
and goods towards carbon neutrality together with the A35 Brebemi-Aleatica highway, ABB, Electreon, 
FIAMM Energy Technology, IVECO, IVECO Bus, Mapei, Pizzarotti, Polytechnic of Milan, Prysmian, Stellantis, 
Roma Tre University and University of Parma. The collaboration is aimed at creating the conditions for the 
development of an innovative zero-emission mobility system for people and goods along highway 
transport corridors by demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of technologies related to the 
powering of electric cars, buses and commercial vehicles through dynamic non-contact inductive charging. 
■In December 2021, TIM presented the Autonom Shuttle by Navya, a 100%-electric, self-driving shuttle that 
interfaces with the 5G network and Smart Mobility and Smart City platforms. This is the Autonom Shuttle 
developed by Navya, a French company that is a leader in the self-driving vehicle sector, dedicated to the 
first and last miles, tested at the TIM Innovation Lab in Rome. The 100%-electric, self-driving mini bus is 
capable of dialoging, through the 5G network, with the apps on TIM’s Smart Mobility and Smart City 
platforms, to ensure safety. The self-driving electric shuttle can transport up to 15 passengers (11 seated 
and 4 standing). It reaches a maximum speed limited to 25 km/h, using an electric engine of nominal 22.6 
kW (peak of 34). The possible evolutions of the technology implemented by the shuttle include performing 
surveillance services. 
In the Industry 4.0 sector , collaborations can be pointed to with top-level Competence Centers such as CIM 4.0 
and B-REX.
Within Competence Industry Manufacturing 4.0 (CIM 4.0) of the Ministry of Economic Development 
Competence Center, TIM Innovation Labs collaborate with the Polytechnic University and University of Turin, as 
well as with 23 other companies from Turin for the study, testing and dissemination in SMEs of Industry 4.0 
solutions, including 5G. The collaboration that began in 2019 continued into 2021, not only on the higher 
education front with active participation in the CIM Academy, but also on the technology front: TIM has 
brought ultra-fast XGS-PON connections to CIM: FTTH fiber connections with XGS-PON technology, which 
make a bandwidth of 10 GB/second available symmetrically, and the use of new Edge Cloud infrastructure, 
technological enablers designed ad hoc to foster the best digital performance and greatest flexibility of use. 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 85At BI-REX, Bologna center, the focus placed on the development areas of Big Data, Additive Manufacturing, 
Robotics, finishing and metrology, the alliance between the TIM network and the technologies present in BI-
REX’s pilot line, a reference point already active for companies, research centers and SMEs throughout Italy, 
engaged in the processes of technology transfer and digital transformation, demonstrates an example of how 
5G could accelerate the digitization of companies. 
On BI-REX’s pilot line, TIM has made a professional push-to-talk communication platform available to ensure 
greater safety for working staff on the move. This platform allows you to geolocate and follow the worker, 
ensuring adequate protection even when isolated, thanks to the activation of the "man down" feature, which 
detects any irregularities in the worker's posture, enabling on-site supervision.
TIM's new fifth-generation network, integrated with the Augmented and Virtual Reality solutions already 
present on the pilot line, will enable timely future maintenance activities, with remote technical assistance, 
thanks to constant monitoring of the operation and the alarm indicators of the connected systems, minimizing 
any downtime and costs.
Collaboration between TIM and BI-REX is also concerned with the sphere of training, aimed at updating the 
skills of people and companies at the center of change: the online training activities on technologies for 
Industry 4.0 of the TIM Corporate Academy, will in fact complement the educational offer already provided by 
BI-REX, both on site with the pilot line itself, and remotely.
In May, under the scope of the agreement between TIM and Google Cloud, stipulated in 2020, for a 
technological collaboration for the creation of innovative public, private and hybrid cloud services to enrich the 
range of technological services offered by TIM, TIM and Noovle have launched the development of Italy's first 
“5G Cloud Network”. The solution will allow for the faster development of new digital applications in 5G, thanks 
to the automation of industrial processes and the real time implementation of services thanks to EDGE 
Computing, on the basis of specific needs. The project, which will enable the automation of the functions of 
TIM’s 5G core network and all Cloud applications, will use the TIM Telco Cloud infrastructure, Google Cloud 
solutions and Ericsson technologies.
Among the initiatives in the entertainment  field, a sector over which TIM's innovation presides through all of 
its components, and in support of TIM's large commitment on the commercial front, the 5G-TOURS European 
project is of importance, whose various uses include use of the 5G network in remote and distributed TV 
production and where TIM participates as site manager in Turin. In that context, in November the first test of 
the “itinerant orchestra” was held at Palazzo Madama: over 100 spectators at the Gran Salone dei Ricevimenti 
enjoyed the musical work “The Garden of Forking Paths” by Andrea Molino, in which a group of musicians and 
actors moving through the streets of downtown Turin played in harmony with an instrumental ensemble 
located in the theater, despite the performers’ physical distance from each other. This was all made possible 
due to TIM’s 5G network, which guaranteed steady high speeds with extremely low latency, to ensure the 
contemporary broadcast of numerous high definition video streams from the video cameras to the control 
center.
Service Innovation Initiatives
Operating activities to develop 5G technology, Open RAN and Edge Computing, as well as the enhancement of 
innovative solutions linked to Quantum Communication, Metamaterials, the Corporate Technology Plan and 
Digital Services carried out in partnership with companies, institutions, universities and start-ups, most of 
which are part of TIM's Open Innovation ecosystem, are accompanied by structured technical communication 
activities that range from the TIM Technical Bulletin editorial plan, to promotions with press releases and 
events to disseminate scientific information, also at the customer's premises. 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  Research with universities  
In 2021, participatory research and development activities have been strongly focused on a model that ensures 
an eco-system vision that pursues Open Innovation also through collaboration with some Universities of 
excellence. In fact, in 2021 TIM will focus on the creation of a real "Open Innovation Ecosystem" centered on 
the collaboration with Italian Universities in order to develop new Open Lab and Research Projects, as well as 
through PhD contribution to internalize specialized knowledge, but also for the sharing of technological trends, 
heralding new growth opportunities within an increasingly global market.
Open Innovation therefore grafts into an integrated ecosystem with the strategic European and Italian 
departments comprising orders, PhDs, PoCs, the development of demo prototypes, Community Open Source, 
financed projects and dissemination.
The research with the Universities for Innovation of 2021 identifies specific topics; real structured courses on 
some medium/long-term topics to complete and enrich the internal know-how and construct an all-round 
overview:
■setting medium-term paths and collaborations;
■continuity with the Framework Agreements of the previous year with 4 universities (Turin Polytechnic, 
University of Catania, Secondary School Sant’Anna of Pisa and the NRC);
■launch of an agreement with the University of Bologna on 5G for Industry with the corresponding 
framework agreement on possible architectures that allow the integration of the 5G network within an 
industrial plant. This will be based on the specific requirements determined by the different use cases of 
Industry 4.0 and communication protocols used for industrial automation based on the evolution of the 
features offered by the 5G network for Industrial IoT in the various releases of the standard. TIM, which 
employs approximately 60 TIM reference technicians, 65 university researchers involved in specific 
activities, envisages an economic commitment for 2021 of around 900,000 euros.
Another important step in the support for research and innovation is the path undertaken by TIM with the 
financing of 30 PhDs. In particular, the Innovation department has provided the Human Resources department 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 86with technical collaboration to propose research topics for establishing and tutoring 9-10 scholarships for the 
36th cycle and 6 additional scholarships for the 37th cycle. The universities chosen are: the Polytechnic of Turin, 
the Polytechnic of Milan, the University of Milan, the University of Trento, the Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna of 
Pisa, the Federico II University of Naples, the University of Catania and the Alma Mater Studiorum of Bologna.
The partnership between the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and the Municipality of Modena for the 
testing and certification of new self-driving technologies and assisted driving that is part of the MASA – 
Modena Automotive Smart Area project was activated, where TIM implements 4G/5G mobile radio and Edge 
Computing solutions.
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  Funded research activity
In 2021, TIM continued to be active in participating in innovation and research initiatives funded by the 
European Union and national public authorities, taking part, in particular, in international projects on issues 
that are key for TIM. In the four-year period between 2018 and 2021, in the European research and innovation 
programs (such as Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020 and its recent evolution Horizon Europe) TIM 
participated in more than 50 project proposals of which more than a third were accepted and then funded for 
about 16 million euros. In this context, the activities carried out in the projects funded on the topics of 5G, 
virtualization and smart mobility services, and more recently "Beyond 5G", which will lead to the definition of 
the new generation of mobile systems of the near future, are those that have allowed, on the one hand, the 
enrichment of expertise and, on the other hand, the acquisition and consolidation of an internationally-
recognized role.
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  Patents and Intellectual Property Rights8
In 2021, the Group's patent portfolio maintained a size comparable to that of previous years. The production of 
new patent applications remained in line with previous years (16 patent applications filed on new inventions) 
as did the new patents granted during the year. The rationalization of the patent portfolio has led to some 
patents being abandoned which, with technological evolution, are no longer of any value. The Group's patent 
areas relate to the entire ICT sector, with specific excellence in the mobile sector, in particular in radio access, 
where TIM is among the leading TLC operators in the world. 
In detail, TIM’s patent portfolio at the end of 2021, relating to 538 patented inventions, includes over 3,000 
inventions, both patent applications and patents granted: the latter (granted following examination by over 35 
national patent offices) account for around 90% of the total.
A significant aspect of patent activity is represented by the high number of patents resulting from collaboration 
with universities and research institutes: 13% of patented inventions are the result of such collaborations.
Also noteworthy is the participation in several patent pools9 managed by Via Licensing and Avanci on 3G, 4G 
and 5G, with three patented inventions that were found to be essential to the standards. The patent pools 
acquired new participants during the year (with a current total of 29 licensees for Via Licensing's LTE patent 
pool and 48 licensees for the Avanci 3G 4G automotive patent pool) and granted licenses to 56 companies (Via 
Licensing's LTE patent pool) and 19 car brands (Avanci's 3G+4G automotive patent pool), respectively. 
TIM has equipped itself with a policy that envisages a recognition for patents when first granted and for those 
that have led to an economic return. The inventors are assigned a reward that takes into account the 
importance of the patents, assessed by an internal committee.

The Architecture & Innovation Technology department10 is responsible for Research and Development (R&D) 
activities; its main tasks are to define technological innovation for the network and information technology, to 
identify evolutionary needs for new technologies and devices, converging architectonic guidelines and strategic 
alliances in order to use the new business models and guarantee that the network infrastructure evolution is in 
line with the corporate strategy. 
In 2021, the Architecture & Innovation Technology department was made up of 52 people, including 
telecommunications, electrical and electronic, IT engineers and other specialists with professional skills and 
experience, which cover all areas of network knowledge, meeting the need to innovate and support research 
and development activities.
TIM Lab is the multifunction environment focused on innovation, which also plays a strategic role in supporting 
credibility tests and trials, as well as PoCs (proofs of concepts), collaborating with the main suppliers and 
technology partners through knowledge sharing, technological infrastructure for interoperability tests, staff 
assessment and the definition of technical requirements; in synergy with the R&D department, it facilitates 
innovation activities and promotes collaborations with universities and research institutes.

■next generation network;
■with positive impact on the environment and society;
■future Internet applications;
■Open Lab Initiatives.
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 203] Next generation network projects 
The reassignment of the 1,800 MHz, 850 MHz and 2,100 MHz bands from 2G/3G to 4G, with a multilayer 
distribution configuration gives TIM S.A. three important competitive advantages:
■a reduction in costs for the LTE implementation12;
■the extension of the LTE coverage area and the activation of the carrier aggregation strategy, improving 
the customer experience through a higher throughput;
■the best indoor coverage. In addition to the expansion of coverage, use of the 850/1,800/2,100 MHz 
bandwidths could increase the capacity in cities already covered by the LTE bandwidth at 2.6 GHz, at 
limited additional cost.
In this scenario, over 99% of current LTE terminals are compatible with the 1,800 MHz, 2,600 MHz bands and 
other available bands. Therefore, the implementation of the multilayer LTE continues to be an excellent 
strategy that benefits from the spread of devices.
The implementation of the 700 MHz LTE layer has continued to significantly improve coverage expansion and 
indoor penetration, promoting the presence of LTE on a national level and consolidating TIM S.A.’s leadership 
in LTE. 89% of TIM S.A.' current user base of LTE devices is 700 MHz enabled (December 2021). 
At the end of December 2021, 3,900 cities had 700 MHz LTE coverage, namely over 93% of the urban 
population; spectrum cleaning was completed in June 2019 in all cities of Brazil, enabling a bandwidth of 700 
MHz. At end 2022, the total number of cities covered by TIM S.A. with a 700 MHz bandwidth should be 4,100, as 
envisaged by the Business Plan.
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 203] Projects entailing a reduction of energy consumption 
The expansion of "RAN Sharing 4G", in partnership with other mobile operators in Brazil, aims to define the 
architectural requirements, technical assumptions and specifications for the "LTE RAN sharing13" solution, 
optimizing network resources and costs14. At present, this is the largest agreement for RAN sharing worldwide 
and it supplies 5G services to the main cities of Brazil.
The RAN sharing agreement allows TIM S.A. to promote the evolution of the spread of LTE in the Brazilian 
campaign, effectively sharing access and backhau15l. Currently, 4G RAN Sharing is based on three national 
partners, expanding the benefits and efficiency of this technical model. The energy consumption recorded for 
the site, dependent on the access technology and coverage conditions, showed a reduction of up to 10%.
In December 2019, TIM S.A. and Telefónica stipulated new sharing contracts aimed at increasing the network 
cost efficiency through the following initiatives:
■Single network: sharing of the 3G and 4G networks in cities with fewer than 30 thousand inhabitants in 
which both operators provide their services. The underlying idea is to have, in the cities included in the 
agreement, a single telecommunications infrastructure that is entirely shared by the operators, thereby 
allowing them to switch off redundant sites and save on energy, rent and maintenance costs. This also 
allows for greater efficiency in future investments thanks to the sharing of the spectrum in MOCN mode.
■Switching off of the 2G: nationwide sharing of the 2G network using GWCN technology, enabling both 
operators to switch off part (approximately 50%) of their network with the same technology, consequently 
saving on energy and maintenance costs.

Internet of Things - It was back in 2018 that TIM S.A. launched the very first commercial NB-IoT16 network in 
South America, to develop innovative services, aware that the mass introduction of the IoT can change the 
mobile telephony market considerably, because it leverages the creation of services and - amongst others - is a 
potential tool for agricultural uses, the connection of cars, traceability solutions and social-health care. In 2020, 
access to the NB-IoT network was extended.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 8812 Long Term Evolution.
13 Sharing the “Radio Access Network.”
14 The costs of the infrastructures are mainly linked to the introduction of new radiating systems and that of other electronic components, passive 
site infrastructures and transport networks; therefore, the sharing of resources provided by LTE RAN represents a significant optimization of costs 
for telecommunications operators.
15  In the telecommunications sector, a backhaul network or return network is the portion of a hierarchical network that includes intermediate 
connections between the core network (or backbone network) and the small sub-networks at the "margins" of the same hierarchical network.
16 Narrowband Internet of Things  (NB-IoT) is a standard LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) radio technology developed by the 3GPP for 
communication to a wide range of mobile devices and services.Agrobusiness - since 2018, together with Nokia and BR Digital, TIM S.A. has been focusing on agro-food 
potential in Brazil, offering connections in rural areas (not only for business applications but also for the digital 
inclusion of agrobusiness employees and residents of small towns). In 2020, TIM strengthened its position in 
relation to vertical agriculture17, with the creation of the ConnectarAgro ecosystem (conectaragro.com.br) 
which brings together TIM S.A., solution providers for the agro segment and telecommunication solution 
providers.
5G - Commercial launch in 2020 involving the following towns: Bento Gonçalves (RS), Itajubá (MG) and Três 
Lagoas (MS). The technology will be used to supply wireless residential broadband with FWA (Fixed Wireless 
Access) technology, exploiting the old frequencies of the 2G, 3G and 4G networks through dynamic spectrum 
sharing (DSS).

TIM S.A. joined the Telecom Infra Project (TIP) in 2017, an initiative founded by Facebook, SK Telecom, 
Deutsche Telekom, Nokia, Intel and other companies, which aims to create a new approach to building and 
implementing the telecommunications network infrastructure. TIM S.A. transformed TIM Lab into the first TIP 
Community Lab in Latin America, available to TIP members to create universal standards for solutions (initially 
transport networks, Open Optical Packet Transport working group), to overcome the challenges related to 
interoperability of different supplier products. 
In 2018, TIM S.A. also joined a new working group within the TIP, together with Vodafone and Telefonica, called 
DCSG (Disaggregated Cell Site Gateway18). This project is an opportunity to define a common set of operator 
requirements and coordinate with companies that manufacture devices, which have wider and more flexible 
capacities and are cheaper; in June this year, the main functions of the solution were demonstrated with the 
help of Facebook, core EDGE suppliers and TIP members.
Finally, in 2020, TIM S.A. and the TIP partners completed their validation of the TSS (Total Site Solution), an 
inexpensive, unrestricted 4G NodeB solution, powered by solar energy and connected by satellite to the core 
TIM S.A. network, to be used in remote zones with low population density. During the year, TIM also adhered to

frequencies in Italy by the Ministry of Economic Development (available up to 2037), as a result of the tender 
concluded at the end of 20183.
TIM's mobile 5G network has been recognized as Europe's fastest download network by Opensignal, the 
independent global standard for measuring the user experience of mobile networks. TIM customers, in fact, 
have reached an average download speed of 296.5 Mbps. TIM has also entered the world’s top 30 for having 
enabled an improvement in the switch from the 4G to the 5G network in terms of download and upload 
speeds in the spread of videos and gaming experience4.  In July 2021, Ookla®, a world-leading fixed and mobile 
network measurement and analysis company, assessed TIM’s 5G network as the fastest in Italy for the period 
April - June 2021. 
This new technology goes beyond a simple evolution of 4G performance, aiming to create an entire innovative 
network and service platform capable of meeting the future demands of digital society5.
5G is the new telecommunications paradigm that will bring about a radical evolution of the fixed and mobile 
network , with performance ten times higher than current technology in terms of connection speed and 
reliability, in order to:
■support the country’s digitization;
■relaunch the competitiveness of the industries;
■improve our way of communicating and living.
The previous generations of mobile networks were designed to offer telecommunications services and improve 
just one aspect of the previous generation:
■2G introduced mobile telephone portability for voice communication and messages,
■3G introduced data transmission while on the move,
■the focus of 4G was high data speed.
5G will also enable services that revolutionize everyday life, turning cities into smart systems, benefiting key 
sectors of our economy such as industry, automotive, health, education, tourism, entertainment and security.
5G will have clear advantages for: 
■consumers, thanks to a wide range of innovative services dedicated to the Internet of Things, or in 
entertainment, where this technology will provide a real immersive 3D experience;
■businesses, because the performance of the new production processes will be increased by artificial 
intelligence, cloud computing6 and smart robotics7; 
■citizens, because smart cities will become a reality thanks to the availability of data provided by millions of 
sensors attached to objects (e.g. lampposts, traffic lights, etc.) connected to the network. Each town will 
have its own Control Room8.

Interconnecting, exchanging data and remotely managing industrial systems, with the guarantee of 
greater efficiency, reliability and security and significantly improving the production cycle. The use of a 
dedicated 5G private network achieves the objectives of very low latency and good data security required 
by production companies. In 2021, TIM: 
•connected the first factory to 5G in May, working with EXOR International, a manufacturer of digital 
platforms for the industrial sector, specializing in Industrial IoT and Edge Computing14 solutions. In 
Verona the first Italian smart factory, connected via TIM’s private 5G network15 optimizes the 
innovative Industry 4.0 solutions, using the extremely low latency and high level of security and 
reliability that characterize the dedicated internal coverage;
•continued the collaboration with COMAU (begun in December 2020) for the digital transformation of 
manufacturing companies, to accelerate IoT technologies and innovative solutions for businesses, 
leveraging the potential of 5G and Olivetti artificial intelligence - the digital farm of the TIM Group, 
which makes available the specialized expertise matured in the IoT field, guaranteeing support and 
technical assistance in all phases, from remote to on-site.
5G technology implementation must be done in compliance with energy efficiency constraints (measured in 
bit/Joule) since, according to the ITU IMT-Vision recommendation (M.2083), energy consumption of the new 
system must be appropriately monitored and “not greater” than that of existing networks. TIM controls total 
consumption through suitable modernization of 2G-3G systems; for example, hardware modernization on a 
base transceiver station, with the same configuration, gains approximately 20% in terms of electricity 
consumption with respect to the 2G-3G systems. The modernization is proposed as part of the development 
plan, according to a given strategy and is based on the use of new, multi-standard hardware, simplification 
and positioning - mainly externally - of the hardware, with benefits that also impact the air conditioning costs

transceiver stations.
To support the development of 5G services, TIM is investing in Open RAN (Open Radio Access Network)16 and 
Edge Cloud technologies.
In 2021, the TIM Group’s program to develop Open RAN solutions on its mobile network continued in Matera 
and Turin, with the goal of accelerating the development of 5G and Edge Computing digital services through 
new centralized and cloud services to benefit individuals and businesses. Specifically, following the launch in 
Faenza,  the first town where TIM launched the Open RAN technology, the solution was also activated in 
Matera, due to the collaboration with Mavenir for the RAN components and MTI for the 4G radio units. This 
solution, also developed with Dell Technologies, Intel and VMware, makes it possible to decouple the 
components (hardware and software) of the radio access network, according to a logic of supplier 
diversification, with a view to fostering a broader industrial ecosystem. In addition, the first stand alone Open 
RAN 5G connection (i.e. completely independent from 4G) was carried out at the TIM Innovation Lab in Turin 
and will soon be activated also in the field in Matera. 
In June 2021, working with Noovle, the TIM Group's cloud company, TIM kicked off the construction of the first 
5G Cloud network in Italy, which will speed up the creation of 5G digital applications, thanks to the automation 
of industrial processes and the development of services in real time due to EDGE Computing. The project will 
make use of TIM's Telco Cloud infrastructure, Google's Cloud solutions and Ericsson 5G Core Network and 
Automation technologies and will allow companies to offer innovative integrated solutions that can improve 
the efficiency of logistics and production processes. Thanks to the ‘5G Cloud Network’ companies that intend to 
adopt 5G services and connectivity will be able to use the ultrabroadband radio network (RAN) without 
needing to build the physical infrastructure of the core network at their logistics or production sites. 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203-1] [GRI 203-2]  TIM’s ultra-broadband network   
Starting from 2012, TIM has been developing its ultra-broadband network17with the aim of bringing high speed 
connectivity services with optical fiber to most of the Italian territory and contribute to the economic growth of 
the country. TIM chose to implement two different NGAN network architectures for the supply of high speed 
services with optical fiber:
■FTTC (Fiber To The Cabinet) architecture. The fiber optic cables leave the exchange and go to the street 
cabinet, where an active device is installed (ONU) that transfers data traffic on twisted double copper 
cables to reach the modem/routers at the customer’s site. Thanks to eVDSL18 technology, the FTTC 
network can reach speeds of 200 Mbps, and, with further technological evolution, it can reach up to 300 
Mbps;
■FTTH (Fiber To The Home) architecture. The fiber optic cables leave the exchange and arrive directly inside 
apartments (through the so-called “vertical”). At the customer site, an active device is installed (ONT) that 
transfers data traffic from the fiber optics to the modem/routers. The FTTH network technology 
GPON19can reach speeds of one gigabit per second and is developed in areas already covered by FTTC 
technology, so as to ensure to customers choice in terms of connection speed.
At the end of 2021, the TIM Group, with around 20.7 million kilometers of fiber laid across the country, reached 
around 5,700 Italian municipalities with ultrabroadband services for the benefit of individuals, businesses and 
the public administration. Ultrabroadband coverage is currently provided for 94% of households using the fixed 
network, while on the 4G mobile network over 99% of the population are served.
Thanks to the major investment program undertaken in the last two years, Puglia and Friuli-Venezia Giulia 
have become the first regions in which TIM has bridged the digital divide. The Company is continuing with its 
plan to extend fiber to bridge the digital divide across the country.
In July 2021 TIM made it possible for customers and other (wholesale) operators to test the ultrabroadband 
service on FTTH optical fiber with speeds of up to 10 Gigabits20 per second, using XGS-PON network 
technology. This technology enables connections at speeds of up to 10 Gbps (gigabits per second) for 
download (from the network to the customer) and up to 2Gbps for upload (from the customer to the network), 
higher than the current speeds of 1Gbps for download and up to 300Mbps for upload (Executive offer) or up to 
2.5 Gbps for download and 1Gbps for upload (Premium offer activate from February 4, 2022).
The XGS-PON standard is currently being tested in 11 cities (Milan, Turin, Trento, Trieste, Bologna, Florence, 
Rome, Naples, Cagliari, Taranto and Brindisi), and coverage is expected to be extended from 2022 onwards, 
opening up the commercial offering, beginning with the main Italian cities.
In September 2021, in Turin, TIM was the first in Italy to test FTTH fiber at 25 Gigabits per second, a download 
speed of up to 25 Gbps, equal to 10 times the speed of GPON FTTH and 2.5 times that of XGSPON FTTH. A new 
first, which joins that previously achieved with FTTH up to 10 Gigabits per second, confirming that the 
Company is the leader in innovation and the development of new generation services and networks.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 9316 Telecommunications operators (including TIM) and technology providers, among others, participated in this initiative to “open" the radio access 
network to the possibility to use different types of equipment for the various functional blocks, that can operate with each other through a set of

■transfer of the secondary network of TIM;
■transfer of the equity investment of Fastweb in Flash Fiber;
■merger of Flash Fiber, backdating the accounting and tax effects to January 1, 2021, which resulted in the 
contribution of the fiber optic network previously developed in 29 cities;
■purchase by Teemo Bidco Sarl (a subsidiary of KKR Infrastructure) of 37.5% of FiberCop from TIM.
Following these transactions, the share capital of FiberCop S.p.A. broke down as follows at December 31, 2021:
■TIM S.p.A. 58%;
■Teemo Bidco Sarl 37.5%;
■Fastweb S.p.A. 4.5%.
The road cabinets used for the copper network remain within the scope of TIM; the optical cabinets used for 
the secondary fiber network flow into the scope of FiberCop. 
FiberCop’s “mission” focuses on the following aspects:
■to exclusively operate in the wholesale market for the provision of passive services related to the 
secondary fiber and copper network until it is completely switched off;
■to deploy the FTTH access network nationwide in 2,580 cities and towns, i.e. over 60% of Italy’s population 
by 2026;
■to extend co-investment to 2,549 municipalities of the FTTH coverage plan, which already envisages 
engaging other operators (Fastweb, Tiscali), opening it up to all interested operators even in more limited 
geographical areas, with the option to join also at a later stage. In particular, during 2021, FiberCop signed 
coinvestment agreements with the operators Iliad, Connectivia, Netoip, Wirlab, Springo and Afinna One, 
while other agreements are being defined.

(UBB) networks and 5G have led to an unprecedented acceleration in the telecommunications sector. This is a 
phenomenon that is opening up new possibilities, and that is profoundly changing people's habits, as they 
become increasingly accustomed to living in a smart and connected world. 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  TIM continues to invest in Brazil , with a focus mainly on new 
generation infrastructure construction, actively contributing to the modernization of the country. With respect 
to 5G, TIM acquired 11 lots, with a total value offered of R$ 1.05 billion.
[GRI 203-1] In order to improve the reach and accessibility of TIM SA mobile broadband, and as part of the 
technological evolution outlined in the most recent Industrial Plan presented to the financial community, 4G 
coverage is set to be extended (compared to the LTE 700 MHz bandwidth), with the expansion of VoLTE8, an 
increase in the number of bio-sites installed, and support for the launch of the fiber optic network alongside 
the ultrabroadband plan.
[GRI 203-2] In December 2021 TIM S.A.  reached 4,700 towns, in addition to supporting the development of 
technical partnerships for social and business initiatives. Through its open innovation program, TIM S.A. invests 
in initiatives that promote the renewal and exchange of knowledge with universities, for the development of

TIM's commitment to the “Operazione Risorgimento Digitale” program continued in 2021, with the aim of 
accelerating digital skills for citizens, businesses and public administrations. Today, digital is the main tool for 
inclusion, participation and access to the world and its opportunities. Being aware of the possibilities that 
technology offers and having the basic skills to take advantage of them is now an imperative. Using the 
network during a health emergency has become the only way to stay connected to the real world. It is 
therefore necessary that everyone has access to a connection they can use to its full potential, safely and with 
respect for themselves and others. 
The actions carried out in 2021 were outlined according to the four thematic axes identified in the National 
Strategy for digital skills and developed within the framework of the "Digital Republic" initiative of which TIM is

■In 2021 the partnership with 42 Roma Luiss, the special free school of coding was created . Based on the 
French École 42 model, the school – targeted to 150 students - does not have any age or education limits 
or requirements, but only requires a commitment to and passion for computer programming, known as 
coding, to be enjoyed through self-managed learning processes and reciprocal exchanges. TIM expanded 
the program with training meetings and workshops on digital skills. In 2021 TIM interviewed 10 students 
and selected 4 for the company internship to be held in 2022.

■Internet School for All:  a digital literacy program targeted to individuals of all ages who have had the 
opportunity to concretely learn how digital applications and services can simplify daily activities. That 
process was made possible due to the voluntary involvement of 120 TIM employees, who have formed 
an actual Community of Teachers & Tutors . During the year, the Internet School for All developed its own 
real cooperation network, comprised of hybrid alliances between government and private organizations: 
we worked with organizations and associations (community holders) that work in the general interest, to 
jointly increase human. From the local health authority of Taranto to the Municipality of Quartu 
Sant’Elena, from the 50&Più (50 and up) association to the Time Bank Network of Lombardy, up to the 
Università della Terza Età (University for Seniors) and the Municipality of Trieste, more than 110 local 
entities, associations and voluntary organizations throughout Italy found concrete opportunities in the 
project to meet the needs of their users, individuals, communities and local areas. Specifically, the 
partnership with the Municipality of Genoa gave rise to a special edition of the course with a detailed focus 
on Digital Identity and Fascicolo del Cittadino (Individual Dossier) of Genoa. In total, 970 courses were 
provided, with 45,800 participations in the single modules and over 15,000 unique participants.

to the live broadcast
■To meet the need to favor increased awareness of the potential offered by the digital world, TIM and 
RaiPlay created the docu-series Storie di Risorgimento Digitale  [Stories of Digital Rinascimento]:  8 episodes 
in which each story is a voyage within its protagonist’s life, which also intends to act as an inspiration for 
the communities targeted, a process of awareness of the new possibilities that are available to us all, often 
using our smartphone. The series is available from December 7 and, based on an initial survey, in the first 
few days of January 2022, it reached 15,000 views (figure continuously being updated).
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  AGCom resolutions28
TIM's commitments in Italy, in terms of discounts and specific measures, as in the past, essentially concerned 
the following categories of customers: 
■the deaf, blind and visually impaired and disabled with severe limitations to their ability to walk. In 
compliance with the resolution of the Authority for Communications Guarantees (AGCom) No. 46/2017/
CONS, TIM has given both internet and landline and mobile line concession offers to deaf, blind or partially 
sighted customers29. These concessions never expire and once activated do not require any request for 
renewal, and are also reserved for the nuclear family in which the deaf, blind or partially sighted person 
lives (for further information regarding concessions, it is possible to contact TIM customer service 187 and 
119). Assistance can also be provided for the deaf by contacting TIM customer service 187 and 119 with the 
Pedius app, available for Apple and Android, which uses voice recognition and speech synthesis 
technologies, transforming the voice of the operator into written text for the customer. 
Moreover, in October 2021, TIM made the new technical assistance service TIMinLIS available: a simple guided 
process using the grammar of Italian Sign Language to open a help ticket and resolve failures. A video call with 
the assistance of an LIS (Italian Sign Language) interpreter for all technical assistance services enables deaf 
customers to directly communicate using their personal computer, smartphone or tablet with an LIS video 
interpreter and a TIM online technician.
In October 2021, with resolution 290/21/CONS, AGCom approved a series of changes for 2022, which include, 
on a test basis, extending these concessions also to the “disabled with serious limitations to their ability to 
walk” (receivers of tax benefits pursuant to art. 30, subsection 7 of Italian Law 388/2000, certified by a disability 
certificate). Therefore, at the end of November, in compliance with that resolution, TIM informed the market of 
that test through a specific update to its website, in the section “Agevolazioni per utenti con 
disabilità” [Concessions for users with disabilities]. That resolution, which replaces resolution 46/17/CONS, 
requires that, for mobile telephony, at least three mobile offers with a 50% discount must be available, with a 
specific data limit, among the portfolio of offers of each operator, and for fixed telephony, voice and data 
bundle offers (with a 50% discount) are required, but the exemption from the VOICE subscription charge is no 
longer provided for new customers, for whom free ADSL is planned.
Customers already benefited from the previous concessions (free voice and 180 hours of free ADSL internet) 
will continue to benefit from them. Another important change is the availability of a free dedicated digital 
channel, from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. to assist disabled consumers, which allows them, after identifying 
themselves, to report a failure or theft of their mobile device, request technical assistance, send a complaint or 
receive information. That channel must guarantee response times aimed at the utmost efficiency of the 
service;
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 9728 Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni (Italian Communications Authority).29 [GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203]  In accordance with the aforementioned resolution, for: 
• fixed telephony, for the benefit of deaf customers, is exempt from the telephone service subscription fee (Voice Offer), with 180 free monthly 
hours of internet (broadband ADSL connections) on the offer “by usage” already active on the line (the benefit was only available to customers 
who had activated a by usage offer before January 14, 2018). There is also a discount of 50% on the subscription to an additional internet offer or 
a discount of 50% on the subscription to voice+internet offers, as specified for blind and partially sighted customers (different offers in the TIM 
SMART HOME and FIBRE range);  
• mobile telephony the TIM concessions guarantee a 20 Gb volume of data traffic and the sending of SMS Unlimited for deaf customers (TIM Easy 
SMS+GB), while, for blind and partially sighted customers, an offer consisting of unlimited minutes of voice traffic and a volume of data traffic of 
10 Gb (TIM Easy VOICE+GB). These dedicated offers are on the tim.it websites: tim.it/agevolazioni-per-non-vedenti-e-non-udenti/offerte-fisso; 
tim.it/agevolazioni-per-non-vedenti-e-non-udenti/offerte-mobile. ■people on low incomes who find themselves in a situation of “economic and social hardship.” TIM reserves 
such concessions - established by AGCom30 or by the Company on its own initiative31 - for customers with 
an ISEE32 family unit income not exceeding 8,112.23 euros/year, for telephone use service in their primary 
residence (on the traditional PSTN network33). The concession is valid for the same duration as their ISEE34 
certificate (January 15 of the year following issue) and the request must be renewed annually;
■“social card” holders35. On its own initiative, TIM gives these customers a reduction on the telephone 
service subscription amount (14.69 euros/month including VAT). The benefit is valid for one year and is 
automatically renewed on January 1 of each year. In this case, these benefits cannot be combined with 
each other and the customer can request only one;
In addition, TIM guarantees to support customers residing in areas affected by natural disasters (seismic 
events, floods), ensuring business continuity both in the phase of emergency management and in the 
medium/long term, to protect their needs. 
At the end of 2020, for consumer customers, the Voucher Offer was prepared (connectivity offer with a public 
contribution of 500 euros), firstly available only for the list of municipalities coming under the scope of the 
Voucher Plan and, during 2021, extended to the entire country, reserved for households with ISEE (Equivalent 
Financial Situation Index) income of less than 20,000 euros and whose homes do not have any connectivity 
service activated with a speed of at least 30 Mbit/s. The marketing of the Voucher Offer lasted 12 months, as 
set out in the government regulations, and therefore, it was stopped at the end of 2021.
The Voucher offer envisaged a contribution of:
■200 euros to activate an internet connection with a speed of at least 30 Mbit/s;
■300 euros if a tablet or computer is purchased at the same time.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 9830 AGCom Resolution No. 258/18/CONS (already approved by AGCom 314/00/CONS and 330/01/CONS) provides for a 50% reduction of the 
subscription amount for the voice offer (9.44 euros/month VAT included) and a total of 30 minutes of free calls per month to national landlines 
and mobile phones. Once the free minutes limit has been exceeded, national calls to landlines and mobile phones are charged at the expected by 
usage prices for the voice offer (10 cents/min including VAT, without a connection fee).

Commitment to our people
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 401] The intellectual capital represented by expertise, skills, capacity 
and knowledge produces innovation. Motivation and enthusiasm produce quality and high service levels.
The Human Resources department therefore becomes increasingly strategic for all companies, precisely 
because it has the important objective of creating the ideal conditions so that each person can give the best of 
themselves, thereby enhancing the performance of the company.
This principle is particularly valid for TIM, a historical company in the ICT world, an extremely competitive 
sector with rapid technological evolution where no one can afford not to cultivate the most valuable and 
profitable capital: professionalism, creativity, the ability to work in a team, and people’s desire to win.
The development of the company’s human capital, therefore, and the management of contracts of 
employment, are also confirmed in 2021 as relevant topics in the materiality analysis.
By way of strengthening and guiding our commitment to people, in 2021, the Policy was published that guides 
and inspires the management and development of all TIM people. 
The policy envisages commitments and indications on certain specific aspects:
■Engagement, respect and inclusion
■Work-life balance and support for People
■Development and Training
■Protection of Health and Safety and prevention of Occupational Diseases.
The 2021-2023 Sustainability Plan includes ESG objectives regarding human resources, to be achieved by the 
end of 2023: the targets through to 2022 have been revised upwards in relation to people engagement and 
gender equality and inclusion objectives added to the remuneration of management. 
ESG targets of the 2021-2023 Plan, Domestic BU:
■Employees engagement : +19pp, expected for 2023 compared to 2019; the growth of 19pp was easily 
reached in 2021, with an improvement of 20 pp.
■Retraining : reaching 6.4 million hours of training by 2023. 4.9 million hours of training were provided in 
2021.
■Young adult churn (limitation of the churn rate of employees aged under 37) : the target churn, of less 
than 15% over the three-year period 2021-23, stood at 3.2% in 2021.
In the 2022-2024 ESG Plan , presented to the financial community on March 3, 2022, the following targets 
through to 2024 are envisaged for the Domestic BU:
■Employees engagement on young adults : reach/exceed 78%.
■% of employees trained on ESG topics : 90%.
In managerial remuneration, the structure of the ESG objective for 2021 strengthens the centrality of 
employees in the pursuit of the strategic objectives, such as employee engagement - already envisaged in 
2020 - adding a diversity & inclusion component, represented by the goal of reducing the pay gap between 
men and women on the management team. With the 2021-2023 plan, gender equality objectives are 
consolidated with the introduction of targets on the pay gap and managerial representation of women.
In addition, the objective of restructuring the buildings and extending agile working to most employees has 
been hastened by the pandemic. Up to October 4, 2021, due to the health emergency, all TIM employees in 
Italy worked remotely, with the exception of the departments in which their physical presence was 
indispensable. After that date, they were given the choice between working in the office or agile working.
The health emergency, which has changed the way people work and required action to be taken on several 
fronts to ensure that people's health and performance continue to be guaranteed, required the well-being of 
people within the Company and their sense of belonging to be strengthened, expanding and implementing 
remote work alongside an appropriate organization of work.
Digitally upgraded training courses, work reorganization and the need to increase the use of agile work have 
been fundamental for the overall well-being of people and therefore the Company. 
The primary importance of recruitment and of ensuring a good work-life balance was confirmed; in this 
context, action was taken to keep interpersonal relationships strong despite the lack of proximity. 
The results of the activities of the engagement plan are essentially measured through the annual engagement 
survey. The evolution of TIM Citizens’ engagement in the last 3 years was:
■ 2019: 56%, with participation of 64% of the population
■ 2020: 72%, with participation of 76% of the population 
■ 2021: 76%, with participation of 83% of the population. 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 99Again as part of the engagement survey, the average personal satisfaction value was recorded, which, on a 
scale from 1 to 5 was: in 2019 – 3.15; in 2020 - 3.63; in 2021 - 3.82.
The percentage of people fully satisfied (values 4 and 5 out of a scale of 1 to 5) was 42% in 2019 and 65% in 
2020, while it rose to 73% in 2021. 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 401]  The Head of the Human Resources & Organization department is 
appointed by the Chief Executive Officer. The variable short-term remuneration policy (MBO) assigns the Head 
of Department objectives aligned with the strategy aimed towards Human Resources.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 401] [GRI 402] [GRI 404]  In Brazil , TIM continued with work aimed at 
maintaining the efficiency of its workforce, promoting a healthy, safe, productive and inclusive work 
environment for its employees.
The company continued pursuing the goal of reconciling the company’s needs with those of employees, 
through enhanced, proactive listening. As regards the results of people engagement, in Brazil  97% of the entire 
workforce participated in the annual Corporate Climate Survey in 2021. Though within the complex scenario 
that marked the period, the general level of satisfaction of employees continued to be exceptional, reaching a 
result of 83% and keeping TIM among the best companies in the country for people engagement. 
All the remote working methods and dynamics were consolidated. Therefore, TIM was able to define a 
structured plan to enable employees to gradually return to working at the office, in accordance with all the 
prevention and safety protocols and rules. The testing phase of the "ritorno" (return to the office) was 
implemented in October 2021 by establishing a personalized hybrid model that provides various percentage 
mixes of in-office and remote work, depending on the various departments, in line with the organizational 
characteristics of the various areas, for the purpose of assessing and understanding employees’ responses to 
the hybrid model. 
The company continued investing in personnel development, also due to the opportunities provided by the 
dissemination of digital instruments. Specific attention was focused on the training plans relating to new skills 
and critical business knowledge (e.g. Journey 2 Cloud and Agile Methodologies), operating efficiency (Sales and 
Customer Care) and a wide range of behavioral content on a variety of topics, including remote working 
practices, well-being, mental health, health protocols, new working methods and so on.
Despite the impacts of the pandemic, in 2021 the company continued operating in an extremely dynamic labor 
market and a highly competitive business context, which led to TIM increasing the flexibility of its HR policies 
(ex. revising remuneration and hiring requirements) and strengthening its focus on operating efficiency as well 
as on investments in new skills and on developing talents, which is indispensable to face the challenges laid 
down by the telecommunications sector.
For all of 2021, the Human Resources department conducted frequent surveys to investigate specific issues. 
These surveys include the second annual survey on working from home (1,767 respondents) to assess the 
experience of remote working, analyzing aspects such as engagement, productivity, work flow, interaction with 
colleagues, leadership and others. Additional surveys were also carried out, such as those on connectivity, IT 
systems and security, as well as constant measurement of the eNPS1, which measures employee 
recommendations about our products, services and the Company. 
In addition to the surveys, a structured internal program was created, called "We are All Customers,” to 
engage employees in assessing, building and improving Customer Experience processes. From February to 
December, a total of 12 projects were assessed, with a total of 4,900 participants. The internal communication 
plan developed in 2020 continued to prevent the dissemination of unstructured communications regarding the 
repercussions of the pandemic also in 2021. Moreover, in order to guarantee full comprehension of the 
strategic challenges and engagement of personnel, structured communications plans were implemented, as 
well as a series of “cascade” meetings regarding the Business Plan, the strategic targets and results. 
In dealing with the issues relating to the efficiency and effectiveness of processes, the Company’s 
organizational structure underwent continuous evolution, to achieve the strategic objectives. For this reason, a 
structured process re-engineering project was confirmed, aimed at disseminating new work methods (e.g. 
Agile, DevOpes) and innovative, cross-functional models capable of increasing productivity.
The Head of the HR department in Brazil continues to report directly to the CEO of TIM S.A..

[GRI 102-8] TIM does not use self-employed workers to carry out its business activities, although it is possible 
that, on an occasional basis, some consultancy type activities may be entrusted to self-employed 
professionals. 
The Group’s activities do not vary seasonally, hence changes in the workforce are correctly shown by the 
annual trends.
For further details about the characteristics of Group personnel go to Appendix of this chapter, which, with 
respect to the requirements of the GRI Standard, contains the following indicators [GRI 102-8], [GRI 401-1], [GRI 
401-3], [GRI 404-1], [GRI 412-2], [GRI 405-2].
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1011 Unless otherwise stated, the data shown in the tables contained in the chapter relates to all the Group companies.Equity and gender inclusion  
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 405]]  There is still a long way to go before true gender balance can be 
achieved in the telecommunications sector which, like all sectors where the main activity is strictly linked to 
research and development of new technologies, still continues to have a mainly male workforce. As women 
have embraced the world of work and, in a parallel fashion, scientific and technological culture and studies, 
their presence has gradually grown within companies, seeing them take on more important roles with higher 
salaries.
In particular, TIM's Bylaws will be amended to reflect the allocation criteria established by Law No. 160/2019 for 
both the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors, maintaining their applicability on an ongoing 
basis; it will not be necessary to change the composition of the corporate bodies that already reflect the new 
shareholding (6/15 on the Board of Directors and 2/5 on the Board of Statutory Auditors, respectively).
The current development model pays close attention to ensuring that individual growth paths, starting from 
the moment employees are hired, do not contain any restrictions relating to gender or age differences, and 
particular attention is paid to women, where skills and performance are equal. Furthermore, under the current 
competence model, specific competencies are considered, pertaining to leadership, communication and 
inclusive collaboration1.
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 405]  To reduce the gender gap, TIM implemented a three-year plan 
(2018/2020) with the aim of increasing manager awareness of unconscious prejudice by 25%. The following 
actions were carried out:
■Review the managerial model, adding a conduct specifically related to inclusion, in particular of gender, in 
line with the Code of Ethics and the Human Rights Policy.
■Develop a self-assessment campaign on gender prejudice, through intranet news and the on-line “Implicit 
test” prepared by the University of Harvard on various prejudices.
■Introduction of an e-learning training course on unconscious prejudice.
■Introduction of flexibility measures for pregnant women.
■Introduction of flexibility measures for maternity/paternity leave.
■Launch of a “Manifesto for the reduction of the gender gap.”
As regards the spread of the equal opportunities culture, by December 31, 2021, TIM proposed it would strive to 
achieve the following objectives:
■at least 50% of the company population shows awareness of the initiatives (the target was reached and 
exceeded by 12.17%);
■development dedicated to a pool of women employees and involvement of at least 80% of them (the 
target was reached and exceeded by 19.75%).
As regards female managers and the pay gap, managerial incentives have been introduced that expect to 
achieve the following for Italy, by December 31, 2023:
■26% of all executives will be female. 
■the gender pay gap for management staff will be zeroed.
In the 2022-2024 ESG Plan , TIM strengthened its commitment to reducing the gender gap, expanding the 
basin of reference to all women holding top positions (executives+middle managers) in Italy and specifically 
defining the growth targets up to 2024: 23.8% by 2022, 25.3% by 2023 and 27% by 2024. At a Group level, the 
target through to 2024 is 29%2. 
In Brazil , TIM continued its gender diversity work, one of the main pillars of its Diversity & Inclusion plan. 
Gender equality is one of the main focuses of Diversity & Inclusion. Various initiatives were developed 
throughout 2021, as described in the following chapters. In 2020 TIM Brasil was included in the TEVA index as 
the third company in country (listed on BOVESPA, the Brazilian stock exchanged) in terms of the number of 
women on the BoD.

The generational imbalance is mainly due to the Italian component that, due to adverse market conditions 
and in order to guarantee work for its employees, has in the past renounced generational renewal through 
major new hiring campaigns. Since end 2019, the Group has been hiring with a specific focus on key figures for 
the sector. 
Within the Group, there are 3,374 employees that are part of ethnic minorities, all concentrated in the Brazil 
BU. 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 104New skill and development
The skill model
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 404] The TIM Competence and 
Leadership Model has undergone a major overhaul and has been restructured according to the new corporate 
identity. During 2022, communication and training initiatives will be launched to support the dissemination and 
knowledge of the underlying skills. 
Below are the main development activities that defined 2021:
■Young Adult Development : [GRI 404-2] The development course (Beyond the Garden) started in 2020 and 
which continued throughout 2021 involved 250 young adults aged under 35, with the aim of fostering the 
strengthening of competences, increasing engagement, facilitating the intergenerational exchange and 
the development of management skills through mentoring, coaching, job shadowing and hackathons, all 
much appreciated by participants.
■Performance Management  [GRI 404-3] : the annual appreciation process of working performance generally 
involves the evaluation of the goals and competences of the entire workforce and is divided into five 
phases (assignment of objectives, mid-year review, evaluator’s selection, evaluation and feedback). Insofar 
as regards the 2021 Performance Management process, the decision was made to take into account the 
exceptional situation brought about by the pandemic emergency and, therefore, the assessment only 
regarded competences. Specifically, in 2021, approximately 41,000 resources form the Domestic scope 
were involved in the performance assessment process: 97% received an assessment from their manager 
and 79% of these confirmed they had also received dedicated feedback from their manager. 
■Skill Assessment [GRI 404-2]:  is an online assessment tool, which makes it possible to focus on a picture of 
the population in terms of skills, knowledge and motivation, useful for the timely detection of training 
needs in support of organizational changes and changes in business skills. Projects developed in 2021 
regarded smart working, digital culture, ICT, transversal skills (agile, data culture, cybersecurity, etc.), 
knowledge and competence in sale, etc., for the whole population or specific segments, depending on the 
areas investigated. Adhesion rates to the various initiatives were decidedly high, coming in at more than 
91% for all surveys. 
■Potential evaluation system:  [GRI 404-2]  is a process that contributes to the identification and 
enhancement of the Company's current and future managerial assets and which supports the people 
involved in their development path. In 2020, the entire system was refined and following validation of the 
new system of competences (end October 2021), the tests and reports of the various types of assessment 
(individual, group, operative coordination, managerial and executive) will be revised.
■TIM professional system:  The major transformations in the company, the switch to new development 
models and the evolution of economic balance require companies to play a strategic role. In this scenario, 
the scene of professional roles and associated competences are also particularly dynamic. The challenge 
TIM has addressed, therefore, is to make the professional system consistent with changes in the 
employment market, integrating it with new jobs, describing the core competences and promoting the 
acquisition of emerging competences. During 2022, the review of professional roles, the relevant 
competences and reference grading, will be validated with the lines. 
In July 2020, an agreement was signed with INAPP - the National Public Policy Analysis Institution - with a view 
to identifying points of correlation between the current company professional system and the INAPP 
Employment Atlas. It is expected that the anchorage of TIM’s professional system with the employment atlas 
will be completed by June 2022.
Development activities and skills in Brazil 
[GRI 404-2] [GRI 404-3]  During 2021, TIM S.A.  implemented numerous programs and measures to manage and 
support the development of skills for personnel that are necessary to implement the business strategies.
■New skills model: In Q1 2021 a new skills and conduct model was developed and communicated to all 
employees. The model was created in cooperation with the entire company, and is used to handle various 
processes, such as Internal and External Recruitment, Performance Management, Talent Management, 
Training and Development and Management of Remuneration.
■New Performance Management Process: TIM S.A. completed the 2020-2021 performance management 
cycle, which involved over 7,700 employees, with several important changes, such as the addition of new 
targets (Sales & Caring team, Interns), with an extensively personalized approach. The assessment focused 
on the skills model and the ability to implement it. Another change involved the implementation of a new 
Performance Management platform, personalized to offer the employees involved the best digital 
experience.
■Solutions for developing digital leadership: During the year, TIM launched two innovative solutions for 
developing its leaders: the E-Coaching Program and the Executive Mentoring Program. Over 350 leaders 
tested a digital professional development solution, personalized based on their needs. The E-Coaching 
program is a short coaching program comprising 5 sessions with an ICF-certified coach. It has been offered 
to more than 270 recently-promoted junior leaders. In addition to these 5 sessions, the participants can use 
a digital platform with numerous functions and extensive content to speed up the solving of problems and 
the development of their managerial conduct. Executive Mentoring was offered to 80 executives of TIM 
S.A., who had the opportunity to have a 1-hour discussion with an external expert selected from a base of 
over 90 mentors. Over 340 discussions were held to develop new skills, share best practices and stimulate 
new drivers for business development.
■Succession management: This year, succession mapping continued, to guarantee the acceleration of the 
development and readying of replacements for the most critical senior management and executive 
positions. Over 25 senior managers were subject to a Top Executive Assessment by an external Leadership 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 105Advisory company, and had their development plans implemented. TIM S.A. also continued to encourage 
the internal succession of managers, in accordance with its own recruitment policies and before turning to 
the external market to find candidates.
■Inter-company mentoring for women: in July 2021, TIM, along with an increasing number of large 
companies, implemented an initiative to accelerate the professional growth of women. The initiative is 
included in the "Mulheres Positivas ” project, which aims to enable and accelerate women’s access to the 
Brazilian labor market. In 2021, 2 rounds of tutoring were held, which involved 149 women.
■Internal and external recruitment: In 2021 TIM consolidated the digitization of the entire Recruitment and 
Selection process, using artificial intelligence and people analytics, with a view to increased quality and 
efficiency. We have also strengthened our commitment to diversity policies, introducing customized 
targets for racial inclusion (around 60% of people in our internship programs are black) and gender 
inclusion (the shortlists for leadership positions are 50% women).  In line with TIM’s business and strategic 
plans, our focus was expanded to attracting and recruiting new skills and profiles, concentrating on the 
necessary professionals such as: Big Data, Cybersecurity, Cloud, Agile. Internal selection opportunities 
generated by TIM S.A.’s recruitment policy, as an integral part of its HR practices, reached the target of 
filling 33% of all vacancies through internal staff rotation positions (employees + managers).

TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 106Training
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 404] [GRI 404-2]  The transformation of the TLC industry towards 
digital company models, the technological evolution of infrastructure and market challenges linked to the 
development of new digital and innovative services are all part of an employment market undergoing 
profound transformation. Continuing with what has been launched in recent years, TIM Academy boosted the 
development of systems and paths to disseminate and share of knowledge, promote organizational learning 
and adapt the skills of TIM people to changes in business and technology.
With the professional requalification and training plan, TIM Academy involves almost all employees in the 14 
courses for the evolution and adjustment of the portfolio of competences in support of the company 
transformation process and the necessary update of the professional technical skills. The plan started last June 
2021, following the agreement signed with the trade unions and the Ministry of Labor, and will continue up to 
2022.
Starting out from the strategic drivers of the business plan, the needs, plans, methods of delivery and 
supporting tools, were identified.
[GRI 404-1]  At a Group level, in 2021, over 5.3 million hours of training were delivered, with an average of 
approximately 102 hours per head; the investment came to approximately 15.7 million euros during the year, 
making for an average per capita investment of approximately 300 euros. The investment in training involved 
financing from FONDIMPRESA of 5.5 million euros to the Parent Company.
Training Program
One of the pillars of the People's Plan is a continuous training program to support the digitization process and 
update skills. In keeping with the identified program definition drivers1, the TIM Academy platform, which is 
always available with multi-device access, presents learning plans that are customized to the person and role, 
with an “open” training offer with guided self-learning courses on specialized skills and professions.
The main areas of activity are:
■Development of digital skills : the NexTIM training and development plan includes 7 transversal courses2 to 
the company departments to acquire the new capabilities required by the evolution of the context and the 
emergency situation that has significantly hastened the digital transformation.
■Requalification of role skills : the NexTIM training and development plan envisages 12 courses3 per 
business line, dedicated to the competences of the role and the area to strengthen employability and learn 
the professions of the future. By way of example, the tech training course, intended for approximately 
2000 participants, is made up of technical courses delivered on subjects such as cyber security, the core 5G 
network, quantum computing, an advanced course for technical staff and specialized courses on 
programming languages and the web, native cloud development and IT infrastructure and the cloud.
■Management education : the plan of action for the managerial target includes various inspirational and 
immersive education projects4 intended to enhance distinctive skills and affirm TIM's leadership and 
competitiveness in the digital age. The broader plan involving the entire management is supported by 
individual coaching, group coaching and individual paths.
■English@TIM Language Training : online language training courses, personalized based on levels of 
knowledge, aimed at helping people learn English, with a view to the digital transformation. Over 1,000 
people used the training content available in the TIM Academy.
■Institutional and corporate culture : this training aims to support the transformation of the organizational 
culture in line with the evolution of the social, environmental and economic context and at disseminating 
knowledge of the content required by the legal formalities. This training, which is mandatory for all 
company personnel, aims to raise awareness and spread knowledge on content put forward by the 
Compliance (on topics related to Market Abuse Regulation and ISO 37001 on Anti-corruption), Regulatory 
and Equivalence (on Antitrust and Regulatory topics), Privacy and ITS Compliance (for GDPR and MIMIP 
topics) departments. With regard to health and safety at work training, which is promoted by the Health 
Safety & Environment department, all staff are trained according to the legal requirements set by 
Legislative Decree 81/08, as amended, and the profiles identified for each worker as part of the DVR (Risk 
Assessment Document). All personnel operating in the Security Department of TIM are trained and 
updated on national and European Community legislation and regulations governing company safety, and 
carry out their duties in complete compliance with all current company procedures and policies in force.  
Security personnel do not perform crowd control duties nor escort people or valuables, which is instead a 
task institutionally assigned to the police force.
■Training for young peopl e: since the beginning of 2021, more than 400 newly-hired employees have been 
involved through dedicated training courses, participation in the OrienTIMing community, information and 
training webinars and the assignment of approximately 130 tutors as contacts for the department to which 
they belong. Furthermore, the development pathway launched in 2020 for 250 young people under 35 
already working in the Company (Beyond the Garden) for several years, with the aim of encouraging the 
enhancement of skills, increasing engagement, promoting intergenerational relationships and managerial 
development, is about to be completed.

In Brazil , TIM’s training strategy in 2021 focused on supporting the evolution and transformation of the 
company towards the Digital Telco model. During the year, it specifically focused on developing new skills 
through upskilling\reskilling programs and a concerted effort was made to improve the alignment of skills in 
the operational departments.
We consolidated our objective, spreading an environment of digital and company learning and developing 
customized programs for specific issues and recipients, expanding the digitization of our training activities. The 
main development and training programs are listed below: 
For all employees: 
■Main institutional and conformity issues : all employees attended courses on key institutional and 
compliance issues, such as ethics, human rights, sustainability and environmental policies, safety, security 
and anti-corruption policies in alignment with Group guidelines and international and national laws.
■Cross-training initiatives :  
•Digital Learning Roadmap : the new "Talent HUB Aprendizagem” online training platform includes 
individual and collective roadmaps for digital learning. The roadmap focused on strategic issues such 
as digital mentality, new skills, innovation, responsibility, customer experience, execution, cooperative 
approach online and change management. 
•COVID-19 plan : Support to adapting to the "new normal" through digital content. As a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, TIM Brasil arranged training initiatives dedicated to topics such as mental and 
emotional health, care, well-being and also made the Onboarding programs content available in digital 
format. Furthermore, all training initiatives have been adapted to the distance method. Leadership was 
involved through meetings and seminars to talk about day-to-day management, remote leadership 
and how to take care of professionals, raising awareness about the new form of remote working and 
ensuring employee productivity.
•TIM Talks : the Annual Training, Development and Communication program of TIM S.A. Just like in 
2020, the event was attended by the internal and external public. The program started in November 
with an opening event, and continued till the end of December, with a range of workshops focused on 
strategic issues for the sector, such as 5G, Cloud Computing, IA and Privacy. Representatives of the 
market, the academic world and institutions in general participated in the workshop as well as, for the 
first time, international guests. More than 12,000 people participated in the program, as well as 9,000 
accesses on TIM’s YouTube channel and a Net Promoter Score of 92%. 
Vertical paths:  TIM has created personalized learning paths for the various Departments based on the 
different needs related to the activity. 
Initiatives for the sales force : Evolution program (Consumer and Business): learning path for TIM stores, 
designed in an innovative way, based on the principle of a big game, which translated into greater 
involvement, new knowledge with a different "footprint", and greater value for the company. A unique, 
personalized and humanized experience. The model of virtual training was retained and improved during 2021.
Internships and apprenticeships : Young apprentices & interns program: TIM offered specific Onboarding and 
face-to-face and digital training activities to over 300 young people including apprentices and interns. 
Path towards the Cloud and Agile Working Path : In line with our digital transformation and innovation plan, 
TIM implemented a structured upskilling plan for all professionals involved in the migration of infrastructure to 
a multi-cloud environment, and for users of new Data and Analytics technologies. More than 500 people were 
involved in the two-year period 2020-2021. The Agile working program was developed in 2021, with the goal of 
disseminating the culture, methods and tools of Agile working, and involved more than 170 people.
For both paths, a structured internal communications plan has been implemented, to demonstrate the 
importance of the initiatives and increase the engagement of participants. Working with our main suppliers 
and technology partners, an external communications plan was then developed.

Coverage and per capita are calculated on the average number of staff in 2021 (figure higher in quantity than the amount existing as at 12/31).Remuneration policy
[GRI 102-37]  The TIM Group’s remuneration policy is intended to ensure the necessary levels of competitiveness 
of the company on the labor market and to support the achievement of the Company's strategic objectives as 
a lever for implementing some of the business strategy guidelines. For 2021, the guidelines of the 
remuneration policy are defined in accordance with the resolutions of the Shareholders' Meeting of March 2021 
and the remuneration tools already in use. 
The resulting remuneration architecture is intended to balance remuneration (fixed and variable) and enhance 
the benefit and welfare system, supported by other tools, such as the Broad-Based Share Ownership Plan, with 
a view to pursuing sustainable results in the long term in line with TIM's risk management policy.
The components of individual remuneration are:
The fixed component  takes into account the breadth and strategic nature of the position held and is dictated 
by performance in the reference markets. 
Periodic comparisons of internal remunerations and external market remuneration practices allow the 
establishment of the remuneration strategy to be adopted; TIM’s comparative remuneration market is Italian 
companies of comparable size and/or market capitalization, and international telecoms and media companies. 
The need to ensure financially sustainable management of the business requires selectivity in the application 
of salary increases, which - in the same way as the previous year - will be granted to employees considered to 
be highly valuable and where there is misalignment with respect to the reference market. 
In addition to changes to fixed remuneration, during salary reviews, other variable remuneration instruments 
(One-Off Bonus) can be put in place - excluding Senior Management with Strategic Responsibilities - to reward 
outstanding performance or particularly good results during extraordinary initiatives not part of normal 
activities.
Variable remuneration 
The growing commitment to sustainability issues has been consistently applied in the variable remuneration 
policy of recent years: for 2021 the presence of targets connected to the impact of TIM's activities on the 
environment and employee engagement was further strengthened. Diversity & Inclusion objectives were 
introduced for the first time: the short-term incentive system includes an objective that pursues a reduction in 
the gender pay gap, while the long-term one includes a parameter that measures the percentage of women 
managers. 
The short-term variable remuneration (MBO)  aims to establish a transparent link between pay and the 
degree of fulfilment of annual targets. To this end, the targets were fixed according to quantitative indicators 
that represent and are consistent with the strategic priorities and business plan, measured according to pre-
established and objective criteria. 
For 2021, the MBO system again includes a “gate” target consisting of the Group EBITDA indicator, a condition 
for accessing the bonus linked to all the incentive objectives, with differentiated minimum levels of access to 
the bonus, in order to appreciate the different level of challenge required of management. The structure of the 
ESG objective for 2021 strengthens the centrality of the two essential stakeholders for the Company, external 
customers and internal employees, in pursuing the strategic objectives, alongside the Customer Satisfaction 
and Employee Engagement objectives - already required in 2020 - also a component of Diversity & Inclusion, 
represented by the objective of reducing the pay gap between women and men among the executive staff. 
While remaining central, the weight of the employee engagement objective has been re-proportioned 
compared to last year due to the very positive result achieved in 2020 compared to the targets previously 
communicated to the market. The overall weight of the indicator is 22% of the total of the objectives assigned. 
With regard to the remaining targets set in MBO, for direct reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, the focus is 
on the economic and financial objectives attributed to the Chief Executive Officer and a strategic departmental 
objective has been introduced; for the other managers, the most significant economic and financial objectives 
and specific departmental objectives, which are objectively measurable, are considered. For those who report 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 110directly to Executive Directors, the bonus target values are consistent with the previous years and constitute up 
to 50% of the fixed component. For the remaining incentivized staff, the target values are set - based on the 
role complexity - at up to 30% of the fixed component.
With regard to the incentive system payout, the potential impact of the corrective payout reduction factor 
introduced in 2019 was confirmed for 2021 with the aim of increasing the attention and sensitivity of managers 
to the Company’s internal control and risk management issues.  
The accrued bonus is fully liquidated in cash form, at the time that the results achieved are confirmed1. 
Executives will also be free to choose between having the bonus paid with their salary or having some or all of 
the amount paid into their complementary pension fund.
Long-term variable  remuneration is aimed at promoting consistency between the interests of management 
and those of shareholders, through sharing of the business risk. 
The 2nd Incentive Cycle of the 2020-2022 Long Term Incentive (LTI) Plan approved by the Shareholders' 
Meeting in April 2020 was launched in 2021. This is an equity based, rolling Plan that provides for three 
incentive cycles. Each cycle has a three-year vesting period2 and a two-year lock-up. 
Consistent with the 1st cycle 2020-2022, it provides for the assignment of a performance share component 
(70%) and an attraction/retention share component (30%), with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer 
who is only assigned performance shares. 
The performance share  component provides for the free assignment of TIM ordinary shares with a vesting 
period subject to an access “gate” linked to the value of the share and to two equity and business performance 
conditions.
The attraction/retention  share component provides for the free assignment of TIM ordinary shares with a 
vesting period subject to continued employment with TIM or Group companies. 
A payout gain/loss mechanism is applied to both components, which are linked, for 2021, in equal measure, 
both to the growth in the % of renewable energy out of the total energy purchased and to the growth in the 
presence of woman managers. For both the MBO system and long-term plans, a contractual claw-back 
mechanism3 is in force, which allows for retrieval of the variable remuneration paid out to Executive Directors 
and managers with strategic responsibilities starting from 2016. As defined in the policy, the claw-back clause 
can be triggered in the three years following payment of the sums. 
Moreover, the new 2022-2024 Long-Term Plan , the stock option plan proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting of 
April 7, 2022, includes economic-financial (cumulated reported EBITDA – CAPEX) and ESG performance 
conditions, the latter linked to gender diversity and renewable energy. Specifically, the plan requires that the 
exercise of 30% of option rights may be exercised only based on:
■the percentage of women in positions of responsibility at the end of 2024, out of the total holders of 
positions of responsibility, with a minimum of 25%, a target of 27% and a maximum of 28%; 
■the ratio of renewable electricity to electricity consumed 2024, with a minimum of 75%, a target of 80% 
and a maximum of 83% of electricity from renewable sources. 
The remaining 70% of the option rights may be exercised if the economic-financial parameter is achieved.
Benefits and welfare  constitute non-monetary elements of remuneration. 
In particular:
■benefits are goods and services made available to beneficiaries, depending on their role, and are aimed at 
improving their well-being; these goods and services generate an economic value separate from both fixed 
salary and other forms of variable remuneration;
■welfare is the package of non-monetary services available to the entire corporate population regardless of 
role, aimed at increasing individual and family well-being of all employees. 
Finally, with regard to the Broad-Based Share Ownership Plan launched in 2020, it should be noted that 126.3 
million shares were issued on November 27, 2020. Under the Plan Regulations, if the shares are held and the 
owner remains in employment - one year from the date of assignment - one free share (bonus share) is 
awarded for every three subscribed shares. Therefore, on December 3, 2021, having verified the two conditions 
mentioned above, 38,604,270 new shares were issued, with no capital increase.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1111 To provide accurate information on the relationship between Senior Management remuneration and that of the Company population [GRI 102-38], 
[GRI 102-39], in accordance with the "Policy for Information Classification and Management in terms of confidentiality", TIM provides some 
information, useful for the calculation, in the usual table form, in the Remuneration Report and in the Annual Financial Report.
2  The vesting period is the period between the time when the plan is assigned and the time when performance shares mature, corresponding to the 
financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022 for the 1st incentive cycle.
3 Contractual clause allowing variable remuneration paid to be recovered in the event that the disbursement was a result of willful misconduct or 
gross negligence of the executives involved, or in the event of a data formulation error that led to a Balance sheet restatement. For the 
2020-2022 LTI Plan, the claw-back clause is applied to all recipients.Below are the main types of objectives connected with sustainability present in the company MBO system.

Remuneration policy in Brazil
The Remuneration Policy in Brazil is aligned with the Group Policy and establishes the rules and principles for 
defining and developing remuneration in a competitive manner, according to market practices, in order to 
attract, engage, recognize and retain the human resources necessary to achieve the company’s strategic 
objectives, always in compliance with the corporate governance requirements for companies listed on the 
Brazilian stock exchange. The resulting remuneration structure must balance (fixed and variable) remuneration 
and expand the benefit system, aiming for sustainable long-term results for TIM.
The total compensation is composed of five elements:
1. Fixed remuneration : Its purpose is to recognize and reflect the scope and value of the position, both 
internally and externally, as well as the individual performance, experience, education and knowledge of 
managers.
2. Benefits : the objective is to offer products and services that increase the financial and social well-being of 
people and their families, acting on the value perceived by employees, for the purpose of attracting them 
and retaining them with the Company. The Company offers a large benefits package, capable of covering 
the various aspects of well-being, with admission criteria that may be specific or correlated with the 
employee’s level and position. Benefits evolve based on market practices and the trade union agreements 
for the specific categories, as well as the evolution of people’s expectations and needs. Several examples of 
benefits offered by the Company are: private pensions, extended maternity leave, extended paternity and 
wedding leave, healthcare coverage, dental care coverage, life insurance, childcare assistance and meal 
vouchers. The company also offers its employees the option to personalize their benefits packages to best 
meet their needs through a flexible benefits platform. In 2021, the company continued investing in 
improving its range of benefits offered. The Dental Care plan was restructured, adding numerous plans to 
the portfolio and greater flexibility for each employee in choosing the plan most suited to his/her needs. 
The company also agreed with the trade unions on implementing a healthcare plan for all employees up 
to May 2022.
3. Variable component: Rewarding the achievement and outperformance of the company targets, in line 
with the budget, strategic planning and market practices. The objective of this instrument is to reach or 
outperform the organization’s targets and objectives defined in the three-year business plan presented to 
the market. The variable component, in turn, is divided into three groups, i.e.:
3.1 Short-term incentive:  MBO (Management By Objectives) is a short term variable remuneration 
program based on the concept of profit sharing, linked to the Company’s strategic business indicators, 
containing company as well as department-based purposes and objectives. Again in 2021, the MBO 
system establishes a threshold consisting of the EBITDA indicator as a condition of access to the bonus 
applied equally to all recipients of the plan. For 2021, the weight of the strictly departmental targets 
remained low in favor of the company targets. The business objectives are tied to financial and 
operative challenges and some are linked to ESG topics: Customer Satisfaction Index, Employee 
Engagement and Management Gender Salary Gap, both assigned to 100% of participants.
3.2 Bonus (one-off):  The bonus is an instrument based on the assessment of individual performance, 
which may be used to recognize exceptional performance as well as reward the results of specific 
initiatives and projects relevant for the Company.
3.3 Long-term incentive: TIM’s long-term incentive plan is share-based, and aims at: (i) achieving 
alignment between the top management's interests and those of shareholders, through participation 
in the business risk; (ii) implementing an integrated incentive systems, to balance the time horizon with 
the nature of the targets; (iii) increasing the competitive nature of the benefits package and (iv) 
increasing the loyalty of the Company’s key resources. In May 2021, the Board of Directors approved 
the 2021 Grant for the 2021-2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan, with a vesting period of three years. This 
Plan is reserved to the Chief Executive Officer, the Deputy Chairman and the holders of strategic 
positions that have a greater impact on the business results. The Long-Term Incentive Plan combines 
two methods: Restricted Shares, subordinate to the participant remaining with the Company for a 
specific period, and Performance Shares, subordinate to the achievement of specific targets and the 
participant remaining with the Company for a certain period. The performance objectives are linked to 
economic/financial indicators and/or share performance metrics (for example: Total Shareholder 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 112Return). The number of shares may increase or decrease based on the performance and the 
assignment of dividends, if any, taking account of the criteria set out in each Allocation.
4. Hiring/retention bonus: In analyzing the conditions of the market, the context and the business challenges 
and, in order to guarantee business continuity and the achievement of the strategic plan, the company 
may offer to pay a one-off bonus to guarantee the hiring and/or retention of people in key positions. Hiring 
bonuses specifically allow for more attractive offers to be made to external candidates and reduce to the 
minimum occasional losses that may arise in personnel changing companies.
5. Severance pay : This refers to amounts and conditions, either legal or complementary in nature, to be 
provided in the event of termination of the employment relationship with the Company.
The definition of the structure and amounts is supported by the analysis of market practices, mainly on the 
high-tech and telecommunications markets, as well as of companies of similar size and governance (part of 
the Novo Mercado at the Brazilian Stock Exchange, or listed on the New York Stock Exchange, etc.); it is 
updated annually, in line with changes in the market and the Company’s strategic planning. The methodology 
entails the analysis of remuneration applied in the market (fixed, variable, benefits, fees for participating in 
committees, etc.), considering the benchmark companies and the analyses conducted by companies 
specializing in remuneration (Korn Ferry Hay Group, Willis Towers Watson, etc.). The comparisons take 
account of the various statistics available (median, average, 3rd quartile, etc.). Total Compensation considers 
the importance of the role held by the employee in the organizational structure, based on market parameters. 
The elements Fixed Remuneration, Variable Remuneration and Benefits are weighed based on the assessment 
of the work and the combination of positions.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 113Industrial Relations
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 402]  The 2021 materiality analysis confirmed “Managing employment 
relationships” as a material topic for the whole Group. [GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 402] TIM has 
always entertained open and transparent relationships with trade unions and workers’ representatives, in the 
belief that it is only through continuous, constructive dialog that the best possible balance can be struck with 
respect to the expectations of all stakeholders. 
[GRI 102-41]  All Group workers, both in Italy and in Brazil, are covered by Collective Labor Agreements reached 
with trade union organizations and all personnel are guaranteed the possibility of attending union meetings, in 
terms of paid leave and company space to enable them to be held, as well as of freely participating in 
consultation procedures for the election of trade union representatives. In no Group operations is the right to 
union participation at risk or disputed. Amongst other things, union agreements lay down the ways in which 
these rights can be enforced and establish the bodies in charge of controlling compliance therewith. 
[GRI 402-1]  The minimum notification period for operational changes is governed by the collective agreements 
applied to all TIM employees. TIM takes care to listen to and engage with workers' representatives, including 
through reorganization processes. 
[GRI 408-1], [GRI 409-1] Collaboration with workers’ representatives, together with internal control systems and 
procedures, has ensured that no violation or risk has been reported with regards to the application of the 
Group’s Social Responsibility policies protecting the essential employment rights, such as the ban on forced or 
child labor1.
The Industrial Relations model 
The structure of TIM’s current industrial relations model, formalized with the trade unions, is aimed at 
enhancing collaboration on matters required by law and collective bargaining, in the areas of information, 
consultation and negotiation, both at national and regional level.  
[GRI 407] At a local level, there is a widespread presence of trade union representatives in all the Italian 
regions, which fosters active decentralized participation allowing the specific regional needs and opportunities 
to be better understood and combined by both parties. Today, around 400 TIM people hold the office of trade 
union representative. In addition to the protections and rights provided by law and the national collective 
bargaining agreement for the telecommunications sector, TIM grants specific prerogatives to union 
representatives in the company, as defined by company agreements in force at the time. TIM S.p.A.'s 
unionization rate recorded in December 2021 was 38% (around 13,926 registered employees).
Due to the organizational complexity and multi-regional presence, trade union representatives elected a 
national representative body, called the National Trade Union Representatives Coordinator, delegated to 
manage negotiations with the company for matters of a national nature.
The industrial relations system is set up with a focus on preventive phases of information and union 
discussions, also through specific corporate bodies (in the form of permanent joint commissions) with the task 
of the technical development of specific subjects such as training and occupational health and safety, welfare 
and equal opportunities.
Management of the various stages of the COVID-19 health emergency
In a situation of extreme difficulty for our country, following the epidemiological emergency caused by 
COVID-19, TIM managed the inevitable unforeseen repercussions by taking specific action in accordance with 
government provisions. The company committed itself to reconciling the different needs in this new and 
dynamic context, with the dual aim of protecting the health of people and the country and ensuring business 
continuity.
Consequently, in order to continue working and limit the chances of infection, remote work was quickly 
extended to 36,000 employees in the domestic market, 6,400 personal computers were immediately 
distributed and software solutions developed to allow the use of personal PCs/tablets pending completion of 
the planned company equipment plan. For TIM people unable to work from home (e.g. “on-field” technicians, 
specialists who manage the equipment), specific forms of flexibility were identified and all the measures and 
equipment to work safely were provided. 
At the end of April 2020 TIM and the trade unions, with the common goal of safeguarding the health of all 
workers, signed a memorandum of understanding relating to the management of the second phase of the 
COVID-19 emergency, in order to identify the most suitable measures to deal with the health emergency, as 
well as the guidelines and consequent measures to be implemented. The guidelines, drawn up with the 
collaboration of experts, change the way work was organized in order to ensure maximum protection for the 
people involved, in compliance with the provisions issued by the relevant government and health authorities 
for a gradual return to work by geographical region and organization.
In August 2021, a Survey was sent to all employees in which they were given the opportunity to choose to 
return to the office on a voluntary basis:
■gradually returning to the office starting from October 4 (1 day a week for the daily plan and 1 week a 
month for the weekly plan),
■choosing to continue working in agile mode for 5 days a week, initially until December 31, 2021, an option 
subsequently extended to March 31, 2022.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1141 [GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 408]  In terms of child labor, the policies allow for some completely legal exceptions, such as, for example, 
training contracts for which incentives are provided by the Brazilian government.Agile Working
Agile working was already part of TIM's DNA. Our plan was launched in 2016. 
Before the pandemic, 21,000 people could already choose to work once a week remotely, with very flexible 
working hours and the opportunity to independently organize daily activities. 
The emergency expanded the use of agile working, making it necessary to work from home for 5 consecutive 
days a week.
We reacted quickly to this change, enabling remote work even for activities that had not previously been 
regarded as remotable, such as Customer Care. 
To do this, new software was provided along with kits to allow installation and connection to corporate 
platforms, with simple and streamlined digital instruction manuals available to allow colleagues to have the 
same tools they used in the office, all in record time, guaranteeing everyone a laptop in addition to the latest 
generation smartphone with unlimited data and voice traffic already included, as well as videoconferencing 
platforms, digitized archives and document sharing environments.
Furthermore, discounts were provided on fiber connections for everyone, as well as free WIFI modems for 
people who are in direct contact with customers.
In order to support and encourage this important job change and put everyone in a position to make the best 
use of the tools provided, an ad hoc training course on Agile Work was also organized for managers and 
employees.
The use of these digital tools allowed them to continue their work by moving meetings, events, and training 
courses completely online, so as to avoid travel, business trips and contacts that could have turned into 
dangerous opportunities for the virus to spread. 
Now, however, we need to leave the emergency behind us and develop new organizational models to enhance 
flexibility, balancing on-site and remote work, in order to allow personal independence and responsibility to 
coexist with the sharing and socializing opportunities we all need (and enjoy).
In August 2020, an important trade union agreement was signed which, in addition to providing for the 
working methods used in a transitional period in which the emergency still exists, governs a new TIM 
Organizational Work Model based on alternating work inside and outside the company premises. The 
agreement is based on two models depending on the organizational areas of the roles covered: one provides 
for 1 week in the office and 1 of agile working, while the other provides for 3 days in the office and 2 of agile 
working within the same week.
Work can be done anywhere outside the office, provided that the premises are not open to the public and have 
a good level of connectivity, while desk sharing applies for days spent in the office: workers can book their own 
work station for the days spent in the office and make use of the appropriate rooms and spaces provided for 
them to meet with other colleagues while having the opportunity to concentrate for individual work. 
Important modernization work is being completed in various locations throughout Italy to create premises 
which, once the emergency and the need to maintain social distancing are over, allow people to share ideas 
and work efficiently.
The voluntary nature of the arrangement however remains firm under this Model. Employees are in fact free 
not to participate and to work on site for 5 days a week.
The right to disconnect was duly considered in designing this form of agile work with the trade unions. TIM 
operates around the clock because it operates public utility services, therefore applying “automatic” 
disconnection systems is unthinkable. A decision was therefore taken to use the reverse approach: 2 time 
bands were established (2.5 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the afternoon) when everyone - both in the 
office and remotely - must be on duty and available for meetings, handovers or prompt communications. For 
the rest of the day, each person is free to state their period of availability/unavailability using the Skype for 
Business application, managing their breaks independently and flexibly.
The campaign to sign up to the new agile working Model took place between December and January and the 
new arrangements will come into effect as soon as the social distancing requirements are lifted. A very high 
number of people whose work is compatible with the working arrangement signed up, representing 93% of 
workers across the country. This shows that people appreciate this new way of working that allows them to 
get the most out of working remotely and on-site.  
Agreement 04/23/2021
In April 2021, TIM met the National and Local Trade Unions, together with the National Trade Union 
Coordination Office, and signed an agreement that identified actions and tools to support TIM's digital 
transformation and achieve the objectives set out in the plan, while at the same time establishing measures to 
value the professional contribution made by people.
The main contents of the agreement are the following:
Agreement on the Expansion Contract 
The agreement - which is preliminary to the Expansion Contract being signed with the government - provided 
for the scheme to be applied for 16 months, during which a hiring plan would be implemented in 2021/2022, 
working hours reduced and a training plan implemented that focuses on reskilling and the development of 
new skills appropriate to the role.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 115Dynamics of professional structures and adaptation of individual working hours
Completion, between 2021 and 2023, of 1,450 promotions, which are additional to the 1,580 already planned 
for 2019-2021 by the agreement of July 18, 2019.
Furthermore, 550 promotions are planned in the same 3-year period for staff involved in "network and 
technological system design" activities.
25% increases in working hours are planned in 2021-2023 for a total of 400 part-time workers.
In addition to the Expansion Contract agreement illustrated above, a further agreement was signed - on the 
same date - for a one-off payment to be made to staff affected by the reduction in working hours envisaged 
by the Expansion Contract, payment of which will be made in bimonthly advances. The agreement also 
specifies the regulatory and contractual arrangements that will not be subject to re-proportioning as a result of 
the Expansion Agreement being applied.
The Expansion Contract
We are all aware of how important it is for the economic and social recovery for the production system to be 
able to govern technological innovation and service digitalization. The health emergency has made the need to 
accelerate the digitalization process of the country even more evident.
The macroeconomic context and the reference market as well as the outlines of the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan, 
with the related organizational implications, were presented by TIM S.p.A. on April 6, 2021, to the stipulating 
trade unions and to TIM's National RSU Coordination Office, highlighting, among other things, that the 
technological evolution and the fixed, mobile, cloud and data center infrastructures have been accelerated and 
strengthened by the partnerships launched with leading companies worldwide.
In this context, TIM deemed it necessary to continue with the process of renewing the professional mix of skills, 
strengthening the action already taken to support the process of technological transformation and the 
consequent reorganization plan, while promoting employability through the following specific actions, as 
provided for in the agreement of April 23 and formalized in the Expansion Contract signed with the 
government on May 17, 2021:
■launch of a recruitment program aimed at acquiring professional profiles consistent with the company 
reindustrialization/reorganization plan
■implementation - for the staff employed by the company - of dedicated training courses - to support the 
re-skilling and upskilling processes - aimed at adapting and developing skills in line with the thrust of 
technological innovation and aimed at enabling virtuous migration paths towards professions that allow a 
more rational use of resources
■the company has undertaken to ensure compliance with gender equality both in recruitment and in 
training courses
■reduction of working hours in line with the general purposes of the Contract.
Hirings 
During the two-year period 2020-2021, TIM intends to hire a total number of 650 resources. In 2021, 330 
resources were hired, and 320 will be hired in 2022 - with permanent contracts and professional profiles that 
are compatible with the company reorganization plan. The company also reserves the right to hire people on a 
professionalizing apprenticeship contract.
People will be hired in all company areas, technological and commercial, as well as support departments, with 
the aim of introducing the skills needed to launch the new services.
Training and retraining project
Through the Training and Retraining project, TIM aims to increase the value of human capital over time, 
operating in a socially responsible manner to ensure that the risk of discontinuity does not negatively impact 
the skills of workers as well as business activities.
The training and retraining project is always focused on the individual, their development and training.
The project guidelines are to update and evolve professional skills and core professions, in line with the goal of 
stabilizing and relaunching the domestic business; to acquire the knowledge and skills to cover the new 
professions required by the evolution of TIM's business and its entry into adjacent markets; to expand the 
number of people able to fill core and strategic roles.
Reductions in working hours
The reductions in working hours, with two distinct percentages (3.5% and 12.1%) differentiated by 
organizational structures, have been applied starting from May 24, 2021, for 16 months.
The reduction will not exceed 3,196 FTEs and will affect the whole company, with a few exclusions.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 116Industrial Relations activities in Brazil
In Brazil , TIM held a total of 22 meetings with the trade union representatives committee in 2021. The 
committee represents the country’s 27 trade unions.
During the first half of the year, the agreements on the profit-sharing program - PPR 2021 were negotiated 
with 2 negotiating cycles with each union federation. The rules of the program were negotiated, as well as its 
objectives, the Management Incentives program (MBO), as well as the maintenance of the targets for judging 
achievement of the results.
The negotiations of the collective labor agreements for 2021-2022 (supplementing the 2020-2022 Agreement 
in force) were concluded in November. The amendment aims to regulate salaries, benefits and the payment of 
salary bonuses. The renewal also achieved agreement on the profit sharing program for 2022. The proposal 
included the addition of new benefits (assistance and medical). The transfer of employees to FiberCO was also 
formalized, which guarantees that the resources involved will maintain their current TIM contractual 
conditions.
TIM S.A. maintained close relations with unions throughout the year, optimizing collective bargaining, worker 
representation and union freedom.
4.5% of employees are members of unions. Collective bargaining regarded 100% of employees
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 117Health and safety 
[GRI 103-1 : Management Approach] [GRI 403] The 2021 materiality analysis confirmed the protection of health 
and safety as a material topic for the entire Group. The GRI 403 indicators refer only to workers in the TIM 
Group.  
[GRI 103-2 : Management Approach] [GRI 403-1] Within Italy, the regulatory provisions for occupational health 
and safety, in addition to defining the necessary criteria for risk identification and assessment, provide that 
adequate participation and consultation of workers through the Workers’ Safety Representatives has been 
implemented. 
TIM ensures that the Company complies in full with national legislation and agreements reached with trade 
unions; it also establishes numerous initiatives aimed at ensuring comparison tables are put in place to 
maintain high safety standards.
[GRI 403-1] TIM’s Safety Management System Model involves the full involvement of all players that participate 
in the safety process: company management, operational coordination figures, appointed doctors, workers 
and Workers’ Safety Representatives (WSR). 
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach]  In order to supplement and strengthen these initiatives, a new 
management system that complies with the recognized standards (ISO 45001) is being implemented that 
covers all the processes relating to office and mixed use property assets under the responsibility of the Real 
Estate department.
[GRI 403-2] The identification and assessment of risks found at the Company, which is the priority activity of 
the preventive actions, is ensured through constant oversight of company processes and their evolution in 
close connection with the management lines. These activities are performed by specialized internal staff 
capable of conducting instrumental analyses and surveys on safety in the workplace (high and low frequency 
electromagnetic fields, noise, vibrations, natural radioactivity, lighting, micro-climate, manual handling of 
loads, etc.). Work activities are classified at low and medium risk levels, in line with the ATECO classification 
criteria of the National Institute of Statistics. There are no high-risk activities carried out at TIM S.p.A. or at the 
other Group associates.
The control measures applied to eliminate or contain the risks include:
■numerous health and safety training programs, differentiated according to the risks and professional 
profiles found at the Company;
■the latest generation of personal and/or collective protective equipment and devices, often designed ad 
hoc in collaboration with the most important multi-nationals on the market;
■any organizational arrangements implemented in collaboration with the departments, which can 
guarantee an acceptable level of risk, where it cannot be eliminated.
The most significant performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of the actions adopted include the 
outcomes of the accidents analysis, which generates improvement plans defined on the basis of the causes 
that led to the events and that can lead to the updating of the Company’s risk assessment.
In this context, the “Health, Safety & Environment” (HSE) department supports Company organization in the 
management of health, safety and environmental issues by assessing risks and identifying the most 
appropriate prevention and protection measures and in line with technological development. 
The COVID-19 pandemic emergency had an impact on all prevention and protection activities, changing the 
intervention priorities. Some actions were reviewed to ensure that everyone in the company was protected 
from the main health risk of contagion.
The following actions were also taken:
■ongoing information and awareness campaign aimed at all staff;
■flu vaccination campaign in fall 2021;
■specific procedures for dealing a proven or suspected positive status.
[GRI 403-3] The monitoring campaigns that use instruments to measure physical phenomena: indoor/outdoor 
noise, electromagnetic fields and ionizing radiation, vibrations, outdoor/indoor micro-climate parameters 
lighting, which in 2020 were suspended and rescheduled, due to the closure of sites as a result of the 
pandemic, were relaunched in 2021, where possible.
With reference to accidents, careful analysis of events and, where necessary, potential identification of 
corrective actions continued with the direct involvement of the lines affected and of the HR department for 
greater synergy. Expansion of the pilot project for detecting and managing near misses1 continues. In 2021, it 
involved 50% of on-field engineers (around 3,500 people) of the Chief Technology & Operations Office, with 
detection work also launched for workers assigned to Real Estate
GRI 403-4]  The number and method of designation or election of workers’ safety representatives, together with 
the salaried working hours and the tools used to fulfill their duties are agreed during the collective bargaining 
process. The corporate relationship model in terms of safety, which has always been based on participation 
logic, includes about 80 Representatives throughout the country, who support five committees made up of a 
mix of company/trade union members with specific workers’ health and safety functions. These Committees 
present at national and local level, according to the agreements stipulated with the trade union organizations, 
play a participatory and collaborative role aimed at guaranteeing joint analyses and discussion by the 
company party and the union party of all matters relating to health and safety at work, on a national and local

ASSILT (supplementary healthcare association for the employees of TIM Group companies), funded by the 
Group companies, by employee members and retired members, is a non-profit-making organization providing 
services to its members and beneficiaries that are supplementary to those provided by the Italian national 
health service, including -together with public healthcare establishments -collective and individual research, 
knowledge-gathering initiatives and health prevention activities, and the promotion of health education 
initiatives to protect the health and physical well-being of its members. In 2021, the Association disbursed 
refunds totaling approximately 23 million euros. As of December 31, 2021, 79,000 people were registered with 
the Association, including 39,000 employees and 33,000 pensioners. In 2021 Assilt disbursed grants to its 
members of over 23 million euros.
ASSIDA provides senior management staff with refunds for the cost of supplementary health services to those 
provided by the Italian national health service. At December 31, 2021, the Association had 1,698 beneficiaries 
and 523 registered managers and had disbursed approximately 1.3 million euros.
[GRI 403-7]  TIM guarantees the fulfillment of all legal OSH obligations that have an impact on its customers

In 2021, accidents at work decreased by approximately 4% at TIM Group level. The "frequency" index, slightly 
increasing, is conditioned by the reduction in the number of hours worked, while the "severity" and 
"unproductivity" indexes were impacted by the increase in the average duration of accidents, which rose from 
37 days to around 40 days. The trend in accidents in the three-year period 2019–2021 saw a sharp decrease in 
the number of events, specifically in 2020 (-45%). 
There were no fatal accidents at work in 2021. Details on the accidents, occupational diseases and absences 
required by the GRI [GRI 403-2]  standard are given in the Appendix to this chapter.
The main types of accidents identified were, in descending order: personal falls, traffic accidents, sprains/pulled 
muscles, shocks, injuries resulting from materials/equipment handling, crushing, injury from falling objects and 
other types of minor accidents. 
In TIM S.p.A., to ensure correct management of accident events, a procedure has been put in place describing 
the rules and requirements of each subject in the “genesis” process, the management and closure of reports of 
incidents at work and/or while traveling involving workers for which companies are required to pay an INAIL 
premium2.
[GRI 403-10] Occupational diseases
With regard to occupational diseases, complaints submitted to INAIL (National Institute for Insurance against 
Accidents at Work) relating to employees in the reference year and subject to recognition procedures were 
taken into account. 
In 2021, 5 complaints were filed in connection with employees (14 cases in 2020, 12 in 2019) regarding 
musculoskeletal, respiratory and auditory system diseases.
[GRI 403-4] In Brazil , collective agreements usually provide for a duty to provide information on the prevention 
of accidents at work and occupational diseases, and TIM complies with this procedure.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 403-1] In Brazil, there is a broad regulatory framework governing 
Health, Safety and Environment issues at federal, state and even municipal level, which requires constant 
monitoring of new developments on the subject. Since 2020, there has been great expectation of legislative 
changes, particularly as regards health and safety, as the current federal government wishes to reduce the 
bureaucracy involved with a view to stimulating the creation of jobs. TIM is therefore willing to adapt the 
processes to any legal change, amongst others taking part in commissions guided by the union to which, 
together with other telecommunications companies, it adheres, in order to take part in a legal review process, 
which may directly impact our sector, such as, for example, legislation governing electricity and overhead 
works.
In light of the foregoing, all work programs in 2020 and 2021 were focused on adapting internal regulations for 
the legislative review, notably taking into account the company’s commitment to comply with current 
legislation; however the COVID-19 pandemic has led the federal government to suspend its review programs in 
2020 to then gradually resume them in 2021. Therefore, only very specific subjects, less than envisaged, have 
changed.
Despite the events, since early 2020, high quality work has been done for the company, which continued in 
2021, [GRI 403-2] [GRI 403-7], including the inspection of all TIM buildings for the production of mandatory 
reports, such as the PPRA (Environmental Risk Prevention Program), the Report on Construction 
Infrastructures, the Report on Accessibility, the Recording of Carbon Monoxide Emissions produced by GMGs 
(generators) and the identification of structures still in use in which asbestos-containing materials are present.
Since the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Health, Safety & Environment work has needed to be rapidly 
changed to supply employees, third parties, families and communities with all the technical support necessary 
to address the emergency. Various different planning, communication and monitoring activities have been 
carried out, as well as technical studies of products and services and support actions for the various areas 
involved, with more than three thousand people monitored by the Department, without including the 
employees working from home.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1202 National institute for insurance covering accidents at work.Great progress has also been made in the area of documentation, with the review and update of the various 
regulatory documents for which the area is responsible.
Furthermore, audits and/or inspections are regularly carried out to assess the effectiveness of prevention 
measures in the processes and workplaces with a view to continually improving health and safety conditions. 
The HSE (Health Safety & Environment) team numbers 28 members, distributed strategically throughout the 
regional sites of TIM Brasil.
The Department focuses on monitoring the technical and support developments, not only to guarantee the 
health and well-being of everyone, but also to verify compliance with good practices, as demonstrated by the 
certifications.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 121People Caring 
TIM's welfare model combines tradition and future with specific strategic and organizational awareness, which 
places welfare at the heart of the Human Resources strategy, enabling the use of services and initiatives aimed 
at encouraging company, family and social sustainability. The emergency linked to the spread of COVID-19 
required the company to show a spirit of responsibility, attention, caution and adaptation to the global 
pandemic scenario. TIM is committed to tackling the virus and making it possible for everyone to continue 
working, in safety and with increased workability. TIM's welfare system therefore revolves around the well-
being of individuals, considering their day as a whole, the fine lines between working life and private life in this 
global scenario, taking into account the burdens of care placed upon them in their working and non-working 
life, with an awareness that organizational well-being is closely related to people's satisfaction and 
engagement and therefore performance.
The plan has been called "For TIM Citizens" and includes initiatives aimed at ensuring personal and 
organizational well-being, helping people to work and live better in the company as part of TIM’s even broader 
Sustainability Plan. The main areas of TIM’s Welfare Plan are described below.
Listening 
The internal listening plan takes the form of qualitative and quantitative periodic internal surveys1 to record the 
needs, requirements, experiences and perceptions of TIM's people. Engagement is the real development driver 
of TIM, which, through inclusion, care and constant listening intends to support and assist TIM’s employees in 
their professional experience. Surveys such as the Engagement Survey and the Welfare Survey, in synergy with 
the plans for direct, informal meetings, contribute to developing and constantly improving welfare services.
People Caring for people and families
People Caring initiatives, primarily focused on the work-life balance, are the first pillar of TIM’s welfare, based 
on the belief that performance and organizational well-being are connected to each other and to the 
organization of family and work life. Promoting a balance between work and private life is essential for all TIM 
employees in the three different dimensions of their lives: work, family, personal. The main people caring 
initiatives for people and families implemented in 2021 include: 
■Special Welfare:  TIM offers its employees the chance to convert their performance bonus into a series of 
tax-free welfare goods and services, which can be used as follows: refunded services, vouchers, shopping 
vouchers or payment to the Complementary Pension Fund.
■Discount Agreements & Promos:  TIM’s employees have the chance to access various discount agreements, 
which are continuously being updated, including banking, insurance, rentals, fair trade, health, education 
and mobility. CRALT (the Corporate Recreational Club for the Workers of the Telecom Italia Group) 
agreements that offer services at various kinds of commercial establishments across the country are also 
active.
■TIM Estate (TIM Summer): an initiative aimed at the children of employees, allowing them to enjoy summer 
vacations full of entertainment, sports, art, nature and educational guidance.  In 2021, the initiative took 
place again but with a mixture of online and face-to-face activities, overcoming the restrictions set by the 
pandemic through an extraordinary program of additional security measures, managing to accommodate 
all the applications received. 
■MioNido (MyNursery) and MiaMaterna (MyKindergarten) : To promote a good work-life balance and improve 
the quality of life in the company, TIM provides 7 kindergartens and 1 nursery school within company 
headquarters for employees’ children aged between 3 months and 6 years. In March 2020, following the 
COVID-19 emergency, the company’s kindergartens and nursery school were closed temporarily. The 
reopening, initially scheduled for October 2021, was then postponed to 2022 due to the potential 
continuation of remote working until the end of 2021.
■MioRimborso (MyRefund) : Colleagues with children aged between 3 months and 6 years who attend state, 
private, municipal childcare facilities or use babysitting services are entitled to a refund based on the 
income bracket declared. 
■Refund of university fees:  TIM and its Group companies refund the fees paid by employees to register their 
children for university degree courses, including bachelor, master’s and combined degree courses. Around 
700 colleagues were reimbursed in 2021.
■Foreign study (Intercultura) bursaries:  An initiative that provides the most deserving children of employees 
with scholarships to study abroad. 38 scholarships were used in 2021.
■TIM Studio:  From April to June 2021, thanks to the partnership with  ALATEL  (the Association of retirees and 
workers of the Telecom Italia Group), within the experimental "Assistance for remote study" project, TIM 
offered support and specialized supplementary training for lower and upper secondary school students, 
intended to support their integration in school and strengthen their preparation. The pilot project involved 
65 young people who are the children or grandchildren of TIM employees. The teachers were all volunteer 
ALATEL members, who were assisted by volunteers from TIM. The second edition started in early 
November with the involvement of about 70 young people.
■Support for parents & caregivers : MultiMe, the digital Life-Based Learning program that promotes and 
disseminates experience of care of children or of an elderly parent, was launched. In September 2021, 
training courses began for the colleagues that set up profiles on the platform, based on their carer roles. 
Also in September 2021, the “Profession: Parents” initiative was launched to offer guidance and tools for 
parents and their children.
■Elder care : considering the socio-demographic evolution of TIM's people, the elder and fragile care needs 
have increased. The first initiative taken to respond to these new needs is the launch of the TIM Care 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1221 The main surveys are: Engagement Survey, Great Place to Work, Welfare Survey and TIMinAscoltoplatform, which supports caregivers by offering services such as family assistance at home (home care, 
professional caregiver, transport services and aids), assistance for retirement homes or day centers (all 
private facilities) and support at various levels (administrative, legal, economic, psychological).
■Subsidies : The company provides financial assistance to colleagues or families of colleagues who are in 
particularly disadvantaged financial situations. 
Wellbeing
for TIM, the well-being of its people is essential to create a peaceful and collaborative work environment, in 
which its employees feel happy and free to express themselves and ensure their happiness in their professional 
and personal life. For this reason, in 2019 TIM created the Well-Being Project, a set of initiatives and training 
courses specifically focused on stress reduction, the promotion of exercise and physical activity, improvements 
in lifestyles and health prevention. Moreover, the TIMmyHealth service has been identified in association with 
TIM myBroker  (the new insurance brokerage company wholly-owned by TIM). This is a Health Assistance policy 
that provides complete health care for the whole family and offers a telemedicine service. 
Diversity and Inclusion
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 405] [GRI 406] [GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 405] [GRI 406] 
[GRI 405]  Particularly in this context, inclusion is therefore a key area of TIM’s welfare system, but also the 
most challenging one, and it is no coincidence that it is also considered a profoundly identity-based and 
strategic lever. In fact, it clearly permeates all founding documents of the new organizational identity: from the 
Ethics Code to the Human Rights Policy and values. TIM's management Diversity & Inclusion program aims to 
implement a concrete, sustainable and long-term vision for the company, guaranteeing equal opportunities, 
inclusion and the promotion of and full respect for diversity for all of the TIM Group's people. TIM's journey 
towards inclusion began in 2009, when a Diversity Manager was appointed and a Diversity Board set up.  Over 
the years, the Diversity Manager position has evolved to become the Diversity & Inclusion Manager and 
subsequently the Diversity, Inclusion & Disability Manager, with broader responsibilities.
The Engagement Survey showed that inclusion is one of the main drivers for getting people engaged. Inclusion 
also plays a key role in knowing how to innovate the products and services offered; anticipating market needs 
actually means going beyond the limits often generated by work routines and habits to look at the activities, 
processes and people from a unique point of view. 
In 2021, TIM was once again included in the Top 100 of the Refinitiv Diversity and Inclusion Index, the most 
respected world ranking in this field, for the third year running, making it the top Italian company and top 
telecoms company in the world. TIM’s place in the Refinitiv Diversity and Inclusion Index confirms the Group’s 
commitment to equal opportunities, non-discrimination and inclusion as the basis of its company strategy to 
improve internal expertise, organizational well-being and therefore company performance.
In 2021, for the fourth consecutive year, TIM was also included in the Top 20 of the Diversity Brand Index, which 
lists the brands perceived to be most inclusive, and for the first time among the virtuous companies according 
to Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index.
The “TIM4inclusion” community has also been set up in TIM to promote inclusion, with over 400 colleagues 
involved for knowledge management and sharing in relation to these matters. Solutions are proposed within 
this community, from a planning perspective, in order to overcome all kinds of barriers.
Lastly, TIM has clearly expressed its views on inclusion issues, by adding a specific reference to the main 
organizational identity documents: code of ethics, human rights policy, charter of values and leadership model.
The main areas of development for TIM’s Diversity & Inclusion Management plan are: 
■Cultural dissemination and awareness:  since 2020 TIM has promoted “4 Weeks 4 Inclusion”, an inter-
company initiative which, in 2021, involved over 200 companies, with over 500,000 participants, who were 
able to enjoy a rich calendar of 4 weeks of shared digital events, including webinars, digital labs and 
creative groups dedicated to inclusion. 
■Training : in 2021, a major training and awareness-raising plan was launched for Top and Middle 
Management across 5 strands of D&I. Moreover, training courses were initiated for everyone at the 
company, on inclusive language, gender biases and different areas of disability (dyslexia, neurodiversity, 
sensory disabilities, learning about disability, etc.). Every fifteen days, targeted content is offered on the 
company intranet  about the TIM D&I plan, as well as food for thought on inclusion.
■Disability management : there are 1,315 employees with disabilities in the domestic BU, accounting for 
about 3% of the average workforce in the reporting period2. The following have been made available for 
these employees to have a positive work day:
•the automatic workstation adaptation policy was extended in 2019 to cover disabling chronic diseases 
as well;
•solutions to improve communication between deaf and hearing employees3; 
•the activities of the working capital accelerators that assist several disability project start-ups4
•support for employees’ children with disabilities during TIM Summer camps;
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1232 There are 222 employees with disabilities in Brazil , which is just over 2% of the average annual 2021 Brazilian workforce.3 TIM offers the LIS interpreting service in the key moments of interaction between manager and employee, subtitles in main communications on 
the Intranet, specific e-mail inboxes, as well as free video calling services and an integrated communication platform developed internally, which 
can be used both from smartphones and desktop computers.
4 For example: the service provided by Pedius, a TIM WCAP incubated start-up that is a leading provider of support services to assist with 
communication for deaf people. The service contributes to improving the flow of communications between deaf colleagues and their supervisors 
and colleagues.•the “ Nessuno Escluso ” [None Excluded] project, created in 2021, aimed at providing specific IT 
equipment for everyone with a disability.
•Also in 2021, TIM was certified by the Italian Dyslexia Association (AID) as a “Dyslexia Friendly 
Company” for the work it has done to revise its communication, development, training, selection and 
human resources management processes in order to make them accessible also to people with 
learning disorders.
•the “ Cervelli Ribelli ” (Rebellious minds”) project to raise awareness of neurodiversity matters among all 
TIM people, including based on the stories of the people themselves and their families.
■Gender : TIM is a Valore D  partner, both as a supporting member and a member of the Board of Directors. 
Because of this, more than 100 female employees a year have the opportunity to attend skill-building 
courses, mentoring and coaching programs, as well as courses and workshops on welfare and work-life 
balance5. The “Progetto Donna ” [Woman Project] project continued in 2021. This represents TIM's 
commitment to increasing the culture of equal opportunities and accelerating the professional growth of 
women in the company. As part of the project, which is included in the “Per i Cittadini di TIM ” [For TIM 
People] Plan, surveys were conducted to raise awareness of the prejudices we all unknowingly hold, and 
the e-learning course on gender biases was launched, which involved administration of the Harvard 
Implicit Test. The Woman Project also includes “ LeadHERship al femminile ” (Female leadHERship), a cycle 
of 7 role model meetings in partnership with Valore D; the partnership with Young Women Network, the 
non-profit networking association for young women, of which 224 women in the TIM Group have been 
made members; coaching and mentorship programs targeting a pool of talented women. A project started 
in 2020 was also expanded in 2021: TIM against gender-related and sexual harassment and bullying. In 
addition to the policy for reporting and handling harassment incidents through the reporting channels 
(whistleblowing, reporting to managers or to the HR manager), it is now possible to take advantage of free 
psychological and legal advice and support from the Person of Trust, a figure outside the company, for 
guidance. Mandatory paternity leave has finally been doubled to encourage the sharing of parental and 
family roles: for all new dads, TIM adds an extra 10 days to the 10 days provided for by the Budget Law, for 
a total of 20 days.
■Age management:  the average age in the Group is just over 48 (and 22 years of seniority), rising in the 
parent company to a value of 52 years (and 27 years of seniority). TIM therefore launched the “Longevity 
Project” in 2021, which offers an action-packed plan to overcome age-related stereotypes and fully engage 
more senior personnel. The Longevity project is intended as a pathway for “Ageless talents,” based on two 
important building blocks: 1) the “Work Drivers Map” survey, which almost all TIM Citizens completed in 
late 2020, to assess Motivation and Employability and draw up personalized action plans; 2) definition of 
the “Longevity Worker” profile, consolidated through internal listening, based on which new policies, 
training programs and development actions will be implemented. Project objectives: to foster dialog 
between generations and promote everyone’s contribution, while respecting the diversity offered by people 
of all ages working at the company.
■Sexual orientation and gender identity:  TIM is a founding member of Parks - Liberi e Uguali, and a 
member of the BoD, a support which has been consolidated over the years. Thanks to the partnership with 
Parks, TIM has drawn up policies to encourage the inclusion of LGBT+ individuals in the company, with the 
extension of policies, benefits and leaves of absence:
•social identity policy allowing everyone, including transsexual people, to have a social identity that they 
feel best reflects who they are;
•non-routine healthcare for transsexual people or courses of assisted fertilization for gay colleagues;
•extension of the concept of “Family for TIM” to those of the “registered family household,” a 
development that allows all new families, including those with same-sex parents, to be recognized and 
have access to welfare services.
■Employee volunteering initiatives: these are an integral part of TIM’s inclusion management program, 
since they promote coming together and improving listening and comprehension skills and, indeed, 
inclusion. The main voluntary activities include:
•remote adoption:  1,502 Group employees have renewed their commitment to helping CIAI6, the 
Community of Sant’Egidio and Save the Children, giving their support to remote adoption of children, 
with a total contribution of around 1,550,000 euros;  
•blood donation: TIM incentivizes donating blood with specific campaigns and donation days at 
company offices. In 2021, 3,190 employees donated blood, for a total of 6,768 donations; 
•solidarity leave:  TIM makes it possible for their employees to transfer their leave to other colleagues in 
difficulty. 1,614 hours of solidarity leave were traded in 2021;
•banchetti della solidarietà (Solidarity Stalls):  the traditional stalls set up by non-profit organizations 
at company offices were suspended in 2021 and replaced with an internet event “Banchetti Solidali 
Digital Edition” (Solidarity Stalls Digital Edition), which provided space to 4 non-profit organizations, 
reaching 4,900 employees. 
Other initiatives for employees 
To promote employee personal and family well-being through enhanced investments, TIM has put in place a 
company loan scheme for predefined reasons for all Group personnel. 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1245 TIM has also joined the Women’s Employment Manifesto, a document whereby it is committed to 9 areas of activity.
6 Italian Center for Childhood Aid.To support preventative staff health care, TIM provides all those who are 45 years of age or older, the chance 
to join a flexible and personalized health prevention program every two years.
The aforementioned ASSILT (Association for supplementary health care for workers of TIM Group companies) 
and ASSIDA.
TELEMACO is the national complementary pension fund for employees in the telecommunications industry, 
established in 1998 as a non-profit association and operative since October 2000; its objective is to ensure that 
those subscribing are able to maintain their standard of living when retiring, thanks to the creation of 
supplementary social security, over and above the public provisions. It is intended for workers, office staff and 
middle managers of companies that apply the national telecommunications contract, for employees on 
permanent, apprenticeship or placement contracts and for people who are physically supported by the workers 
subscribing to the Fund. As of January 1, 2022, there were 30,389 employees subscribed to Telemaco, from 8 
associated companies with active members.
[GRI 401-2]  All Group workers, whether full or part-time, on permanent or fixed-term contracts, enjoy the same 
benefits, whilst, in Italy, the supplementary welfare institute is extended to workers on apprenticeship or 
placement contracts, as well as to employees on permanent contracts.
CRALT is the recreational club for employees of the TIM Group which organizes sight-seeing, sports, cultural 
and recreational activities for its members, employees, pensioners and their families. By entering into specific 
agreements, CRALT also allows members and their families to purchase goods and services at particularly 
good prices, which can also be settled in instalments. One of the most significant of these is the agreement 
and the resulting contribution provided for the purchase of school and university books for the children of 
members, as a valuable contribution to household purchasing power. 
As of December 31, 2021, there were 35,565 members, including 30,216 employees and 5,349 pensioners. As of 
December 31, the company’s contribution for the services provided came to around 1.4 million euros, equal to 
16% of the value of CRALT’s initiatives.
Inclusion Management in Brazil
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 405]  TIM S.A.  continued to pursue the objective of disseminating an 
inclusive culture within the company and Society, based on the Diversity & Inclusion Plan (D&I), in the belief 
that great diversity within a group corresponds to an equally great exchange of experiences and solutions that 
contribute to creating a healthy work environment and achieving a competitive advantage on the market. 
Various initiatives were developed throughout 2021, as described in the following chapters. As a result of the 
company’s ongoing efforts, in 2021 TIM received an important award in the sector, as the first company to win 
the Diversity in Tech award, issued by the GSMA Global Mobile Awards Association, for companies that make 
D&I a strategic priority. Moreover, the positioning of TIM S.A. led to an extraordinary result in the Refinitiv Index, 
one of the leading D&I indexes at global level. TIM was recognized as the top company in Brazil, the number 
one telecommunications company in the world for the Refinitiv Diversity & Inclusion Index and number 
nineteen, considering the global market as a whole.
Since the establishment (in 2019) of the People Caring and Inclusion Management Area within the Human 
Resources and Organization Department, TIM continuously makes investments to disseminate a more 
inclusive culture in the company and within all of Brazilian society, in line with the wider strategy of the 
Company ESG Plan. 
The plan is hinged on the 5 pillars of diversity and inclusion and the related undertakings: 
■Gender :  TIM continued its action on gender equality targets, setting the Target, included in the ESG Plan, 
of 35% women in leadership positions by 2023 as well as a specific target regarding the wage gap;
■Sexual orientation and gender identity : the Company continued promoting an inclusive work 
environment, combating all forms of discrimination and prejudice;
■Ethnicity : TIM continued working on the priority objective linked to issues of ethnic inclusion, considering 
the impact of the problem on Brazilian society and ensuring that the specific target was set within our ESG 
Plan of reaching 40% of black employees by 2023;
■Generation : Valuing generational diversity by bringing people of all ages together in a context of mutual 
exchange and learning;
■People with disabilities (PwD):  over 2021 an increasing number of initiatives were developed to hire people 
with disabilities and retain them at the Company and ensure their growth, breaking down cultural and 
physical barriers to guarantee them equal opportunities. Due to these actions, TIM Brasil was able to 
increase the number of people with disabilities hired. Consequently, the Company has increased its rate of 
compliance with the hiring quotas established by the Conduct Adjustment Agreement ( Termo de 
Ajustamento da Conduta, TAC , in Portuguese), signed with the Brazilian State Prosecutor (Law no. 8213/91).
Moreover, during 2021 other initiatives were developed along with the Community of TIM’s Affinity Groups: 
education campaigns and customized communications campaigns were set up, in line with the annual 
Diversity & Inclusion calendar.
Since June 2021 an ambitious project has been developed to support the employability of women: the 
intercompany program Mulheres Positivas (Positive Women). TIM Brasil guided the creation and development 
of a movement of around 50 companies that offer Brazilian women training content and job opportunities. The 
important points of the project include the offer of more than 100 courses and 700 jobs to be filled (considering 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 125all the participating companies) in the Mulheres Positivas digital platform, available on the main digital 
marketplaces.
The D&I Talks ("TIM Convida") format continued to promote numerous digital events, open to all of society 
with a goal of discussing current, important issues regarding D&I, involving important speakers and guests. In 
2021 the events recorded over 382,000 views on the YouTube platform of TIM Brasil (+155% YoY)
With regard to policy and rules, it is important to note that in July 2021 TIM included in its Diversity & Inclusion 
Policy a clause that establishes the premises of D&I in the company’s Board of Directors.
In 2021 TIM also signed several of the most important ecosystem-wide movements for each of our D&I pillars: 
WEP from Women UN; Coalizão Empresarial pela Equidade Racial e de Gênero  (Business Coalition for Racial 
and Gender Equality), which focuses on ethnic inclusion; Fórum de Empresas e Direitos LGBTI+ (Forum of 
Business and LGBTQIA+ Rights), which focuses on the LGBTI+ community and Rede Empresarial de Inclusão 
Social (Business Inclusion Network), focused on PwD.
TIM S.A. also created a new internal referral program called “ Chama pro TIMe ” (Call to Team), focused on 
minority groups, in order to promote internal diversity.
In September 2021, TIM S.A. sponsored and took part for the second year in the national event dedicated to the 
inclusion of black students in the labor market: “ Afro Presença ” (Afro Presence). The event was promoted by 
the Ministry of Labor and the UN Global Compact. Linked to the “ Afro Presença ” event, we launched, again in 
September, the new cycle of the TIM Internship Program, with a strong focus on the enhancement of diversity 
and inclusion of people belonging to minorities, with a particular emphasis on the commitment to select 50% 
women in technological areas and 50% black students in all areas.

based on the year in which they took leave. Therefore, if x took leave in 2018 and returned in 2019, his return is in any case reported in the 2018 
column. This is why the data for the 2020 column is still partial and not yet able to be published.
Moreover, the year of continued work of the employee has not been calculated according to the year in which they were actually at work after 12 
months of leave, but on the basis of the year in which they took leave. Therefore, if x took leave in 2017 and after 12 months was still at work in 
2019, his continuation at work is in any case reported in the 2018 column. As we do not yet know which of the employees who went on leave in 
2020 will still be at work after 12 months, we are currently unable to calculate the related figure.

Customer Satisfaction 
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44]  The 2021 materiality analysis confirmed the 
Group’s relationship with its customers as a material topic.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] Telecommunications are increasingly taking on a central role 
for individuals, companies and the public administration in the digitalization and growth of Italy’s economy and 
development. There is competition on innovative services and products, service quality and new technologies. 
5G, the cloud, IoT (Internet of Things), Artificial Intelligence and big data are enablers of solutions to develop 
families of services such as: smart cities, smart homes and domotics, e-health, entertainment, cybersecurity1 
and Industry 4.02. In the world of industry, for example, IoT sensors are used to collect data on the industrial 
process, which is transported to the cloud using 5G and processed by artificial intelligence to optimize 
production. Moreover, these technologies limit the environmental impact by raising the level of sustainability of 
production processes and lifestyles.  
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation, favoring the development of numerous 
applications of it, such as smart working, telemedicine, e-commerce, e-learning and services for safety, 
entertainment and leisure time. 
In this context, guaranteeing the best customer experience is increasingly a central driver for competing and 
conquering market leadership: an excellent customer experience increases loyalty and the perceived value of 
the brand and attracts new customers.
TIM adopted a model of oversight and improvement of quality and the customer experience, using a “quality 
by design” approach, with structured dedicated to defining and developing the customer journey3, to establish 
improvement plans and provide our customers with value. Transparency, simplicity and respect for the 
customer are crucial in order to offer an excellent customer experience.
TIM is also committed to the engagement with various initiatives including “make the difference”, a project 
dedicated to customer care staff, who are rewarded on the basis of the best service offered. To drive this 
transformation TIM has developed an extensive listening system, which picks up on customer experience in the 
different “moments of truth” and the different touch points of the customer journey, for example: purchasing 
a service, calling customer care, reporting a malfunction.
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43]  Of the surveys conducted, the monitoring of the Customer 
Satisfaction Index (CSI), based on the ACSI standard (American Customer Satisfaction Index), is particularly 
significant. The aim is to collect information on the quality perceived by TIM customers and customers of the 
main competitors in the various customer journeys and touch points. Monitoring the CSI has earned 
certification of conformity with the UNI 11098:2003 standard and has been included in the managerial 
(management by objectives) and collective incentive system. 
Indicator 2021 2020 2019
CSI Consumer Customers 74.26 73.81 71.78
The target set for the consumer customer CSI for 2021 was 74.24.
TIM’s ever-greater focus on “continuous improvement” of processes and the customer experience can also be 
seen through the Net Promoter Score (NPS) of customers who spoke with operators of the telephone 
assistance service, which have been confirmed to be extremely positive (NPS above 10)4.
TIM confirms its position as a leading strategic company for Italy with a key role in innovation and represents 
support for the Italian economy and for businesses.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44]  In Brazil, in 2021 TIM S.A. confirmed the 
investments in the development of the digital environment, to improve both the quality of services offered to 
its customers and customer experience in general. The My TIM App evolution process has continued, focused 
on improving performance and enriching the service portfolio, in order to spread awareness of the app to new 
customers and to launch a new in-app communication channel involving existing users. Development of new 
in-app payment methods which made TIM the operator with the most digital payment methods. 
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] TIM S.A.  also talks to its customers via Twitter, Facebook and 
Instagram, through “@TIMBrasil” ( twitter.com/TIMBrasil ), which in December 2021 reached more than 744,000 
followers, Facebook ( facebook.com/timbrasil ) with almost 2.8 million likes and the Instagram page 
(www.instagram.com/timbrasil ) with more than 62,000 comments in 2021.
In 2021, the Meu TIM app obtained the best score of all service applications of Brazilian operators. 
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] TIM S.A.  carries out two types of nationwide customer 
satisfaction surveys, by means of interviews:
■the "reactive" survey relating to both own consumer customers and competitors’ consumer customers – 
conducted every month since June 2017 (online panel5), with data consolidation every quarter – which 
measures the general satisfaction of customers with the Company and its contact points (e.g. sales

IT assets.
2 Industry 4.0 is the industrial automation that integrates new manufacturing technologies to improve working conditions and increase productivity.
3 The customer journey is the set of experiences that a customer has when interacting with a company for a specific need, from the first contact 
with the company, through a specific channel, until, going through one or more touch points provided by the company itself or by other 
consumers, the expected result is achieved or not.
4 The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is an indicator based on international standards and used in various industrial sectors. The NPS is based on the 
potential recommendation of the operator in relation to the experience accrued. On a scale of 0 to 10, “promoters” are customers expressing 
votes of 9 or 10 “detractors” are those providing a score of 0 to 6, whereas the rest of the customers are considered as “passive” and are not 
countered towards calculating the NPS. The NPS is calculated as the difference between the percentage of the "promoters" and "detractors".

to Internet connections, websites, tariff plans and offers, top ups and billing), Net Promoter Scores;
■The Transactional Survey Call Center is now the main channel for call center surveys as it covers all 
customer contact activities (front end).  This is a transactional survey because TIM’s mobile customers 
(who use the prepaid, post-paid, “control6” and corporate services) rate the call center immediately after 
“contact”, via IVR (Interactive Voice Response).

TIM continues with its strategy strongly oriented towards digitization and innovation, also offering new digital 
caring channels to the customers’ advantage, who receive personalized and quick answers that improve 
customer experience, loyalty and engagement.
As at December 31, 2021, the social caring function of TIM has handled approximately 381,500 caring 
conversations on the public page and in private Facebook and Twitter messages. The main reasons for contact 
with digital customers were requests for clarifications of a commercial, administrative or technical assistance 
nature.
TIM has maintained its role both on social networks and its digital leadership in the Socialbakers rankings; 
indeed, TIM ranks among the top telecommunications companies in Italy in terms of social media channel 
response time and rate (AMIQ7 indicator, a parameter calculated by taking into account the relationship 
between the number of public messages handled and the company’s response time within 24 hours). 
The fundamental contribution of TIM’s social networks in brand communication has been confirmed, year over 
year. 
During 2021, TIM continued promoting the social, cultural and innovative initiatives, such as those involving 
Operazione Risorgimento Digitale project, the various social issues (in particular those overseen by Fondazione 
TIM), subjects linked to inclusion and diversity and the support for communication in corporate social 
responsibility projects. 
In 2021 TIM strengthened its position as the main protagonist and player in soccer in Italy. Specifically, for the 
next three seasons, TIM will be the Title Sponsor8 of the Series A Championship, the esport tournament eSerie 
A TIM, the Primavera competitions and Women’s Soccer. Moreover, following the agreement with Dazn, as 
technological partner for distribution of Series A matches via streaming for the next three seasons, TIM 
launched its own commercial strategy with a dedicated offer. 
The growth of TIM’s social communities, created in the various channels (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, 
YouTube, LinkedIn and TikTok) was consolidated, regarding its main brands: TIM Official, TIM Business, 
TIMVISION, TIMMUSIC, with four million likers and followers.
The customer support channel on the MyTIM app and the website TIM.IT also plays and important role in 
digital caring: fixed and mobile consumer customers have the opportunity to interact with customer service in 
a smart way, via chat or by choosing to be called back by customer service, a functionality made available in 
October 2021. In all of 2021, the digital customer care team managed around 4,000,000 conversations, 78% of 
which through instant messaging (bot9) and 22% with an operator.
Moreover, the new WhatsApp customer assistance channel (TIM was the first telephony operator in Italy to 
offer this service) expanded its target of customers managed in 2021: initially reserved to TIM Pay customers10 
and customers with subsidized service (blind and deaf customers11), it now provides caring support to all 
customers with fixed and mobile lines and prospects12, contributing to expanding the possibility to contact TIM 
(especially in this period of emergency due to COVID-19).
Volumes managed via WhatsApp (human and bot) in all of 2021: 880k.
Also during 2021, TIM guaranteed continuous assistance on digital channels through the availability of 
operators, while protecting their health thanks to both the activation of protocols and all the prevention 
measures contained in the rules and regulations of healthcare and government authorities, at both national 
and local level. In this context, a central role was played by the launch of remote working activities, the 
distribution of updates and information notices on conduct prepared according to instructions sent by the 
authorities.
During the pandemic, in agreement with senior management, operators created posts13 through which they 
conveyed their support and the COVID initiatives implemented by the Company, in addition to the campaign 
#iorestoacasa (lit: I stay at home).
[GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44]  Involvement of call center operators
In 2021, the activities involving TIM call center operators progressed along the path consolidated in previous 
years, focused on gradually improving knowledge of offers, processes and systems with the distribution of 
information/certified training through the TUO portal (acronym for Trova, Usa and Organizza – Find, Use and 
Organize).
The most relevant actions focused on: 
■the recovery and cataloging of all communications sent - via service email addresses - by the departments 
overseeing the operating areas in the flows of news on the TUO portal;
■the consolidated structure of the knowledge base14, the activation of weekly gamification (info snack) for 
operators, with the aim of making information refreshers more effective – using dynamic learning – and 
potentially critical elements in customer management more evident;

■the organization of ad hoc courses for interested employees using virtual classrooms;
■the dissemination of the most significant developments using newsletters and scheduling of educational 
spaces;
■the publication of summary pages and dynamic flow charts on the most important topics; 
■the construction of ad hoc repositories with operating manuals and data sheets and communication 
templates;
■the increase of information sent by email to customers, in support of contact with them.
The continuation of the COVID-19 emergency, with the consequent widespread application of smart working 
increased in the target population the adoption of company communication and unified collaboration tools, 
like TEAMS, with persistent work chats, video calls, content sharing and integration of applications even when 
sharing information/training.
Self-service area
In 2021 TIM continued investing in the development of digital channels for remote support to its customers, an 
issue that took on central priority in the emergency phase due to COVID-19, specifically on:
■the MyTIM app, ranking among the best apps of European telecoms companies in terms of enjoyment, 
followed by the launch - the first in Italy - of the self-caring services and, in 2021, additional upgrades to 
make it more simple, functional and intuitive. MyTIM is also available on the smart speakers Google 
Assistant and Alexa;
■new MyTIM private area on the website TIM.it. Completely overhauled in terms of function and user 
experience, this allows customers to remotely manage their own line, check usage, top up and pay bills 
and manage services simply and quickly. In 2021 the MyTIM area was further enriched with new functions, 
such as the option to send a report, attaching documents;
■Artificial Intelligence (AI) Angie. TIM has also invested in the development of A.I., which makes it possible 
for customers to manage and request clarification on the services and offers for their lines using machine 
learning algorithms, the knowledge base and the services of the online channels, without going through an 
operator;
■the new website TIM.it, launched in June 2020, was subject to continuous updates and improved usability 
in 2021, to ensure that customers can obtain information by themselves without having to sign in.
In line with this approach is also the We TIM Community, available online and via the app, which is a free 
advanced crowd caring tool for customers, who, through discussion with other customers and expert users, 
can receive clarification and resolve issues by accessing a continuously updated knowledge base.
Over the entire emergency period, TIM developed an adoption and awareness plan to promote the use of 
MyTIM remote digital services, in order to reduce the impact of traveling to stores and to guarantee customer 
safety.
COVID-19 emergency – Care actions
Following the COVID-19 emergency, in order to reduce travel and protect customer health, TIM promptly 
implemented a series of care initiatives to simplify the ways of requesting a number of services via telephone 
and the use of email, instead of sending paper-based information. With the objective of simplifying the 
customer experience, a new function was developed in the customer area of the TIM.it website, which, for 
certain mobile services, allows customers to send a request to TIM with the required documentation attached 
directly. The payment of fixed bills on the website was also made easier with the new “Paga fatture di 
altri” (Pay someone else’s bill) function and by extending the payment date of the bill. 
Those functions, created to facilitate customers during the pandemic, were definitively confirmed, with the 
goal of simplifying “digital” interactions of customers with TIM and continuing the economically sustainable 
choice of reducing the use of “papery-based” channels.
PEDIUS - Managing calls for the hearing impaired
Also in 2021, in addition to the new WhatsApp channel, customers who are deaf could use the PEDIUS service, 
which allows access to TIM’s call centers, in addition to the usual channels. Launched in 2014, the service:
■is available to all customers on app stores (both Apple and Android); 
■aims to ensure that inbound contact is accessible to hearing-impaired customers through an app that 
allows normal calls to be made using voice synthesis and recognition technology. 
In 2021 TIM had 19 records15 of use of the service.

Also due to the growing focus gathered by the issue, TIM S.p.A. deactivated the service with content reserved 
for adults on September 30, 2020 for mobile lines and October 31, 2020 for fixed lines2.
TIM-Protect is the TIM option for the protection of mobile consumer customers against threats on the web, 
which can be installed on smartphones or PCs, featuring the following functions: 
■parental control: protects young people while surfing the Net, filters web searches, gives warnings in the 
case of behavior that is judged to be dangerous, allows you to block access to sites or apps or limit their 
use (maximum usage time setting);
■theft protection: protects the device from loss and/or theft, ensuring remote control by sending a simple 
instruction (block device, find device, delete data, SIM change notification); 
■protection and privacy: protects all access to e-commerce, home banking3 and social media websites. 
Ensures privacy by filtering unwanted calls and messages;
■antivirus: manages the device securely without affecting its operation, protecting it from viruses, malware4 
and other threats (during use).
The service is included free of charge in the offers dedicated to younger users (TIM Junior): there were around 
120,000 lines (source: DWO) and total revenues of around 520,000 euros at the end of December 2021.
For the complete protection of “mobile” customers and their devices, in addition to the TIM Protect service, the 
Company also offers customers a service called TIM Safe Web Plus, which does not require installation of a 
specific application by the customer and filters non-secure addresses using the DNS (Domain Name System): 
the aim of this is to keep the customer’s user experience as simple as possible.
The service includes the following functions:
■safe browsing: if an attempt is made to browse websites considered to be dangerous, an alert page 
appears. The customer can choose whether to ignore the alert and continue browsing or to stop browsing 
that specific web page;
■parental control: possibility to filter by domain category and/or by day/time, define white- and blacklists, 
pause or deactivate internet.
On the whole, at the end of December 2021, the service was activated on around 897,000 lines (source: DWO), 
with revenues of 6,642 million euros.
For fixed-line consumer customers, Safe Web Plus protects the online browsing of all devices connected to the 
home line against the main web threats. The service is essentially the same as the mobile line and also has a 
light version without parental control (Safe Web). At the end of 2021, the total number of lines on which the 
two services were activated came to around 105,000.
Total fixed-line consumer revenues from Safe Web and Safe Web Plus, for all of 2021, came to around 1.83 
million euros.
The fixed line Safe Web service for business customers offers5 a first line of defense for Internet use, capable of 
effectively countering the main threats on the web. With anti-phishing and functions to limit malware, access 
is prohibited to fake sites that aim to glean confidential personal information, financial details or private codes, 
and malicious sites designed to infect mobile and computer devices with harmful softwares. Safe Web Plus 
operates at DNS (Domain Name System) level, mediating the request to access the website before the 
connection is even established, to verify whether the address is classed as dangerous. If the destination is 
considered harmful, the browser is redirected to a protection page which informs the user of the site’s danger, 
making it inaccessible for security reasons.
Monthly revenues for 2021 amounted to over 1 million euros. Lines with TIM Safe Web (TSW) activated came 
to around 700,000, of which around 250,000 accounts with TSW on mobile lines and 450,000 accounts with 
TSW on fixed lines: packages (97%) and profiles (3%).

[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 416] [GRI 417] [GRI 419] The 2021 materiality analysis confirmed 
customer relations quality as a material topic which, for the TIM Group, also incorporates responsibility for 
the products and services offered1.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 416] [GRI 417] [GRI 419] TIM is primarily an operator of 
telecommunications services, which do not endanger the physical health of users2, and it does not produce 
the telecommunications equipment it sells.  
In order to verify that the products placed on the market comply with health and safety legislation, the 
Company has:
■specific internal structures that plan “type tests” for the initial assessment of products in relation to 
company specifications and incoming quality checks for products that have reached the marketing 
stage (fixed and cordless telephones3, access gateways4, VDSL5, FTTH6 and FWA7, STB8 etc.), taken 
both from Italy and from foreign production facilities of suppliers;
■laboratories that test the products marketed by the Group, particularly as regards electrical safety and 
the electromagnetic emissions of the mobile devices9.
In this way, any non-conformities of products are detected during initial testing or prior to their market 
release, ensuring that products that do not conform with the essential requirements of the European 
Directives do not reach the end customer. 
Services provided to customers are subject to the requirements set out in the Service Charters and in the 
Terms & Conditions of Subscription, available at telecomitalia.com.
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 416] [GRI 417] [GRI 419]  This paragraph describes the 
management approach assessments for each of the above mentioned Standards, with the relative 
methods used and results.
[GRI 416-1] In its laboratories, TIM validates the satisfaction of the essential requirements envisaged by the 
current Directives for the release of CE marking; conformity with these requirements is certified at source 
by the manufacturer. For products sold in Italy, the reference framework is the set of standards that 
support RED10 Directive 2014/53/EU, EMC11 Directive2014/30/EU, and Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU, 
divided by product macro-family12.
In relation to electrical safety in the use of equipment by customers, as required by the Low Voltage 
Directive, TIM carries out checks on the technical provisions introduced to reduce the risk of electrocution, 
overheating, fire and mechanical hazards, by applying harmonized standard EN 62368-1.
Furthermore, TIM checks: 
■energy efficiency aspects, required by Directive 2009/125/EC ErP (Energy-related Products), as 
equipment placed on the market, are checked against the stand-by/off-mode power consumption and 
performance limits set by European Regulations 1275/2008/EC, 801/2013/EC and 2019/1782/EC, for 
equipment and their external power supplies (available as accessories);
■device functionality under various environmental conditions of terminal installation and use including 
potential accessory components for connection to the fixed network is checked. Checks are carried out 
in compliance with temperature and humidity ranges established by ETSI (European 
Telecommunications Standards Institute) standards for the specific “service condition”, on which 
different “severity” levels are based. The checks are carried out based on the provisions of the ETSI EN 
300019 standards, with the tests set out under IEC-EN series 60068-2-1 (cold), 2 (dry heat), 14 
(temperature changes), 30 (moisture changes), 78 (continuous humidity);
■electromagnetic compatibility, regulated by Directives 2014/30/EU and RED 2014/53/EU, since 
unintentional electromagnetic signal emissions are checked – to avoid interference that can harm 
radio communication – and to fulfil certain electromagnetic interference immunity requirements. In 
TIM, constant checks are carried out on terminals and network equipment to determine whether they 
comply with the requirements of international ETSI, CENELEC13 standards regarding electromagnetic 
compatibility. In particular, checks are carried out on the compliance of equipment with the limits set 
by standards to limit the emission of electromagnetic disturbances which, in addition to polluting the 
surrounding environment, can interfere with radio communications.

13  European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization.To promote sustainable development in its areas of influence - in addition to the mandatory requirements 
for electrical safety law, energy consumption and EMC on marketed equipment, TIM also carries out checks 
on electrical (in compliance with the series K ITU-T Recommendations14) and mechanical robustness (in 
compliance with the installation classes required by the European standard ETSI EN 300019) requirements, 
so as to reduce waste disposal of electrical and electronic waste (WEEE) from the very beginning. Ensuring 
equipment placed on the market of has an adequate level of electrical and mechanical robustness, in line 
with the expected stress in the field, reduces the rate of equipment failure and, therefore, the quantity of 
waste to be sent to the appropriate disposal facilities. The addition of these robustness requirements, also 
within TIM device specifications, requires the manufacturer to use adequate protection devices on the 
electrical interfaces of devices, such as overvoltage and surge suppressor, with the consequent reduction in 
the number of destructive failures; with such technical expedients, it follows that equipment functionality 
is extended over time and, in the event of occasional damage, can be easily recovered by replacing a few 
components in repair centers.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 416] [GRI 417]  By law, telecommunications equipment sold in 
Brazil  must be approved by the regulatory authority (ANATEL), which, in its laboratories, verifies 
conformity with Brazilian legislation on electrical and electromagnetic safety. There is specific legislation to 
be complied with for each kind of equipment; TIM S.A. asks its suppliers to ensure that devices have the 
ANATEL certificate of approval. No cases of non-conformity (ANATEL) or administrative proceedings were 
recorded in the area of SENACON and CADE (both with liability also shared by the Regulator) in 2021.
[GRI 416-2]  Over the past three years, no non-conformities with customer health and safety legislation 
have been found in any product that has reached the final marketing stage for:
■European regulations in Italy;
■regulations and voluntary codes in Brazil. 
The percentage of significant product and service categories for which the impacts on health and safety 
are assessed, with a view to improvement, amounts to 100%.
[GRI 417-1]  Also in 2021, TIM required that all its suppliers of fixed telephony products provide:
■an environmental declaration;
■a statement about the origin of the tantalum if it has been used in the components (REACH);
■the user manual;
■a document containing safety information; and
■details of any hazardous materials and disposal information.
In addition to the above documents, starting in 2022, TIM requires that all new suppliers of fixed telephony 
fill in an additional document called the “ Sustainability Checklist ”, in which the supplier must include all the 
information regarding sustainability, production and end of life of the product, listing the various types of 
materials and their disposal, including packaging materials.
In 2021, for technical assistance under warranty, TIM used only refurbished modems. It is also assessing 
the possibility of selling these refurbished products to the public.
With regard to mobile devices, as they are consumer products that TIM merely resells and do not require 
any customization, the Company simply requires that suppliers comply with national legislation.
The sale of refurbished smartphones, launched in fall 2019, continued in 2020 and 2021, with the inclusion 
of new refurbished models (iPhones) on TIM’s product list, exclusively Class A+ to ensure top quality (only 
manufacturer’s spare parts) for the end customers.
To reduce the environmental impact, following the example of the new models, accessories and packaging 
materials are also reduced in the packaging of refurbished smartphones, and chargers and headsets are 
no longer included in the packaging.
In the area of new smartphones, TIM’s price list continues to include the loyalty program “TIM Next,” which 
offers customers the option to replace their smartphones with a new model. This way, TIM incentivizes the 
collection and recycling of used smartphones, inserting them in a correct cycle of refurbishment.
For several years now, TIM has organized recycling of obsolete smartphones, which is carried out through 
disposal featuring online auctions. The products are grouped into lots and the companies identified and 
authorized for that purpose can participate in the auctions.
The products sold are subsequently taken apart in order to recover all the components of interest, for their 
“second life cycle”.
Moreover, to reduce the environmental impact of using plastic, TIM sells SIM cards in the half card format 
(half the size of normal SIM cards) and uses the recycled plastic for card carriers15. This makes it possible to 
save around 14 tons of plastic per year.

15 Card carriers i.e. for SIM cards.[GRI 417-1]  In Brazil , in addition to compliance with the national legislation, TIM does not have procedures 
for product and service information and labeling. 
[GRI 417-2]  Over the past three years, no non-conformities regarding product information and labeling 
have been found in any product that has reached the final marketing stage (100% tested for fixed and 
mobile terminals). 
Considering the state of emergency caused by the spread of COVID-19, in accordance with the company 
policies intended to protect both the health of the auditors and full compliance with government 
instructions, TIM opted for and strengthened the self-certification process of the batches prepared for 
delivery; the individual suppliers were made responsible for directly carrying out the essential checks to 
document the quality/conformity of the batches/products being delivered.
The table below shows the results of incoming quality checks conducted on “fixed and mobile terminals” 
by the specific company department of TIM.

There were no cases of non-compliance with the service information and “labeling” regulations in Brazil  in 
2020 and 2021. TIM S.A. only received financial penalties in 2019, when four incidents occurred for which 
ANATEL imposed penalties for a total of 247,132 reais.
The regulatory Authority’s sanctioning procedures for non-conformities with regulations regarding 
information on services are part of the system of “penalties for the violation of regulatory legislation 
regarding consumer protection in the supply and use of TLC products and services;” this means that, for 
Italy, non-conformities regarding information on services have been merged with non-conformities 
regarding the supply and use of services (table below).

[GRI 417-3] In Brazil  the only notifications relating to advertising and marketing communications are issued 
by CONAR25, a non-governmental self-regulation organization for advertising which assesses non-
conformities with the Brazilian Advertising Code of Conduct (“CBAP”) and can recommend that the 
company change/correct or suspend the advertising (it does not impose financial penalties); CONAR seeks 
to ensure that each advertisement is true, honest, and compliant with the laws of the country and the 
principle of fair competition. The infringement procedure may be closed if the parties reach a settlement, if 
the perpetrators cease the infringement or if the violation of the Code of Ethics has not been 
demonstrated.
In 2021 TIM S.A. received the following three notices of service:
■CLARO filed a brief against TIM, in relation to several of its offers. CONAR’s decision is pending;
■CLARO initiated a lawsuit against TIM regarding several advertisements broadcast. TIM S.A. has sent a 
reply to CONAR and is awaiting its decision;
■OI filed a complaint against TIM, in relation to its offers. TIM S.A. agreed to change several points in the 
advertising campaign the complaint referred to.
In 2020, TIM S.A. received a warning notice for delaying the implementation of CONAR’s recommended 
changes regarding infringement proceedings brought by CLARO in 2019.
TIM S.A. received three other infringement proceedings, one from CONAR and two from CLARO. TIM S.A. 
filed objections in all proceedings, and a preliminary decision by CONAR ordered TIM S.A. to comply with 
the recommended changes. However, the advertisement in question was published in September 2020 
and removed prior to CONAR’s preliminary decision.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 14321 In 2021 no significant non-conformities with laws or regulations for the supply and use of products and services were found (as set out by 
ANATEL). With regard to the failure to comply with the Consumer Code, TIM paid a penalty of R$ 1,333,982.77 (considering penalties over R$ 
500,000 as significant).
22 On June 19, 2020, the company’s Board of Directors approved the execution of a Term of Adjustment of Conduct (TAC, Conduct Adjustment 
Agreement) between the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (ANATEL) and TSA, after passing the final ANATEL resolution in the 
eighth extraordinary meeting of the Board of Directors. The agreement covers penalties totaling approximately 639 million reais, which will 
be closed due to commitments tied to improving quality and customer experience, developing the digital presence channels, reducing 
complaint rates and increasing network infrastructure in more than 2,000 locations.
23  If only significant fines are considered, i.e. those in excess of 500,000 reais, TIM S.A. did not receive any such fines in 2019. TIM paid two fines 
in 2019; the first of 11,484,107 reais (ordered by a consumer rights protection agency) for non-compliance with customer service standards 
(call center). The other was for 244,551 reais, imposed by another agency following various complaints from customers for various reasons 
(contracts, billing, etc.).
24 The cases are governed by the Istituto dell’Autodisciplina Pubblicitaria (Advertising Self-Regulation Institute), which operates in compliance 
with the Commercial Communications Code and is responsible for settling all disputes relating to advertising involving associated entities, 
directly or indirectly. The Jury’s decisions never result in pecuniary sanctions but, where appropriate, will result in an order to withdraw the 
contested advertisement. 
The two non-conformities in 2021 regarded:
• The Wind Tre S.p.A. proceedings against Telecom Italia S.p.A. (hearing of July 27, 2021). The telecommunications operators Windtre and 
Vodafone filed a motion with the Jury of the IAP (Istituto per Autodisciplina pubblicitaria) against TIM’s advertisement which promoted 
TIM’s Series A Wi-Fi, with Lino Banfi as spokesperson. The Jury’s decision rejected all of the counterparty’s requests except for the phrase 
“Wi-Fi pronto per la serie A” (Wi-Fi ready for Series A) and expressions with similar meaning;
• The Windtre, Vodafone, Fastweb and Sky proceedings against Telecom Italia S.p.A. (hearing of September 28, 2021). The operators 
named filed a motion with the Jury against TIM’s advertising which mainly promoted the Series A matches and featured the following 
claims: “Se le partite vuoi vedere, TIMVISION devi avere” [If you want to see the match, you need TIMVISION] and “Mister, c’è un solo 
modo di vedere il calcio” [Coach, there’s only one way to watch soccer], with Lino Banfi and Roberto Mancini as spokespeople. The Jury 
accepted almost all of the counterparties’ motions, except for the expressions “la nuova casa del calcio e delle tue passioni” [the new 
home of soccer and your passions] and refused the publication of the decision in the media. 
The 2020 non-compliance related to the “Passa a Kena Mobile” [Switch to Kena Mobile] telecommunication shown on Mediaset television 
networks in June; TIM ceased the advertisement in question on the date of notification of the injunction.
25  Conselho Nacional de Autoregulamentação Publicitária  (National Advertising Self-Regulatory Council).Safeguarding privacy and personal data protection 
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 418] The 2021 materiality analysis confirmed, as a material topic for 
the Group, the protection of privacy, the protection and security of personal data.
The Group believes that the confidentiality of customer information is a primary commitment for 
telecommunications companies and monitors its systems 24 hours a day in order to prevent and detect any 
unauthorized access attempts.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 418]  Respecting privacy regulations is a priority for TIM, which since 
2003 has had a structured organizational model in place which is capable of overseeing the correct application 
of this legislation at Group level1. Company departments are committed to ensuring the correct processing of 
personal data of data subjects, including customers and employees, in carrying out business activities. 
In 2018, the Data Protection Officer function was established at Group level, dealing with control, consultation, 
training and information regarding the application of privacy legislation, in compliance with the specific 
provisions of Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of 
personal data (so-called "General Data Protection Regulation," or GDPR), applicable in Italy and in the other 
countries of the European Union from May 25, 2018. 
The GDPR is the primary source of the applicable regulatory framework on data protection in Italy and the 
Personal Data Protection Code (Legislative Decree 196/2003, as extensively amended by Legislative Decree 
101/2018) now contains the national provisions completing those of the GDPR.  
The adoption of legal measures and the instructions of the Privacy Guarantor for personal data protection is 
assured by constantly updating the Group regulations and policies. Of these, the “System of rules for the 
application of the regulations relating to the protection of personal data in the TIM Group” (System of Rules) is 
particularly important; it defines the provisions and operating instructions to comply with these provisions.
Already in the course of 2018, the System of Rules was thoroughly revised in the light of the application of the 
GDPR; in 2019, 2020 and 2021, the System of Rules was further updated with reference to regulatory 
developments, in particular in relation to Legislative Decree 101/2018, which adapted the Personal Data 
Protection Code to the GDPR, and to the additional provisions of the law and the Italian Data Protection 
Authority’s Decisions that followed during the last three years. In 2021, the update of the System of rules 
regarded, amongst others, the matter of the transfer of personal data to subjects (e.g. contractual 
counterparties of TIM Group) established abroad, in light of EU Decision 2021/914 of the European Commission 
of June 4, 2021, setting out the new “model contractual clauses” in accordance with the GDPR, which 
constitute one of the tools to be used for the transfer of personal data to third countries outside the EU, which 
do not offer sufficient personal data protection. 
Continuing on from the activities carried out in 2020, the Privacy Department intervened in connection with the 
processing of the data of employees and other categories of data subjects under the scope of the COVID-19 
epidemiological emergency; in particular, it:
■provided support to corporate departments in helping assure the correct interpretation and application in 
TIM and in the Group companies of the provisions of Decree-Law no. 127 of September 21, 2021, which 
regulates the use of COVID-19 certificates (“green passes”) and which extended - also to employers in the 
private sector - the obligation to check the green passes of employees, suppliers, visitors or subjects 
authorized to access the Group’s sites to work;
■drafted a specific disclosure on personal data processing for the purpose of the green pass for those 
accessing the sites of TIM and Group companies that have adopted TIM’s Regulation and to support the 
other Group companies, which have drafted their own regulation for the preparation of the disclosure;
■supplemented the contracts with the supervisory institutes in respect of checking green passes, with the 
consequent update of instructions envisaged with the appointment of the Data Processor of such 
institutes.
In addition, over the course of 2021, TIM ensured implementation of its improvement actions identified in 2020, 
regarding the telemarketing processes, implementing improvement actions, from the technical/information 
and procedural point of view, and in terms of internal checks, intended to further improve its sales activities in 
accordance with the regulatory framework in matters of personal data protection and in accordance with 
provisions of the Italian Data Protection Authority.
In this scenario, we find the training activities held by TIM’s Privacy Department, which, during the first half of 
2021 focused on personnel of customer care service providers dedicated to consumer and business customers. 
The training, carried out by means of video conference calls due to the restrictions imposed by COVID-19, 
regarded the general requirements envisaged by the GDPR and, above all, the rules and instructions defined by 
TIM in compliance with current regulations governing commercial contacts, the processing of customer/
prospect requests2 relative to the exercise of privacy rights and the detection and management of data 
breaches. Ten training sessions were held, involving around 165 people.
During the second half of 2021, a TIM personnel training course was also delivered, dealing with HR 
Management and regarding the following topics: analysis of essential principles and privacy rules and, above 
all, the review of rights granted by personal data protection legislation and the rules for the correct processing 
of requests to exercise privacy rights made by employees or former employees of TIM. Four training sessions 
were held by video conference call, attended by 105 employees.
The personal data, pursuant to EU Regulation no. 2016/679 (so-called GDPR) as any data referring to a natural 
person identified or identifiable, must be processed lawfully and correctly, stored carefully and updated and 
must not be excessive or stored for longer than necessary. Therefore, the IT systems must be configured in 
such a way as to minimize the use of personal data.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1441 With the aim, amongst others, of avoiding, mitigating, remedying any negative impacts or improving positive impacts.
2 A prospect is a person that is part of the target of possible customers of a company; in substance, a "candidate" who could possibly or probably 
become a customer.The “data subject” (any natural person to which the personal data refers) must receive preliminary information 
about the purposes and methods of processing data.
Personal data processing must take place in the presence of a suitable legal base, namely in particular the 
preventive consent of the data subject, the execution of a contract or precontractual measures with the data 
subject, the fulfillment of legal obligations, the pursuit of the legitimate interest of the Data Controller (for 
example as regards processing implemented to prevent late payments and fraud). 
In particular, data subject consent is required for direct marketing purposes (e.g. the sending of advertising 
materials, direct sales, promotional calls) and individual profiling (which allows for the identification, using 
electronic processing, of the conduct and habits of data subjects so as - amongst other aspects - to improve 
the services supplied, satisfy the specific needs and direct commercial proposals of interest). In addition, the 
Data Protection Authority also regulates customer profiling in the electronic communications sector, 
envisaging specific measures.  
The data subject has the right to access their personal data, to obtain information about the purpose and 
method of processing and to exercise the additional rights envisaged by the legislation, including the right to 
revoke consent or request cancellation of their data where storage is not required by the law.
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 418-1] The Company has issued specific procedures to guarantee 
compliance with legislation and which enable the collection, use and storage of the personal data of its 
customers; the updated versions of these procedures are available from the Group intranet. 
The effective application of the internal policies is monitored through an extensive control system based on the 
regular self-assessment procedures, sample checks carried out by the relevant central and regional 
departments, based on established procedures and methods, as well as for planned and identified second level 
controls, also due to the inherent risk level of processing.
In particular, following the review of telemarketing processes, during 2020, the internal checks carried out on 
such processes were optimized and extended in line with the provisions of the Italian Data Protection 
Authority.
Finally, also during the course of 2021, TIM continued to take the steps required to ensure the implementation, 
into the internal processes, of the provisions on data breaches as well as to respond to the numerous requests 
made by customers (for example, aimed at knowing the personal data processed by TIM or to exercise other 
rights) and the Italian Data Protection Authority (requests for information to TIM).

Corrective and sanction provision in regard to TIM S.p.A. - (Provision 7/2020) of January 15, 2020.
The Provision, issued by the Data Protection Authority essentially regards activities linked to telemarketing in 
respect of consumer customers; additional topics considered regard the management of certain apps, the TIM 
Party program, the data breaches and the storage of OLO (Other Licensed Operator) customer data. The total 
amount of the sanction, equal to the initial sanction given that TIM has not appealed against it, was 27.8 
million euros. TIM has paid 13.9 million euros, having closed the dispute in accordance with current legislation 
in force in Italy, by paying, within the deadline of 30 days, an amount equal to half the sanction applied. 
In compliance with the provision of the Authority, TIM has implemented the Provision, particularly as regards 
improving telemarketing processes and the internal control system, in compliance with the due dates set by 
the Italian Data Protection Authority.

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 418]  As pursuant to article 5 of the Federal Constitution, and article 3 
of the General Law on Telecommunications No. 9,472 of 1997, the right of customers to the confidentiality of 
their personal data is established (with the exception of cases provided for by the law). The Personal Mobile 
Service regulation, in articles 89, 90 and 91 of Resolution No. 477 of the national telecommunications agency 
(ANATEL), requires companies to take responsibility in this respect and establishes that any waiver of 
confidentiality must take place only if requested by the relevant authority in the cases provided for by law. The 
Federal Law (Marco Civil) No. 12,965 of April 2014 (Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet4), under 
Articles 10 and 11, ensures the privacy and protection of personal data for internet users.
On August 14, 2018, the President of the Republic approved the General Data Protection Act No. 13,709/2018 
(LGPD in Portuguese), the most important Brazilian law on privacy. Due to the scenario caused by the 
COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, the law was subject to draft legislation and temporary measures, with 
consequent postponement of the application of fines and sanctions to August 1, 2021, whereas other articles 
came into force in August 2020. The LGPD contains various regulations and obligations related to privacy and 
personal data protection, both online and offline, and is applicable practically to any organization. 
The Law governs data protection and is applied to any processing regarding a natural person or by a legal 
entity (automated or otherwise) or a legal entity governed by public or private companies, regardless of the 
context, country of its head office or country in which the data are held, provided that:
■the processing is carried out in the national territory; 
■the purpose of data processing is the provision of goods or services or the processing of data of persons 
located in the national territory; 
■the personal data subject to processing has been collected in the national territory.
At any time, the data subject has the right to exercise – asking the data controller – their rights to privacy, 
access to their data, requesting deletion, etc..
To guarantee the confidentiality of its customers’ information, in accordance with national legislation 
(including Articles 10 and 11 of the “ Marco Civil ”), TIM S.A. has issued relevant internal policies and procedures 
to ensure the confidentiality of the related information based on “need to know” principles (in order to ensure 
that access to records and communication about customer details is only permitted to the employees who use 
this information in their work) and the separation of duties. These policies and procedures recall the methods 
for the classification and management of information in order to guarantee suitable protection levels. 
In addition, the Chief Executive Officer coordinates the Privacy Committee, in accordance with Organizational 
Design5 no. 1347/18 – which comprises the appointment of the Data Protection Officer (DPO), the model for the 
application of regulations, the adequacy of activities and the assessment of related impacts as prescribed by 
Brazilian General Law concerning data protection (LGPD in Portuguese).
In the Committee, the Compliance department keeps the implementation of the actions required to comply 
with the LGPD in full alignment with the other departments that form it, namely:
■Legal,
■Regulatory, Institutional and Press Relations,
■Business Support Officer,
■Chief Technology Information Officer,
■Chief Revenue Officer,
■Human Resources & Organization.
To keep abreast of issues regarding the matter, in 2019 TIM S.A. reviewed its customer data privacy policy and 
updated and published it in 2020. This document is transparent, contains more information and explains how 
TIM S.A. processes its customers’ data. 
TIM S.A. carries out its activities also in accordance with ISO 27001, the international standard that describes 
the best practice for information security management. In August 2020, the Cyber & ICT Security Department 
started the route to achieve this certification, which is expected to be completed by end 2022.
The Company also completed the review and update of the terms and conditions of its contract, to make it 
complaint with the LGPD, in relation to how TIM S.A. in a transparent manner, collects and processes personal 
data. After having classed the information, the Company carries out risk analyses with the help of systems that 
save the data, mitigating the vulnerabilities that might be used to access confidential information. Employees 
and service providers are also made aware of the need to adopt data security measures; all providers offering 
value added services (VAS) must sign a non-disclosure agreement with TIM S.A..
The Cyber & ICT Security Department is responsible for updating the related policies and procedures, ensures 
their maintenance and, as information security governance office, guarantees the involvement of all relevant 
departments, as well as disclosure and compliance with the guidelines within the TIM Group in Brazil. In 2021, 
the IT & Security Compliance Department issued the policies and created an internal process for managing 
incidents and data losses involving personal data.
The pandemic was one of the challenges of 2020 and 2021, during which TIM S.A. launched its Contingency 
Plan in order to allow all employees to work from home and ensure business continuity, including the call 
center and the critical technical areas. The Cyber & ICT Security department undertook many actions to 
protect information in home offices and led various campaigns to raise employee awareness. Starting the last 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1464 Civil rights structure for Internet in force in Brazil.
5 Organizational project.quarter of 2021, TIM S.A. launched a pilot project to foster the return of employees to certain offices, examined 
and prepared in compliance with protocols defined to guarantee the highest possible safety standards.
Considering the technological resources, TIM S.A. has specific tools that support the management of particular 
aspects, such as those relating to Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), identity 
management and content filtering, among others monitored by the Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC).
In 2021, TIM S.A. continued to adjust all the new contracts that it had stipulated and that require the 
processing of personal data, in addition to modifying the backlog of contracts signed before the LGPD but still 
in force, in order to include the update relating to data protection, in particular for business partners. 
In addition, in 2021, TIM delivered various training courses:
■to all its staff, with compulsory e-learning; 
■a more advanced course, directed (in particular) towards its managers and strategic employees; 
■to its suppliers free of charge, with the aim of raising their awareness of compliance with the LGPD and of 
what TIM S.A. expects from them in terms of security and privacy measures.
TIM S.A. has updated its Privacy and Cookie Policy and created various internal regulatory documents, which 
seek to govern and guide the processing of personal data by internal departments. The Privacy Centre can be 
accessed using the following link: https://www.tim.com.br/sp/sobre-a-tim/institucional/seguranca/politica-de-
privácia  .
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 418] [GRI 418-1]   TIM also launched the DPO Mailboxes to respond to 
requests from people interested in the processing of their data. The Compliance Department is already 
operational on the mailboxes and has received more than 700 requests by December 2021; no specific 
complaint has been made about the violation of privacy or loss of data of TIM S.A. customers.
In 2021, TIM S.A. received 718 lawsuits from customers, regarding accusations of fraud for the exchange of 
chips and access to sensitive data about customers. That same year, 718 lawsuits were closed (not necessarily 
opened in 2021): the judicial authority ruled in favor of TIM S.A. in 59% of cases, considering the late payment 
decisions. For cases that determined payments, the Company was sentenced to pay almost 2.1 million reais.
In 2020, TIM S.A. was the addressee of 687 cases relating to data privacy; of the 593 cases concluded (some of 
which had begun in previous years), 293 had a favorable outcome for the Company and 300 unfavorable, for 
which it paid sanctions of around two million reais.
The difference between the legislations of Italy and Brazil does not allow for any comparisons to be drawn 
between homogeneous data.

TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1502 Remote learning.Conciliation procedures  
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] The 2021 materiality analysis confirmed the 
Group’s relationship with its customers as a material topic. 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] The extrajudicial conciliation procedure between 
TIM and the consumer protection associations who signed the framework agreement (in the 1990s) was the 
first example of joint conciliation in Italy. In 2011 the European Parliament recognized the “Italian joint 
conciliation” as an example of best practice based on a memorandum signed by the company and consumer 
protection associations, under which the company undertakes to activate an alternative procedure to settle 
any disputes arising between the company and the consumer, known as the “Alternative Disputes 
Resolution” (ADR). In December 2019, twentytwo consumer protection associations signed up to the 
conciliation agreement, nineteen of which registered with the CNCU (National Council of Consumers and 
Users), an organisation representing consumer associations - chaired by the Italian Ministry of Economic 
Development - which has the task of contributing to improving and strengthening consumer satisfaction levels. 
In 2016, on entry into force of Legislative Decree No.130/2015 - implementing European Directive No. 2013/11/
EU - the Italian legislator made an important choice by counting “joint conciliations” in ADR procedures, 
completely reforming the original Art. 141 of the Consumer Code. By virtue of this new European and national 
regulatory framework, the TIM-Consumer Protection Association Joint Conciliation Procedure was:
■recognized as an “ADR Body” possessing the requisites of stability, efficiency and impartiality required by 
the regulatory framework;
■registered on the list of recognized ADR Bodies, established by the AGCom (Italian Communications 
Authority) on June 30, 2017. 
The basis for the dissemination and success of the conciliation procedure is:
■it is a free model;
■speed of the process;
■the mandatory requirement to seek recourse to conciliation as a prerequisite for judicial requests to 
proceed.
Undoubtedly, conciliation is successful also thanks to the good relationships built up and maintained over the 
years with consumer protection associations which, as stakeholders of the Company, have always provided a 
wealth of useful information on critical consumer issues to the company through their contributions. 
Following the establishment of the ADR Body, there was a revision of the Joint Conciliation Regulation and the 
application methods of the unitary conciliation protocol established between TIM and the Consumer Protection 
Associations registered at the CNCU. The protocol is considered unitary because it serves as a common basis 
for other telecom operators (Vodafone, WindTre, Fastweb). It includes procedures and guidelines to be applied 
in order to guarantee a comprehensive harmonization for end consumers. The ADR Body, established in 
compliance with the provisions of Art. 141 ter of the Consumer Code, is established at the TIM headquarters. 
Since 2009, in compliance with the voluntary undertakings given and approved by the AGCom in 2008, TIM has 
also been managing conciliation requests at Co.Re.Com (Regional Communication Committees) and Chamber 
of Commerce offices (until June 2018), replicating the organizational model successfully applied for joint 
conciliation. In this way, customers can choose to use the consumer protection associations or take advantage 
of alternative paths through Co.Re.Com to settle any disputes with the Company out of court.
With Resolution 203/18/CONS "Approval of the regulation on dispute resolution procedures between users and 
operators of electronic communications", from July 2018 AGCom has introduced the new conciliation 
management system "ConciliaWeb", developed by the Authority along with the procedures for the on-line 
presentation and management of the conciliation event for customers.
Beyond the choice of procedure by the customer, the underlying aspect of the conciliation is always the 
customer’s needs, making it possible to build up a good relationship between the customer and the Company.
In line with the commitments made in the previous year, in February 2020 TIM signed a memorandum of 
understanding with six of the biggest consumer protection associations (Adiconsum, Federconsumatori, 
Codacons, Udicon, Cittadinanzattiva and Adoc). The aim of the memorandum is to create a relationship of 
greater synergy and more transparent dialog intended to mitigate the level of disputes in relations with 
consumer protection associations. In addition, and again with the aim of best consolidating the agreement 
between the Associations and TIM, the introduction of a new channel for handling consumers’ complaints 
addressed to TIM and submitted to the Consumer Protection Associations has been guaranteed.
After signing the Memorandum of Understanding in February 2020, TIM signed an additional agreement with 
the consumer protection associations to speed up the distribution of digital skills among citizens/consumers, 
optimizing the push towards digital provided by a project, “Operazione Risorgimento Digitale”(“Operation 
Digital Rinascmento”), launched at the end of 2019 and reinforced by the emergency caused by the pandemic.
With this additional collaboration, TIM has made another step forward which will contribute to the reduction of 
the current digital divide and to the implementation of a strategy that also considers the consumer protective 
point of view of the consumer protection associations. 
As such, the collaboration that began in July 2020 ended at the end of 2021; the initiative involved seven 
associations (Adiconsum, ADOC, Cittadinanza Attiva, Codacons, Federconsumatori, Udicon and Altroconsumo) 
and relates to the creation of webinars, together with TIM, on the drive for digital tools and protection for a 
safer use of technology in the segments considered most fragile. The activity has clearly been well received 
and will result in the creation of educational pills focusing on a more agile use of digital tools so that less 
experienced segments can use the new technology.
In 2021, agreements with consumer protection associations were further consolidated, implementing an open, 
communicative model. These were specifically implemented through numerous meetings held by the most 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 151active consumer protection associations with TIM and our Chief Executive Officer on the issues of the "soccer 
offer" and the upgrade to fiber, in line with the Decree-Law of May 31, 2021 of the National Recovery and 
Resilience Plan (NRRP), which sees TIM on the front lines as part of a model providing a great boost to the 
digitization of Italy. In this area, in June 2021, TIM conducted the webinar “5G innovazione, opportunità e 
regole” (5G: Innovation, Opportunities and Rules), organized along with the Consumer Forum. This online 
event, focused on the most consumer-based aspects, involved speakers from the institutional world - the 
President of the Italian Data Protection Authority (P. Stanzione), the Commissioner of AGCom (Italian 
Competition Authority - L. Aria), the Mayor of Genoa (M. Bucci) and the Director of the Mobility, Environment 
and Territorial Agency of the Municipality of Milan (V. Sevino) - and the research world (the President of the 
Bordoni Foundation, A. Sassano, and Prof. F. Bassan).
On the issue of training, in 2021 TIM provided a fully online course for TIM conciliators and all conciliators of the 
consumer protection associations. The course, organized with the assistance of the Consumer’s Forum, was 
concluded at the end of September 2021, training both newly hired conciliators and providing professional 
development to conciliators already working through a less detailed didactic session. The program of training 
activities featured new rules driving the digitization required by the pandemic. Significant drive was provided by 
the ADR Bodies to validate the lists of personnel trained and the qualification of new conciliators following the 
two-year training course. The next course will be provided in 2023.
In 2021 it is worth noting that the joint conciliation activities were moved to a new platform, MIRART AC, which 
replaced the previous structure named Conarb. The new platform, which is part of a wider program to simplify 
the interfaces used to track disputes, involved 20 consumer protection associations in the training program 
dedicated to using the new interface, conducted by the regulatory function, along with MIRART engineering. 
The new platform resolved the numerous problems linked to the management and processing of both joint 
conciliation and complaints on the channel dedicated to the associations that are parties to the Memorandum 
of Understanding with TIM.
TIM supported the conciliation activity through:
■the seminars and joint training initiatives involving dedicated personnel from TIM, AGCom, Co.Re.Com. and 
Consumer Protection Associations; 
■the debates, conferences, interviews and the other promotional activities involving senior management in 
order to disseminate the correct cultural approach to the subject. 
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] To date, the conciliation model has achieved 
significant results in terms of quality and numbers. Substantially in line with the previous year, in 2021 the use 
of the out-of-court channel of the Co.Re.Com (Regional Communication Committees) and joint conciliation 
with consumer protection associations continued to be highly appreciated, with 64,067 cases received (8,804 
regarding joint conciliation and 55,263 conciliation through the Co.Re.Com).
In 2021, the following were settled:
■96.9% of the requests for joint conciliation discussed (9,928 settled out of 10,242 discussed), a percentage 
essentially stable compared to 2020 (97.3%, i.e. 11,525 settled out of 11,850 discussed);
■88.7% of the conciliation requests discussed at the Co.Re.Com (43,070 settled out of 48,535 discussed), a 
percentage in line with 2020 (89.3%, i.e. 48,545 settled out of 54,391 discussed).
Conciliation is becoming increasingly widespread among customers, particularly in view of the:
■better knowledge of the procedure (both joint and conciliaweb) which is considered to be a quick and 
economical way of resolving disputes;
■economic crisis that leads to conciliation even for marginal amounts;
■the widespread territorial presence of Co.Re.Com and the various Consumer Protection Associations, able 
to bring the conciliation tool increasingly closer to the local needs of consumers.
It is worth noting the significant boost to testing linked to processing complaints with the consumer protection 
associations, which simplified the process, as well as speeding it up, to the benefit of end-users.
If expanded and strengthened, in 2022 this activity will enable TIM to decrease the requests for conciliation, 
recovering significant resources.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44]  In Brazil , according to the official figures from 
SINDEC1, TIM S.A.  is the economic group with the lowest number of complaints in the PROCONS (which is part 
of SINDEC), holding fifth place on the ranking of complaints for the second year in a row: around 48,000 in all 
of 2021.
Since it began, the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the partnership actions with PROCONS2, whose offices 
remained closed, and consumers’ requests were satisfied promptly and remotely. With the population 
gradually being vaccinated, in the second half of 2021, most of the Procons gradually returned to providing in-
person assistance, guaranteeing the provision of the actions under the partnership, specifically the task forces 
on debt payment. In 2021, TIM S.A.  participated in twenty of these events.
On August 24, 2020, TIM S.A.  implemented its own ombudsman, a second-level service channel aimed at 
providing assistance to customers who used the TIM service channels and did not receive a response within the 
set time or whose requests were not resolved.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1521 National consumer protection information system.
2 Consumer protection program.The purpose of the ombudsman is to transform a regulatory obligation into an opportunity, bringing 
customers’ voices into all of the channels for complaints of TIM S.A., in order to continuously improve company 
performance, reducing the number of requests and increasing customer satisfaction. 
For all of 2021, the ombudsman of TIM S.A. replied to over 338,000 requests.
The Users Council now in office was established in March 2020 for the three-year period 2020–2022, with 60 
new members of the Regional Councils taking office. 
Due to the impacts of COVID-19, in 2021, the work and ordinary meetings were held remotely, also 
guaranteeing the achievement of the objectives of the Users Council. 
In September 2020, ANATEL approved the new Regulations for the telecommunications Sector Users Councils. 
The Regulations were drawn up with the contribution of TIM S.A. and other operators through a public 
consultation conducted by ANATEL in November 2019. The main changes, which will enter into force in 
January 2023, are:
■the reduction of the number of members from sixty to eighteen;
■the change to the composition, from regionally-based councils in the country to a national council. 
In August, 2021 the VII Forum of the National Users Council was held. Just as the 2020 session, it was held 
online, due to the social distancing measures for COVID-19, allowing all the members of the Users Council to 
participate. During the Forum sessions, various issues were discussed, including those regarding consumers’ 
rights, 5G technology, the ombudsman, telemarketing, service quality, consumption habits and the 
management of the Users Councils.
TIM fully fulfilled its obligation to hold four rounds of ordinary meetings of the 2021 Users Council.
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] The improvement in complaints also continued 
in 2021, with a decrease of over 40% on 2019 (in 2020 the decrease came to -17%). TIM also obtained excellent 
results in settling the claims presented by the PROCONS offices. Below is the data for the whole of 2021 
(source: official SINDEC report): number of claims processed: 48,895 (in 2020: 68,430); CIP (Letters of 
preliminary inquiries) 85%.
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] SENACON3 has maintained the 
Consumidor.Gov.br platform since 2014. It makes it easier to resolve customer complaints and simplifies the 
work done by PROCONS; TIM S.A. was one of the first companies to sign up to this platform, through which 
customers can state if the complaint has been resolved or not and review the quality of the response given by 
the company. In 2021 (as in 2020), the average satisfaction score of TIM S.A.’s customers, who used the 
aforementioned platform service, was 3.9 on a scale of 1 to 5.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] In August 2020, TIM implemented its own 
Ombudsman, a second-level service channel aimed at providing assistance to customers who used the TIM 
service channels and did not receive a response within the set time or whose requests were not resolved. Until 
August, TIM only had one internal channel, which was not available to the public, to meet the requests of 
friends and families of company employees.
The purpose of the ombudsman is to transform the legislative obligation into an opportunity, to bring the 
customer’s voice within the Company, in order to continuously improve performance by reducing customer 
requests and increasing customer satisfaction. 
The Ombudsman also has:
■an Ombudsman, specially designated for the business, which is connected to the Presidency;
– an operating manual containing all rules of participation, available on the TIM website.
Further information is available on the following TIM website: www.tim.com.br/sp/para-voce/atendimento/
ouvidoria  
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] In 2014, following an ANATEL resolution, TIM 
established its own Users Council, the aim of which was to propose solutions that improved the quality of the 
services provided. In 2017, the Users Council, alongside the Department of Public Defense, created a new 
conciliation channel –  Canal 0800 Defensoria Pública  – aimed at reducing complaints taken to court, through 
direct communication between the Public Defenders and TIM.
Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the subject of accessibility, in 2021 TIM continued to 
disseminate the Consumer Protection Code in Libras (Brazilian Sign Language) through the Users Council page 
on TIM’s website, online meetings of the Users Council and Consumer Protection Bodies, and participation in 
the VI National Forum of ANATEL Users Councils. During the online meetings of the Users Council and the VI 
National Forum of ANATEL, the Giulia application (which provides accessibility for the deaf) was also 
recognized as a social tool by Consumer Protection Bodies and other public bodies tied to the sector.
In 2020, the Board of Directors of the Regulatory Authority approved the new Regulations for the 
Telecommunications Sector Users Councils. The Regulations were drawn up with the contribution of TIM and 
other operators through a public consultation conducted by ANATEL. The main changes (effective from 
January 2023) include reducing the number of members from sixty to eighteen, and the change from Council 
by geographical region of the country to National Council.

TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1564 The full list of quality indicators, and their respective objectives for 2020, is available on the www.tim.it  and www.timbusiness.it  websites. The 
above objectives are established by AGCom, with resolution no. 154/12/CONS for “mobile” services and resolutions No. 131/06/CSP, 244/08/CSP, 
400/10/CONS and 151/12/CONS for fixed internet access services. Suppliers
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 204] [GRI 414] The 2021 materiality analysis confirmed, as a 
material topic for the Group, the evaluation and consolidation of social and environmental aspects of the 
supply chain. 
Digital represents the new collective progress factor which, in different ways, offers new opportunities that 
greatly impact the economy and society. 
Suppliers have a direct influence on the communities and areas within which they carry out their activities, to 
which must be added the involvement of organizations that oversee the environmental and social aspects 
related to these activities.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 204] [GRI 414] The procurement process adopted by the TIM 
Group is based on the competitive comparison of the technical and economic characteristics of the offers 
presented by the selected suppliers, based on corporate procedures that comply with business ethics.
Products and services are acquired at the best market conditions and must meet particular requirements of 
functionality, quality, safety and respect for the environment, in complete compliance with current laws and 
legislation.
[GRI 102-9]  The purchasing departments focus on specific sectors, so as to provide accurate responses to the 
requirements of internal customers and stakeholders.
TIM’s purchases mainly take place in the two geographical areas where the Group’s major activities take place, 
Italy and Brazil, and are mainly aimed at the following categories of products and services:
■telecommunications networks,
■telecommunications products,
■information technology,
■technical and professional services,
■power systems,
■other.
 [GRI 102-9] In total, in 2021 suppliers that received purchase orders from the Domestic BU1 came to 3,294 
(-4.4% compared to 2020 and -10.1% compared to 2019) and those from the Brazil BU came to 750 (-8% 
compared to 2020 and -14% if compared to 2019)2.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414] The selection of the TIM Group’s suppliers involves a 
pre-contractual qualification stage, in which the economic/financial and technical/organizational 
characteristics are assessed. If the result of this assessment - which also includes consideration of the business 
ethics and respect for Human Rights, workers’ rights and the environment - is positive, the suppliers are 
registered on the Group Supplier Database.
[GRI 412-3]  In all the contracts signed, there is a specific clause which makes it mandatory for the supplier to 
accept the principles expressed in the Group's Code of Ethics and Conduct3.  
[GRI 412-3]  As regards domestic operations, the Italian suppliers in the database with considerable order value 
(the threshold is 3,000 euros cumulative per year), totaling 2,462 suppliers, equal to around 75% of suppliers in 
2021, receive initial screening4 in relation to compliance with the principles of the Code of Ethics and Conduct 
and are subject to regular assessment. The actions taken by TIM to check suppliers varies depending on the 
riskiness of the supplier and the value of the purchase: ranging from simple to complex questionnaires and 
document checks to specific audits on sustainability matters.
[GRI 204-1]  With reference to the Domestic BU scope5, in 2021, total orders were placed with 2,728 suppliers, of 
which 2,444 have production units on Italian territory and account for 91% of total orders. In particular, of the 
2,444 suppliers, 73% are Italian companies and the remaining 27% are companies belonging to multinationals 
that carried out the activity through Italian companies. The number of local Brazilian suppliers is 728, equal to 
97% of all suppliers of the Brazil BU and account for 98% of total orders.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1571 The scope of suppliers of the Domestic BU also includes Telecontact, Olivetti S.p.A., TI Sparkle S.p.A. TI Trust Technol. S.r.L., HR Services Srl, TI 
Ventures S.r.l., Flash Fiber Srl, Fibercop S.p.A., TIM Servizi Digitali SpA, INWIT S.p.A., Noovle SpA, TI Sparkle Germany Gmbh, TI Sparkle Netherlands 
BV and TI Sparkle Turkey, and the remainder of Persidera (the latter sold in 2019).
2 Some suppliers received purchase orders from both the Domestic BU and the Brazil BU.
3 The Group Code of Ethics and Conduct (CE) reads: “Compliance with the Code must also be guaranteed by external collaborators and, where 
envisaged in the company procedural system, by third parties that do business with the Group.” In particular, the internal procedures require 
suppliers to accept the principles laid down by the CE, and contracts for temporary consortia or corporate investments to contain clauses for 
safeguarding the Organizational Model 231 (which is based on the CE). The UN Global Compact is, on the matter of Human Rights, the point of 
reference of the Group’s CE, which reads: “TIM has signed up to the United Nations’ Global Compact on Human Rights, work standards, 
environmental protection and the fight against corruption, and ensures that this institutional commitment is fully implemented by undertaking 
regular initiatives on environmental and social issues.” The CE also contains specific clauses on the prohibition of discrimination, intimidation, 
corruption and the protection of health and safety. Moreover, the Group policy on respect for Human Rights specifies that “Fundamental Human 
Rights (e.g. working hours, fair remuneration, minimum age for starting work, workplace conditions, accessibility to the disabled, protection of 
maternity, prohibition of harassment, prohibition of forced/compulsory/restricted labor)” and “rights regarding health and safety (we consider the 
high standards of health and safety as a milestone of our success and our aim is to minimize injuries and occupational illnesses)” must be 
guaranteed for both the people of the Group and the human resources of suppliers.
4 Excluding government agencies.
5 Intra/group, energy and delegated acquisitions are excluded[GRI 414-1] Specifically, in 2021, 100% of new suppliers enrolled in the Register signed a specific questionnaire 
in which they commit themselves, and any authorized sub-contractors, collaborators and employees, to 
observe the principles of behavior contained in the Group’s Code of Ethics and Conduct6.
While the supply is taking place, registered companies which have received purchase orders in markets that 
are strategic for the Group normally undergo incoming quality control checks (a requirement for the 
acceptance and use of the purchased goods) and monitoring of the vendor rating7. Environmental and social 
audits are also carried out on some of these8.
For some sectors, the TIM Group also measures and monitors subcontracting suppliers, in particular, for 
network jobs; there were 989 subcontracting businesses (+18% compared with 2020 and +11% compared with 
2019). In this sector, therefore, the estimated total number of suppliers involved in the supply chain was 1,0269.
In the last three years, no significant changes have occurred in the structure of the Group’s supply chain.
In the  Brazil BU , products are sourced from local suppliers as far as possible. TIM S.A. checks that its suppliers 
comply with labor laws, including by reviewing a list of suppliers who have not complied with the relevant laws, 
which is available on the website managed by the “ Business Pact for Integrity and Against Corruption and the 
Brazilian National Pact to Eradicate Slave Labor10”. One potential supplier, included on the above list as a result 
of violating child labor, forced labor or other types of laws, cannot sell their services and products to TIM S.A. In 
2021 and 2020, no risks regarding child labor or forced labor arose for any suppliers that answered the social 
and environmental questionnaire of TIM S.A.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1586 In Brazil, the percentage was 99%.
7 Supplier performance measurement and monitoring system.
8 [GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414] In particular, checks are envisaged on health and safety and on the environment, the result 
of which goes towards forming the supplier rating, to which the system of penalties/incentives is connected. Checks are also envisaged in relation 
to respect for employment legislation.
9 In the Brazilian BU, at present, there is no systematic monitoring of level two suppliers.
10 Business Pact for Integrity and Against Corruption and the Brazilian National Pact to Eradicate Slave Labor.Sustainability initiatives
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414]  In 2021, the process that defines the activities aimed at 
improving the sustainability of the supply chain continued to be applied. These activities involve the 
qualification, incoming quality and vendor rating stages.
In particular, the suppliers were classified according to the potential risks associated with their sustainability 
performance, carried out using a specific method that considers the social-environmental and business 
continuity aspects associated with the procurement markets in which they operate. For this reason, the 
procurement markets (i.e. procurement categories homogeneous among themselves) have been classified in 
accordance with parameters such as:
■the geographical areas of reference and the risks connected with them,
■the potential impact on the environment and on the society of the suppliers’ activities and of the products 
and services supplied throughout their entire life cycle, including risks relating to violations of Human 
Rights, employment and environmental,
■the impact on the reputation of TIM as a customer.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414] A matrix has been created which, by relating the 
spending associated with the specific purchase market to the risk index calculated on the basis of the 
parameters listed, has allowed purchase markets to be divided into four classes, identifying those that are 
critical from the point of view of sustainability and economic impact. Suppliers belonging to the classes at 
greatest risk are the subject of sustainability audits carried out by third party companies specializing in the 
sector. These audits are repeated periodically to monitor the implementation of any corrective actions and, if 
the results are positive, to verify that the standard of performance found is being maintained over time. The 
tools developed and used for the Domestic BU have been explained and transferred to the Brazil BU.
[GRI 308-1] [GRI 407-1] [GRI 408-1] [GRI 409-1] [GRI 414-2]  Also in 2021, all the suppliers of the Domestic BU 
were assessed in order to consider their social/environmental risk; the number of suppliers to be considered at 
higher risk did not change on 2020: it was confirmed at 59 (+40% compared to 2019 and +40% from 2018). 24 
purchase and suppliers operating in the following geographical areas are considered to be at greatest social 
risk: Asia, Central and South America, North Africa and Eastern Europe.
[GRI 403-8] TIM is completing the upgrading of its supply chain support platforms. This significant innovation 
will support and enable, among other aspects, sustainability management within the supply chain as an 
integral and structural part of the entire process. 
[GRI 410-1]  The TIM Group does not use its own personnel for security services, and therefore, 0 personnel 
received training on specific topics. For all employees of organizations which supply security guard services in 
Italy, the Consolidated Law on Public Security must be complied with, in particular Art. 138, subsection 2, which 
governs the professional and training requirements of security guards. In Brazil, Law 7102/83 lays down rules 
on private guards. Amongst others, it establishes that all those intending to be hired as guards for a guard 
business must have attended an advance training course, held by schools accredited by the Federal Police. 
After security guards are hired, they must attend a refresher course every two years, which includes, among 
other topics, problems relating to human rights.
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414]  Since 2014, all new suppliers interested in a 
qualification process, relating to areas of procurement that present the greatest sustainability risk, answer a 
specific self-assessment questionnaire to determine the socio-environmental sustainability risk.
The questionnaire was developed based on the main requirements contained in the relevant standards for 
responsible corporate management relating to compliance with ethical values and safeguarding the 
environment (UN Global Compact, SA 8000, and ISO 14001), as well as best industry practices.
[GRI 308-1] [GRI 414-1]  The sustainability self-assessment questionnaire is integrated into the application that 
handles the supplier qualification process, submitting it by default to all new suppliers operating in markets 
deemed to have a sustainability risk. Processing the answers provided determines a supplier sustainability risk 
index, which is used to be able to enter the supplier in the vendor list.
That questionnaire was updated in 2020 to include new questions on issues of greater social sensitivity, such 
as anti-corruption, data protection, conflict minerals and environmental issues, e.g. greenhouse gases and 
energy efficiency, ant to define a new metric which, adjusted the weighting system of the questions to give 
greater emphasis to the most sensitive issues.
A mechanism for renewing the questionnaire was also introduced to maintain an up-to-date overview of the 
supplier base.
[GRI 308-1]  In 2020, a new Sustainable Procurement Policy was drafted, which replaced the previous Green 
Procurement Policy and sets out guidelines for establishing the social and environmental requirements for the 
products/services purchased.
The aim of the policy is to integrate social, economic and environmental impacts into the decision-making 
factors considered by staff and partners during the procurement process. To this end, the policy has been 
integrated and incorporated into the broader Product and Service Procurement  Policy, which governs the entire 
procurement process.
The document has been published on TIM’s Vendors Hub supplier portal and in the sustainability section of the 
gruppotim.it website, to encourage the engagement of all stakeholders.
Specific projects have also been launched which aim at organically incorporating the sustainability assessment 
of products/services to be purchased into both the phase of establishing the purchase requirement and the 
tendering phase. These activities will be fully implemented in 2022.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, various communications were sent to all suppliers, inviting them to 
strictly observe all precautions to prevent the risk of contagion and spread of the disease, providing guidance 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 159as to the behaviors to adopt in relations with TIM and customers, so as to minimize the risk of contagion. 
Moreover, all suppliers have been provided with the regulations drawn up by TIM for its staff (technical as well 
as sales and post-sales) regarding safe access/interventions and the use of PPE (personal protective 
equipment).
[GRI 414-1] [GRI 414-2]  In 2021, in Brazil , TIM S.A. sent out a self-assessment questionnaire on sustainability 
issues  to suppliers with significant risk, involving 83% of the total number of suppliers. All 1,037 suppliers 
involved replied to the questionnaire (by late 2021) and the results will be used to guide future selection 
processes.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 160Sustainability checks
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] Activities intended to verify the sustainability performance level of 
common suppliers and sub-suppliers continued in 2021 in the framework of the Joint Audit Cooperation1 (JAC) 
initiative, in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding signed at the end of 2009 by TIM, Orange 
and Deutsche Telekom. Proximus, KPN, Swisscom and Vodafone Group subsequently joined the initiative in 
2011; Telenor and Telia Company in 2012; Verizon in 2013; AT&T, Telefónica and Rogers (which exited in 2020) 
in 2016; Mobile Tele System, Telstra and Veon (which exited in 2020) in 2018; Elisa OYJ in 2019 and TDC, MTN 
and British Telecom in 2021. 
Currently, JAC has 18 members in 16 different countries, and represents more than 50% of sector revenues and 
more than 2.7 billion connections. 
In December 2021, the on-site audits by JAC regarded 40 countries and more than 1.4 million workers. 71% of 
the audits performed were conducted at factories of Level 2, 3 and 4 sub-suppliers.
The necessary operations were launched in 2021, and at the end of the year the economic details were 
defined, to transform the initiative, currently operating based on MoU (Memoranda of Understanding), into a 
Non-Profit Association (NPA) with headquarters in Brussels.
The purposes of the Joint Audit Cooperation are:
■to verify the sustainability of the most important suppliers/sub-suppliers that are common to the members 
of the JAC, with production plants located in geographical areas with a significant degree of socio-
environmental risk. The audits are carried out by Third parties using a specific method developed by the 
JAC members themselves, who share the results of the verifications;
■to contribute to the increased sustainability of suppliers/sub-suppliers involved, by devising and 
implementing corrective actions and ongoing improvement programs, establishing long-lasting 
cooperation with them, mutually beneficial in terms of efficiency, productivity and risk reduction in the 
supply chain;
■to perform capacity building activities, through specific supplier training programs, also in order to 
disseminate a culture of sustainability throughout the supply chain (sub-suppliers and sub-sub-suppliers);
■share tools to address common and globally relevant issues, such as climate change or circular economy.
[GRI 308-2] [GRI 407-1] [GRI 408-1] [GRI 409-1] [GRI 414-2] Between 2010 and 2021, thanks to the gradual 
increase in the number of members of JAC, and despite the pandemic of the last 2 years, 812 audits2 – 71 in 
2021 alone – were carried out in the production plants (of suppliers and sub-suppliers) located in Asia, Central 
and South America, North Africa and Europe. The audits were carried out through international specialized 
companies selected by competitive tender, and related to a total of around 1,477,900 workers (over 107,000 in 
2021 alone). The suppliers included in the audit campaigns belonged to the user devices and appliances, 
network appliances and IT equipment production sectors. 
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 204] [GRI 414]  The table below shows the non-conformities 
recorded during audits on Group suppliers, including those relating to Human Rights.

From the start of the socio-environmental audits (2010) to 2021, Joint Audit Cooperation conducted a total of 
812 on-site operations. This total includes: JAC and VAP (Virtual Audit Process) audits, workers’ surveys and 
JAC Audits by the JAC Academy.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1611 Further information is available on the jac-initiative.com website.
2 Including 391 on TIM suppliers. The total number of audits may be affected by the presence of some audits conducted over two years. 
3 This item includes, inter alia, conflict minerals, ISO 27000 standards, privacy, responsible advertising, anti-competitive practices, intellectual 
property, corrupt practices.[GRI 308-2] [GRI 414-2]  For all the non-conformities encountered that have negative social and environmental 
impacts, as shown in the table, specific corrective action plans were drawn up that established, inter alia, 
resolution procedures and timetables. The implementation of these plans is monitored on a constant basis by 
the JAC members4. 
In 2021, as reported in the table above, 402 corrective action plans (CAP) were developed, 190 of which already 
completed, while the others are being revised. As shown in the chart below, this did not change the trend in 
resolutions by the JAC Foundation (in the three-year period 2018-2020 alone, 89% of the non-conformities 
detected were corrected within one year from the start of the corrective action plan, for a total of over 650 
corrective actions).
It was confirmed that the top three areas affected by these actions were health and safety, working hours and 
environment.
In 2021, also due to the continuing pandemic, the annual forum with suppliers involved in the JAC program 
was held via a virtual conference.
Over 450 participants ‘attended’ this conference, held for the tenth anniversary of the JAC Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) Forum. Telecommunications operators explored new regulatory trends, requirements and 
best practices that shaped sustainable supply chain management in 2021 and beyond. This collaboration in the 
information and communications technology (ICT) sector aims to create growth and impact aligned with 
increasing legislative and consumer demands for sustainable business practices. This ‘meeting’ of sector 
operators and their commercial partners strengthened the sectors commitment to rebuilding business for the 
future and promoting sustainability over their supply chains.
Lastly, awards were given to suppliers that adopted best practices in health and safety and that stood out for 
the spirit of collaboration shown during the CSR audit campaign. 
Supplier involvement initiatives
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414] Use of the suppliers’ portal (vendors hub), launched at 
the end of 2011 to improve communication and optimize operational processes, by applying social networking 
systems to the business context, is now well established; on 01/10/2022 the Portal has around 4,521 vendors 
enabled to use the application platform. The portal allows suppliers to access a private area to view important 
data and events connected to their relationship with TIM and manage all their own details, thus acquiring 
significant advantages in smooth operation and transparency. The vendors hub also includes a public area 
containing information for potential suppliers.
Documentation is exchanged electronically (e.g. offers, purchase orders, contracts, qualification 
documentation, surveys), reducing the environmental impact resulting from the use of paper, transporting and 
storing documents.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1624 GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414]  The aim of the initiative is to help suppliers in countries which are at greater risk in terms of 
sustainability principles to improve their performance; non-conformities always result in corrective actions and not in the termination of the 
purchase agreement.Supply chain commitments
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414]
 These objectives are part of the larger process of integrating sustainability into TIM’s entire supply chain.

suppliers operate. The same applies in general to the total number of suppliers belonging to the various procurement markets.
2 The KPI refers to new suppliers and existing suppliers in case of renewal or extension of their qualification.
3 At the beginning of 2019 the supplier assessments based on a questionnaire containing social and environmental principles were replaced by a due 
diligence questionnaire relating to ethical principles and the conflict of interests. In any event, the previous socio-environmental survey was 
applied to all suppliers of goods and services (not just to those with amounts exceeding 1 million Brazilian reais). 83% of suppliers completed the 
socio-environmental survey in 2021, 64% in 2020 and 87% in 2019.Institutions
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 413] The materiality analysis emphasized the increasing importance 
attributed to ESG1 indicators by institutions and society in general. From this perspective, the Group is 
determined to maintain collaborative and transparent relations with supranational, national and local 
institutions in order to facilitate dialog on matters of mutual interest and to ensure TIM’s position is faithfully 
represented in the two countries in which the Group operates: Italy and Brazil.
Our target audiences in this respect are:
■central national institutions (Parliament, Government, Ministries, Public Administration, etc.);
■local institutions and their representative associations;
■sector and non-sector authorities, such as AGCom, AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority), the Italian 
Data Protection Authority, the Italian Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and Environment;
■European and international institutions, such as the European Commission, the European Council and 
Parliament, BEREC2, OECD3, UN4, Global Compact, ITU5 and other UN agencies or programs, other 
international platforms such as G20.
Central national institutions
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 413] Lobbying activities are principally conducted with the 
parliamentary committee members of the upper and lower houses of the Italian parliament concerned with 
issues that could impact on the company, including those of an economic and financial nature or concerning 
privacy, telecommunications, Internet and TV. Involvement in parliamentary hearings is also a way of 
examining specific issues in detail and creating opportunities for discussion about matters being debated in 
parliament. 
The monitoring of law-making activity among institutions often leads to amendments to individual measures 
being proposed. 
Furthermore, relations with national institutions comprise participation in discussions with the Italian Ministry 
of Economic Development, in coordination with the technical and regulatory oversight areas of the company 
for the relevant aspects, for the representation of the Group’s position on significant topics, such as the 
evolution of the allocation of radio-electric spectrum broadband to electronic communication services and 
digital inclusion plans.
Moreover, TIM provides information to ministries (mainly the Ministry of Economic Development) regarding the 
activities of the inspection body (parliamentary questions) directed at the Group.
In the context of activity carried out with the Ministries, TIM participated in the public consultation held during 
the year by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development regarding the draft Legislative Decree transposing 
Directive (EU) 2018/1972 which established the European Electronic Communications Code. TIM also 
participated in the public consultation launched by the MITD (Ministry for Technological Innovation and Digital 
Transition) on the “Italia a 1 Giga” plan.
National legislative activity specifically monitored by TIM during 2021 mainly concerned draft legislation being 
examined by the Italian parliament and the law decrees introduced by the government which might have an 
impact on the electronic communications sector, as well as all those connected to the COVID-19 emergency.

Local institutions
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 413] Institutional relations at local level are constantly maintained 
with the Regions, Municipalities and Provinces (or similar public bodies) throughout the country so that an 
enduring and profitable relationship is established. Relations are also maintained with the following 
associations: ANCI6, UPI7, UNCEM8, ALI9.
TIM has a central function (Local Institutional Affairs) entirely dedicated to the management of relations with 
local authorities, which has also set up permanently in the area for ease of communication and to build 
relationships with government bodies. The function also relies on local authority accounts in the region, 
specialists in managing relations with governmental institutions on technical matters concerning the 
development of fixed and mobile networks. 
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 413] Local Institutional Affairs, as part of its duties:
■carries out all possible actions of an institutional nature aimed at facilitating the development of the fixed 
and mobile telecommunications network; also carries out actions supporting the relevant company 
departments for the issue of authorizations and permits required for network development;
■identifies the intervention priorities of the other company departments through the Field Integration 
Committee10; 
■establishes the priorities and determines how to interact with public bodies in light of the requirements 
identified;

■the development of fixed and mobile ultrabroadband networks;
■digitalization of public utility services;
■the spread of digital culture.
With full respect for the principles of transparency and accountability, TIM responds flexibly to requests, 
regardless of how they are received from local institutions. 
Joint projects between TIM and local authorities are managed in a way that defines the roles and duties of 
each party, formal control mechanisms and measurement tools. TIM promotes the formation of joint control 
committees, i.e. committees formed of representatives of all the parties involved. The composition and 
objectives of the committees are determined according to the specific requirements of the project and provide 
for the presence of stakeholders without any kind of discrimination, including gender discrimination.
Monitoring and constant interaction with the decision-making centers of local institutions take place by means 
of meetings, hearings, the presentation of position documents and involvement in workshops as well as in the 
work of regional commissions and specialist working groups. Furthermore, TIM frequently organizes 
communication initiatives on specific issues of local interest.
[GRI 413-1]  Among the main subjects of dialog with local authorities during 2021 we would highlight the 
following:
■development of the new ultrabroadband networks (NGAN11), implementation of the LTE standard and 
launch of the new 5G technology;
■actions of an institutional nature involving local administrations aimed at encouraging development of the 
fixed and mobile telecommunications network;
■drawing up protocols with local authorities in order to develop new fixed and mobile generation access 
networks;
■draft regional laws and municipal regulations regarding the installation of mobile telephony systems and

European and international institutions
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 413] Relations with European and supranational institutions are 
expressed in various manners, in particular through participation in discussion platforms, public consultations, 
workshops, meetings with members of parliamentary committees of interest for the Group, meetings with the 
European Commission, Permanent Representatives of EU Member States, Agencies or working groups and 
specialized studies under the auspices of EU institutions, including the Centre for European Policy Studies, the 
European Internet Forum, etc.
The positioning towards institutions and EU bodies takes place through individual actions on topics of interest 
to the Group and/or through participation in trade associations, in particular ETNO, the European 
Telecommunications Network Operators’ Association, and GSMA, the association of mobile operators (TIM is a 
Board member of both associations).
The issues raised at European level, subject to the main legislative/regulatory acts of interest to the Group, 
include but are not limited to the Digital Services Act proposal, intended especially to prevent the distribution 
of illegal content and the Digital Markets Act proposal, intended to ensure the contestability of the digital 
markets, now dominated by the major online platforms; the Roaming regulation proposal which seeks to 
maintain the Roam Like at Home principle and to introduce a number of changes on the wholesale cap, quality 
of service, fair use, etc., the proposed revision of the guidelines on state aid for broadband and ultrabroadband; 
the revision of access recommendations; the guidelines on horizontal and vertical agreements; and the NIS2 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 16711 Next Generation Access Network.directive proposal on security. TIM has actively participated in analysis and advocacy in relation to the various 
proposals from the EU institutions, with the preparation of both individual and association positions (through 
ETNO), it met with the European institutions of reference, specifically the representatives of the EU 
Commission, the European Parliament and the Council (Italian Representation to the EU and rotating 
presidencies). TIM also follows closely discussions at European level on the revision of the ePrivacy Directive 
which is under discussion even now by the EU Council. As part of the works on the EU Green Deal and the 
green transformation, works are also continuing on the Fit for 55 package, a package of 13 legislative proposals 
intended to speed up the achievement of the climate objectives (reduction of emissions by at least 55% by 
2030 and climate neutrality by 2050). These include the Energy Efficiency Directive, which pinpoints the ICT 
sector as one of the most impacted sectors (use of 5-9% of total EU electricity with resulting production of 2% 
emissions) and the Taxonomy Regulation intended to direct cash flows towards sustainable economic 
activities. 
TIM is also particularly active in European discussions intended to guarantee a safe and legal online 
environment; in particular the Group follows discussions on proposals relating to the responsibility of 
intermediaries in the distribution of terrorist content, and discussions on the need to adopt ethical principles in 
the development of artificial intelligence.
With reference to the protection of children, TIM follows an EU initiative intended to increase children’s safety 
when they browse the Internet: the Alliance to better protect minors online, a platform launched by the EU 
Commission. Moreover, TIM follows the “GSMA – Mobile Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse Content” work 
group in the context of the GSM Association, for technological, policy and communications initiatives aimed at 
protecting children in the mobile phone sector.
TIM is active in international discussions such as the OECD by monitoring technical working groups on security 
and AI, as well as following through the BIAC working groups on various issues, access and connectivity, data 
strategy, e-privacy, digital tax, competition, going digital, trade.
For several years TIM has also followed the B20. In 2021 it actively participated in the B20 Italy summit by 
contributing to the preparation of the G20 guidelines relating to the digital transformation.
With reference to digital skills, TIM became a member of the Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition (DSJC), 
established by the European Commission to bring together all bodies and institutions active in tackling the lack 
of digital skills in Europe.
TIM actively participates in a series of initiatives, including with the EU Commission, such as the Digital 
Upskilling For All (DUFA) initiative promoted by ETNO and UNI Europa ICTS, which aims to develop and 
distribute best practice for digital retraining and gender and intergenerational inclusion of the workforce in ICT 
roles in the European sector of telcos; the Digital Volunteers Program (training activities for SMEs), the Pact for 
Skills (to encourage partnerships and initiatives intended to retrain digital skills). Moreover, a series of meetings 
are underway with the EU Commission to define new proposals to bridge the gap between basic and ICT skills.
Relations with government institutions in Brazil
[GRI 413-1] Over the years, TIM has established excellent relations with institutions, at every level: Government, 
Congress, Regulatory and Antitrust Authorities, sector associations and the press. Exchanges with the above 
parties are intense and frequent and based on objective proposals, declarations and positions intended to 
explore specific issues not only for the Company, but for the entire sector. Governmental relations activities 
occur at federal level primarily with the Ministry of Communications and with several other Ministries: Casa 
Civil (Brazil), Ministry of Economy, Justice and Public Security, Regional Development, Infrastructure, Science, 
Technology & Innovation, Education, etc.. At Congress level, TIM communicates with Deputies and Senators 
who constitute Committees that deal with (by way of example, but not limited to) economic and financial 
matters, privacy, telecommunications, infrastructure and consumer protection. At regional level, TIM is in 
frequent communication with local institutions and authorities regarding general matters relating to the 
telecommunications industry, with emphasis on the development of infrastructure and network coverage and 
other topics of interest to the local community. Proposal presentations, meetings with stakeholders on specific 
topics, stimulating debates, active participation in public hearings and contribution to public consultations, are 
the company’s main means of interaction with the above institutions. Furthermore, TIM’s presence at 
institutional level is increasingly supported by Instituto TIM activities aimed at the democratization of science, 
technology and innovation, facilitating social development in Brazil, through promoting math and science 
education for children and teenagers, and the development of free technologies to support public policies. 
Since 2013, Instituto TIM’s work has already reached all 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District, involving 
over 700,000 people.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 168Competitors
The TIM Group is committed to promoting fair competition, a factor considered to be in its interests and those 
of all market operators, customers and stakeholders in general, promoting and participating in initiatives and 
projects, together with competitors, and in the management of technical round tables and the activities of 
trade associations.
In this context our stakeholders are:
■the Other Authorized Operators (OAO) and Internet Service Providers;
■the Italian Communications Authority (AGCOM);
■the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM);
■The Ministry of Economic Development and its in-house company Infratel S.p.A. for the topics relating to 
the development of the ultrabroadband network;
■the National telecommunications agency (ANATEL) in Brazil;
■associations, federations and national and international trade associations.
Services for Other Authorized Operators
Wholesale Market (hereinafter “WM”) is the TIM Department, which, within the scope of the Chief Regulatory 
Affairs & Wholesale Market Office, operates as the point of contact for OLOs and ISPs regarding the provision 
of network infrastructure and wholesale services for its own consumption and/or subsequent marketing by the 
said operators of electronic communication services to their own end customers. Working in collaboration with 
other company departments, WM is responsible for identifying the requirements of customers-operators, 
defining the marketing mix of the product/service, pre- and after-sales design and the drawing up of offers and 
contracts, sales, support and billing for products/services supplied and external communication through the 
various channels operative on the market.
Organizational and administrative separation between the Retail departments of TIM and WM, which is 
verified every year by an external body, ensures compliance with the principles of equal treatment and non-
discrimination established by current regulatory provisions and in particular Resolution 152/02/CONS.
On an annual basis, WM draws up and submits the reference offers (RO) for the various wholesale services 
regulated by the Italian Communications Authority (AGCOM). The process of approval of each offer of 
reference envisages an investigation phase under the scope of a public consultation with all electronic 
communication service operators coordinated by AGCOM. This phase may result in a review of the Offer 
published by TIM following clarifications requested and the related provisions expressed by AGCOM, which 
approves the contents and controls the work of WM so as to guarantee the protection of market development. 
AGCOM also acts as the guarantor and relevant authority in disputes brought by OLOs/ISPs and end users on 
regulatory matters. 
In addition to the regulated services, RW.WM offers infrastructure and transmission capacity, data access and 
transmission, TLC equipment hosting, outsourcing, digital services and all the added value services that allow 
operator networks to be "virtualized". 
Each operator has a direct relationship with its own account manager in the Sales department of WM, who 
receives the customer-operator's requests and proposes standard solutions or projects through the stipulation 
of contracts in accordance with current regulatory requirements. In particular contracts relating to regulated 
services include clauses which provide for constant monitoring of the various stages of the supply of the 
service, ensuring that a number of the main indicators are subject to periodic notification to AGCOM. The 
interests of the client-operator are safeguarded on a continuous basis, formalized through a process of 
conference calls, video conferencing and meetings involving all the company departments concerned. 
Activities with the Italian Communications Authority (AGCOM) and the 
Ministry of Economic Development
TIM interacts with AGCOM and Ministry of Economic Development in order to contribute to the administration 
of the regulatory process on matters considered concrete to the growth in value of the Company. 
For this purpose, Telecom Italia pursues an honest dialog and ongoing discussion with the Authorities and 
institutions with the aim of achieving a simple, effective and symmetrical regulatory framework. Furthermore, 
the Group makes its own knowledge available by participating in public consultations, institutional hearings, 
conventions, public meetings and by presenting appropriate testimony and petitions.
The constant discussions with AGCOM, Ministry of Economic Development, and the institutions ensure that TIM 
gathers their opinions, supplying transparent, reliable responses, and anticipates events, creating and 
exploiting the best opportunities for the Company. TIM provides the answers required (e.g. public consultations, 
defensive testimony, supply of data and information of various kinds, etc.) and always ensures the 
completeness and reliability of the contribution.
In the case of violation proceedings started by AGCom, TIM presents testimony, expert reports and other 
defense documents, requesting a hearing by those responsible for the proceedings on the facts that are the 
subject of the dispute. 
In this respect, the Company also considers whether to submit a proposal, subject to the termination of the 
disputed conduct, aimed at improving competitive conditions in the sector, removing the anticompetitive 
consequences through suitable and stable measures.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 169The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM)   
As part of the protection of competition and the consumer, TIM interacts with the Competition Authority both 
in a preventive way (requests for information or submission of reports) and during the proceedings it launches. 
In the event of dispute proceedings being launched, the Group presents its case in the appropriate forums, in 
some cases presenting the Authority with undertakings that will reduce the alleged anti-competitive aspects 
at the center of the proceedings. After having assessed these undertakings, the Authority may make them 
compulsory and end the proceedings without imposing any financial penalty. 
Within the Company there are preventive controls on processes with potentially significant impacts in Antitrust 
terms such as, for example, the drawing-up of marketing plans, the development of contracts, conditions for 
the provision of telecommunication services, the development of the company’s information systems. The 
controls are aimed at ensuring that the operational management of the processes take into consideration 
these potential impacts.
In order to raise awareness and disseminate a correct approach to the subject, as a follow-up to the online 
training program launched in 2010, in 2013, management were offered a specific classroom training course on 
the application of competition law. In 2014, training activities continued for staff belonging to the department 
dealing with wholesale services.
The European Commission and a number of national competition authorities (including AGCM) have expressed 
their approval of the efforts made by companies that decide to adopt an effective compliance program. In 
Italy, growing interest in compliance programs is confirmed by the adoption of the Linee guida sulla modalità 
di applicazione dei criteri di quantificazione delle sanzioni amministrative pecuniarie irrogate dall’Autorità in 
applicazione dell’articolo 15, comma 1, della legge n. 287/90 [guidelines on the application of the quantification 
criteria for administrative fines imposed by the Authority pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, of Law No. 
287/90], in which AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) added, as one of the attenuating circumstances to 
be assessed when applying sanctions for antitrust offences “the adoption of and compliance with a specific 
compliance program that is suitable and in line with European and national best practice”.
For this reason, TIM realized a specific antitrust compliance program to complement the training activities 
already undertaken.
TIM adopted an antitrust compliance program in 2016. The activities for the development of the program, 
started in March 2015, are structured in the following phases:
■Interviews with senior staff previously identified by TIM;
■Checking of documents contained on the personal computers of a specific number of managers previously 
selected in order to perform an objective collection of such documents;
■Antitrust training (81 senior managers);
■Writing and adoption of a Competition Code of Conduct;
■Drafting and adoption of an internal procedure for the implementation of the compliance program under 
the scope of the company procedures (Antitrust Compliance Guidelines).
All activities were completed in September 2016: the explanatory report of the Antitrust Compliance Program, 
signed by Allen & Overy, the external firm that assisted TIM with preparing the Program, is dated October 17, 
2016.
In this area, we note the delivery of antitrust training (in blended mode, both on-line and in the classroom), 
which in 2016 involved more than 3,000 employees, identified on the basis of the criterion of exposure of the 
relevant Departments to possible antitrust risks. 
Another 177 senior managers were specifically trained in the classroom in the second half of 2017.
TIM has considered the need to integrate the 2016 compliance program following indications formalized by 
AGCM (the Italian Competition Authority) last October. Indeed, on October 4, 2018, AGCM (the Italian 
Competition Authority) published Guidelines on the assessment of compliance programs within antitrust 
proceedings.
There are multiple advantages of antitrust compliance. Investing in compliance with antitrust regulations not 
only reduces the Company’s exposure to pecuniary sanctions and requests for compensation for damages but 
also entails advantages and benefits for the companies’ own commercial strategies and operations. A properly 
focused and disseminated compliance program not only ensures, in the first place, that the antitrust risk is 
avoided and, therefore, the costs deriving from failure to comply with antitrust legislation, but may also allow 
the Company, if the crime has already been committed, to take suitable steps to put an end to the infraction. 
This could help limit the amount of the sanction with reference to the duration and severity of the offense. 
Another aspect to be considered is the reputational and image risk for TIM. 
The amount of a sanction potentially already assigned in antitrust proceedings may also be reduced.
The analysis of the Guidelines has highlighted the need to update the tools available to TIM, so that the 
Program can be considered adequate and, therefore, allow TIM to obtain the related benefits.
The need for integration mainly derives from the fact that, after adopting the program, TIM has been subject to 
antitrust proceedings, which are still in progress. It has therefore been necessary to supplement the program, 
with reference to the hypothesis of failure to comply with the legislation currently being examined by the 
Authority.
In October 2018, a project was launched to update the current Antitrust Compliance Program. 
The project contents stem from the gap analysis of the current situation with respect to the contents of the 
Guidelines and can be summarized as the following interventions:
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 170■Integrating the compliance program, focusing the Code of Conduct more closely on the situations 
concerned by new proceedings in progress and submitting it for approval by the company’s BoD;
■Ensuring a greater focus on and providing more information about the Compliance Program and the Code 
of Conduct, both within and outside the Company, with specific communication initiatives (e.g. publishing it 
on the Group’s institutional website, ensuring suitable media visibility);
■Involving the Company’s senior management more greatly as “endorsers” reminding about compliance 
with the program;
■Carrying out periodic audits on the implementation of the program, in a manner to be defined;
■Planning additional training sessions, again focused on the alleged offenses;
Additional interventions planned: definition of a structured method for the assessment and identification of 
antitrust risks and adoption of the relevant controls.
The new Antitrust Code of Conduct was approved by the TIM Board of Directors on March 20, 2019 and has 
been published on the company intranet and institutional website ( gruppotim.it/en/group/governance/
governance-tools/codes-policies.html ).
The new version of the Antitrust Code of Conduct and, more generally, the initiatives aimed at improving the 
antitrust compliance program have also been communicated within the company with a letter by the CEO 
addressed to all TIM employees and managers and published on the institutional website ( gruppotim.it/en/
group/governance/governance-tools/codes-policies.html ). By means of this letter, in particular, the CEO 
stressed and re-confirmed: the involvement of the company’s senior managers in the compliance program; the 
desire to adopt and implement virtuous behavioral models on all levels of the company in order to prevent 
possible violations of antitrust legislation; the role of the renewed Antitrust Code of Conduct as a set of rules 
and “compass” to direct the conduct of anyone working for the company; TIM’s commitment to translate the 
business culture of integrity and responsibility into virtuous conduct. 
A new internal communication and information campaign has also been developed, aimed at increasing the 
awareness of the antitrust risk and the level of knowledge on the matter, based on the dissemination of 
specific sheets (flanked by the related “teasers”), which briefly, using simple language, outline some of the 
topics of greatest interest for the Company in terms of antitrust matters.
In April 2019, a Head of the Antitrust Compliance Program was appointed, who: is a senior resource (the 
current Chief Regulatory Officer); is autonomous and independent and answers directly to the Board of 
Directors; entertains direct relations with the other competent departments on company compliance matters 
(auditing, compliance, corporate liability); is assigned specific resources and tools by which to perform his 
duties.
A joint Compliance Department - Regulatory Affairs/Antitrust Working Group has also been established, 
assigned the task of further refining and continuously updating the antitrust control model, starting with the 
definition of risks and the mapping of existing controls, including through a new cycle of interviews with senior 
managers.
In this context, a new mandatory training course has been prepared and launched, and is today still on-line, for 
all those working for the Group (approximately 42,000 people), with a specific new training document, which 
contains a series of questions to be answered correctly in order to complete the course.
The 2019 update of the compliance program resulted in a reduction in the sanction applied for two antitrust 
proceedings (A514 and I820) started respectively in 2017 and 2018. 
In this context and with a view to ensuring the continuous update of the Compliance program, new interviews 
with TIM’s senior managers have been prepared, planned and held.
The holding of the Interviews, with the aim of monitoring the antitrust risk and identifying any critical issues, 
has been considered necessary and appropriate, also in view of the change seen in many of TIM’s senior 
managers, as compared with the period in which the previous interviews were held.
The interviews were held from February to May 2020 for the first reports of the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Chairman, on the basis of a questionnaire specifically prepared, covering (with the necessary adjustments to 
take into account the areas of competence of the Interviewee) for example the topics on the awareness of 
TIM’s antitrust compliance initiatives, rather than relations with competitors or participation in trade 
associations or public and private tenders.
The results of the interviews provided a starting point for the definition of the forthcoming update of the 
antitrust risks and the identification of critical activities/processes to be overseen on the basis of the risks 
identified. 
In addition, from January to February 2020, a new classroom training session was held, specifically intended 
for the first and second levels of structure with a formula that, in addition to explaining the regulations and 
case law, involved the interactive participation of participants, called to make choices, on the basis of pre-
prepared options, faced with situations relevant to competition law. The choices of participants, expressed 
individually by means of APP, were then discussed under the scope of the same training session.  
In April 2021, the Antitrust Compliance Guidelines were updated, providing specific indications on the corporate 
procedures envisaged to ensure the effectiveness of the Antitrust Compliance Program and compliance with 
the Antitrust Code of Conduct. The document is available for all TIM employees in the Computerized 
Document System (SDI).
All TIM’s compliance activities have been designed, prepared and implemented with the support of external 
lawyers (Studio DLA Piper) and certified by them.
More details on the main provisions issued in respect of TIM S.p.A. are given in the paragraph on Legal 
Framework and Compliance of this report.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 171Regulatory initiatives regarding the access network
On November 5, 2015, the Group board approved a New Equivalence Model (NEM), aimed at further 
strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes for activating and maintaining the TIM fixed 
network wholesale access services supplied to its own commercial divisions and Operators.
On December 22, 2015, AGCom published Resolution 623/15/CONS containing a request to TIM to make a

unbundling and outsourcing of services related to provisioning and assurance. 
AGCom’s approval process for measures to strengthen the equal treatment guarantees, linked to Resolution 
623/15/CONS, concluded with AGCom issuing Resolutions 652/16/CONS and 321/17/CONS.
With the first Resolution, AGCom approved TIM's proposal made pursuant to Article 64, subsection 15, of 
Resolution 623/15/CONS, containing measures to strengthen the equivalence model.
The New Equivalence Model puts the sales divisions of TIM and the other Operators on an equal footing, 
ensuring full internal and external equality of treatment. TIM, in fact, through the Wholesale Department, 
provides basic access services (LLU, SLU and VULA) to its TIM Retail Department and OAOs under the same 
terms and conditions, with the same timing, and using the same systems and processes. 
With the Resolution 321/17/CONS of July 27, 2017, AGCom defined the processes for the “unbundling” of 
accessory provisioning and assurance services of the LLU (Local Loop Unbundling) and SLU (Sub-Loop 
Unbundling) services, to guarantee greater transparency and flexibility in the operating processes as requested 
by alternative operators and the authorities, but in full compliance with restrictions on the integrity, 
functionality and security of the fixed network.
With the approval of Resolution 348/19/CONS of August 08, 2019 relative to the analysis of the market of local 
and central wholesale access services in fixed stations, AGCom has decreed that competition effectively exists 
in the municipality of Milan and has revoked the obligations assigned to TIM by resolution no. 623/15/CONS and 
related implementing Resolutions (321/17/CONS and 652/16/CONS); consequently, TIM, in the municipality of 
Milan, is no longer an operator with Significant Market Power (SMP).
Equally, starting August 08, 2019, the Undertakings relating to the SMP services pursuant to Annex A to 
Resolution 718/08/CONS ceased effect as, moreover, envisaged by points 16.6 (cessation for failure to notify 
SMP operator) and 16.7 (cessation limited to specific product markets or geographic markets on which the 
qualification of SMP operator ceases) of the Commitments.
The same Resolution 348/19/CONS extended the unbundling pursuant to Resolution 321/17/CONS also to 
include the VULA-C service.
On August 31, 2020, TIM’s Board of Directors approved the agreement with KKR Infrastructure and Fastweb for 
the establishment of FiberCop, a NewCo to which TIM’s secondary network will be conferred (from the roadside 
cabinets to customers’ homes) along with the fiber network developed by FlashFiber, the joint venture in which 
TIM has an 80% and Fastweb a 20% stake. 
Following this decision, on September 02, 2020 TIM notified AGCom a project for voluntary legal separation, 
integrated on November 25, 2020, in accordance with Article 50-ter of the Electronic Communications Code 
(ECC) correlated with the establishment of Fibercop.
Consequent to the notification received and in compliance with the provisions of Article 50-ter of the ECC, with 
Resolution 637/20/CONS dated November 26, 2020, AGCom started investigation proceedings for a public 
consultation regarding the voluntary legal separation notified by TIM and the coordinated analysis of the fixed 
network access services markets, in order to assess the regulatory impact of the voluntary legal separation 
project of the fixed access network notified by TIM.
The results of the public consultation on the voluntary separation project of the TIM fixed access network, 
notified to the Authority - in accordance with Article 50-ter of the ECC - on September 02, 2020, as 
supplemented on November 25, 2020, were published on October 12, 2021 by Resolution no. 253/21/CONS.
These results will be incorporated for the preparation of the draft provision for the coordinated analysis of the 
fixed network access services markets that will be submitted to national public consultation in accordance with 
Article 11 of the ECC.
By Resolution no. 412/21/CONS of December 21, 2021, AGCom extended by ninety days the terms for the 
investigation procedure started by Resolution no. 637/20/CONS concerning the coordinated analysis of the 
markets of access services to the fixed network in accordance with Article 50-ter of the Code.
Relations with the market and sector authorities in Brazil
In Brazil, TIM SA maintains participatory and collaborative relations with ANATEL ( Agência Nacional de 
Telecomunicações ) and CADE (Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica ), the authorities dealing 
respectively with the telecommunication sector and the competition and markets. With ANATEL, TIM SA has 
an extremely cooperative and participatory interaction aimed at cooperating with the evolution of dialog on 
the best TLC regulatory framework for the sector and general economic growth. The main aim is to collaborate 
with ANATEL in identifying the most relevant topics and eliminating the barriers to the sector’s development, 
particularly by contributing towards the evolution of the main regulatory sections, such as, amongst others, 
management of frequencies, quality of service, interconnection and sharing of networks, coverage of rural 
zones, digital agenda. TIM SA also maintains a cooperative and transparent relationship with CADE. The 
Company is obliged to notify the Board of mergers, acquisitions and agreements as well as to promptly provide 
all the information necessary or requested. In addition to this, TIM SA promotes debates and studies and 
collaborates with academic institutions in order to support research on the country’s competition policies. As 
regards the sector associations, the most important in which TIM SA operates are: 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 172■ABR Telecom (the Brazilian association of telecommunications resources), which is dedicated to the 
centralized management of technological solutions in a shared environment, creating value for 
telecommunications service suppliers;
■EAD ( Entidade Administradora da Digitalização de Canais TV e RTV ), responsible for the migration to digital 
TV and the switch-off of analog TV, communications and the distribution of decoders and antennas 
intended for low-income families with a view to the implementation of LTE at 700 MHz;
■Conexis Brasil Digital (National association of TLC operators), which deals with the coordination, defense 
and legal representation of the associates and includes all fixed and mobile telephone operators;
■GSMA, which represents the interests of mobile telephone operators worldwide and, on a regional level, 
GSMA Latin America, is an essential partner in global discussions about, for example, the management 
and assignment of radio frequencies, specifications of international requirements for the ITU and also in 
connection with consumer protection and activities that go towards improving the sector’s general 
reputation (TIM takes part in the “We Care” initiative)
■ConectarAgro ( Rede ConectarAgro ), which represents the agricultural food companies and

[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 411] [GRI 412]  The 
materiality analysis, conducted by TIM in 2021, confirmed the promotion and protection of Human Rights as a 
material topic for stakeholders and for the Group, along the entire “value chain”. This result, which may seem 
unusual for a telecommunications operator that works in countries considered to be at low/medium risk of 
Human Rights violations, is based on two sets of reasons:
■the broad meaning TIM assigns to the concept of “Human Right”. This sphere includes not only basic 
Human Rights common to all industrial sectors, such as the right to fair remuneration, non-discrimination, 
the right to not resort to forced/compulsory/bonded work, etc., but also Human Rights specific to a 
telecommunications company, such as the right to access information, freedom of expression (in particular 
online), protection of privacy and safety online, and protection of children (from cyberbullying, for 
example);
■the public outcry caused by Human Rights violation incidents, which can seriously affect business 
reputation.

adhered to the Global Compact in 2002; from 2012 to 2019, TIM was one of the members of The Human Rights 
Peer Learning Group (PLG)1, formed under the scope of the Global Compact Network Germany. 
In order to strengthen its commitment to the protection of Human Rights, TIM has implemented, inter alia:
■Human Rights due diligence;
■the “Respecting Human Rights in the TIM Group” policy;
■information and training on Human Rights.

Due Diligence 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] Among the 
objectives of due diligence on Human Rights are:
■the identification and mapping of Human Rights risks resulting from the company’s operations; 
■confirmation that each topic is assigned to a responsible body (governance), is governed by a specific 
internal regulatory framework (e.g. policy, procedure), has a management system that regularly monitors 
and traces the performances (if possible through the appropriate indicators, such as those concerning 
health and safety);
■the definition of a gradual improvement path which, starting with simple respect for the local laws, guides 
the policies and processes of Human Rights towards sharing with the appropriate stakeholders through 
appropriate involvement initiatives;
■the highlighting of any gaps or inconsistencies between the company’s various departments and/or 
between the different companies of the Group;
■the possibility to discuss Human Rights with the other companies.
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1741 PLG is a learning platform and active leadership for European companies, where the meetings take place in respect of the Chatham House Rule.[GRI 412-1] TIM carried out the first due diligence on Human Rights (concluded in 2014) using the tool OCAI2, 
and the involvement of the Group’s two biggest entities in terms of workforce and investments, in other words 
the Domestic BU3 (the percentage covered was 98% as it excluded Olivetti and TIM Sparkle) and the Brazil BU. 
The Sustainability Metrics & Performance Index Analysis Department examined the questionnaires that had 
been filled in and conducted the related feedback with the Italian departments in order to further examine the 
contributions provided and define the action plans for the level two and three self-assessments (respectively 
3.1% and 8.6% of all the responses)4. 
In Italy, after feedback, the results were as follows:
■on a scale of one to six, the average score of all the answers was 4.4;
■the need to prepare the TIM Group’s Human Rights policy (around 2/3 of the insufficient self-assessments 
regarded this aspect);
■the usefulness of organizing internal Human Rights training courses.
In 2021 TIM S.A.  conducted new due diligence on human rights based on the Human Rights Capacity 
Diagnostic (HRCD) questionnaire of Global Compact, to verify its level of engagement and management of the 
issue. The average result remained 3, on a scale of 1 to 6, which is an efficient level of operational maturity. No 
corrective actions were identified as necessary by the due diligence process. The Parent Company included in 
the 2022-24 ESG Plan, presented to the financial community in March 2022, the plan for new due diligence on 
human rights, on conclusion of which the policy and the current information and training courses available on 
the Group e-learning platform will be reinterpreted. Once this process is completed, the Remediation Manual 
will be finalized.   
[GRI 414-1] [GRI 414-2] The results of the audit on Human Rights carried out on the suppliers of the Group are 
set out in this document and on the Group’s website.
For the 2022-24 ESG Plan, the Group is committed to revising the due diligence process, and, once completed, 
reinterpreting the Policy on the Respect for Human Rights, and the related information and training courses, as 
well as completing the Remediation Manual. 
Human Rights Policy
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] The Policy 
applies to every individual within the Group and also concerns Third Parties who have business dealings with 
TIM.
The Policy, issued in 20155, aims to make respect for Human Rights an essential requirement in the 
performance of TIM’s operational activities. Both in Italy and in foreign companies, the Group has set up 
processes through which it undertakes to respect Human Rights and has identified those that may be 
negatively influenced by the Company’s activities, such as:
■[GRI 403-3] [GRI 406-1] [GRI 408-1] [GRI 409-1]  Human rights common to all industry sectors (e.g. rights 
concerning health and safety at work6, diversity, equality and non-discrimination, working hours, fair pay, 
minimum age for starting work, accessibility for disabled people, maternity protection, forced/compulsory/
restricted labor, the zero tolerance approach to any form of corruption, the rights of our customers to 
responsible advertising, rights related to the use of armed security, according to the highest international 
standards and practices);
■[GRI 407-1]  rights agreed with the unions and included in National Labour Agreements (in line with the 
principles of the International Labour Organization).
The Group’s internal processes also focus on a series of individual rights affected by the core business, 
including the rights:
■associated with access to telecommunications services and innovation;
■[GRI 418] associated with the privacy of the Group’s employees, customers and suppliers, and the 
protection of their personal data;
■associated with freedom of expression, in particular online, supported by access to telecommunications 
technologies;
■potentially violated by added value services (for example, services with content reserved for adults and 
gambling);
■of children and young people to be protected from (cyber)bullying or harassment;
■associated with environmental protection (in particular electromagnetic fields);
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 1752 Organizational Capacity Assessment Instrument, created by Twentyfifty Ltd. with funding from the Global Compact Network Germany 
Foundation. OCAI, which does not operate as an expert in compliance:
• fully reflects the “UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights;”
• takes into account the interpretations provided by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights;
• this is a self-assessment questionnaire containing twenty two questions where, for each question, the company/department must assess its 
own position, current and potential, on a spectrum of six levels that range from “non-responsive” to “Human Rights promoter.”

customers, Protection of customers of the universal telephony service.
4 No level one response was supplied during the first round.
5 Available in Italian and English on the TIM S.p.A. website and in Brazilian and English on the TIM S.A. website.
6 As regards the Italian businesses, to join TIM you must have a secondary school diploma and, thus, be an adult. In Brazil, apprenticeship contracts 
are envisaged, thus also offered to minors. For companies that operate abroad (for example, TISparkle) the same methods set out for Italy apply. ■of the communities in which TIM carries out business, with particular attention to vulnerable groups of 
people (e.g. disabled people, minors, the elderly, women).
The Policy sets out the unfiltered and anonymous reporting mechanisms in line with the requirements of the 
company procedures (specifically, that relating to “whistleblowing”), available on the Group’s website.
The efficiency and monitoring of the Human Rights Policy, approved by the Chairman of TIM, is ensured by the 
Human Resources, Organization & Real Estate Department, responsible for its observance as regards the 
involvement of TIM’s people; the Procurement Department, responsible for seeing it is complied with by 
suppliers; the Compliance Department, which monitors the risk of non-compliance with the reference 
legislation; and the Sustainability Metrics & Performance Index Analysis Department, responsible for updating 
the Policy. 
TIM Group Non-financial statement Social 176(In)Formation and Training on Human Rights
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] Following the 
publication of the Policy, in 2015 an on-line course was realized for the whole of the company population, 
available since end 2015. The course, updated in autumn 2018, is available on the TIM Academy e-learning 
platform for Group employees and - from July 2019 - for all stakeholders (in Italian only) at the URL1 
dirittiumani.gruppotim.it .
The on-line information/training course on Human Rights highlights, amongst others:
■what Human Rights are and the main international Institutions that govern them;
■businesses and Human Rights, focusing on any impact their business activities may have on Human Rights;
■the importance of businesses that operate in the telecommunications industry in the defense of Human 
Rights;
■TIM and Human Rights: what can be done - in the case of doubt - by individuals of the Group for the 
protection of Human Rights;
■how and when to use the reporting mechanism.
In 2018 in Brazil TIM S.A. made a version of the course respecting the local context available to all its 
employees on the “Talent Hub Aprendizagem” online training platform.  Among its aims were to broaden 
knowledge of the subject among employees, in particular to highlight how Human Rights feature in day to day 
work. 
TIM S.A. continued with its efforts to disseminate a more inclusive culture within the Company, in accordance 
with the Diversity & Inclusion Plan (D&I). In 2021, for the second year in a row, TIM S.A. sponsored and took part 
in AfroPresença, an online event promoted by the Office of the Ministry of Labor and by the United Nations 
Global Compact to disseminate work opportunities for black university students. 
[GRI 412-2] Training activities mainly regarded the dissemination of the Group Policy on the Respect for Human 
Rights, specifically the standards for health and safety at work.
The Group's training hours on Human Rights for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are available in the appendix to the 
“Human Capital” chapter of this report.

[GRI 103-3: Management Approach]  The Group’s Code of Ethics and Conduct requires employees, collaborators 
and consultants, as well as third parties who have business relations with the TIM Group - in respect of 
activities and services of interest to the Group - to promptly inform the Chief Audit Executive of TIM, either 
directly or via their line manager, of any violations or collusion to violate:
■legal or regulatory requirements,
■provisions of the Code of Ethics and Conduct,
■internal policies and procedures,
■any irregularities and/or negligence. 
The Group Code of Ethics and Conduct requires that addressees of the Code and those who have adhered to it 
promptly report to the Chief Audit Executive of Telecom Italia S.p.A. or of foreign subsidiary directly concerned, 
using the internal procedures for this purpose: 
■any violation, request or inducement to violate applicable laws and regulations, the provisions of this Code 
or internal procedures, with reference to activities and services of interest to the Group;
■every irregularity or negligence in keeping books and records or fulfilling obligations of financial or internal 
reporting in Group companies.
The handling of the above reports, also specifically those under the responsibility of the 231 Supervisory Body 
(known as whistleblowing), which avails of the preparatory activities of the Chief Audit Executive, includes 
certain processes of the “UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights”; in Italy this particular case is 
regulated by Law No. 179/2017 (Provisions on the protection of parties reporting offenses or irregularities they 
become aware of in the context of a public or private employment relationship). 
The “Whistleblowing” procedure requires the Chief Audit Executive, who carries out the preliminary activities 
on behalf of the 231 Supervisory Body and answers directly to the Board of Directors, autonomously and 
independently of the senior executives:
■to ensure that incoming complaints are received, logged and undergo preliminary analysis;
■based on the results of the preliminary analysis, to launch a structured audit activity (if required);
■to communicate the results of the analyses to the relevant departments so that they may take the 
appropriate corrective actions (if required). The non-compliance is only closed once the Audit Department 
has verified the effectiveness of the corrective actions implemented by the relevant departments;
■to ensure the traceability and retention of the documentation regarding the complaints received and their 
analysis;
■to update the reporting procedure and disseminate it internally together with the Human Resources, 
Organization & Real Estate Department.
Employees were made aware of this in a letter from the CEO and a news item published on the company 
Intranet.
In 2021, a total of 141 complaints were received in Italy and 1,924 in Brazil. 
In the case of Italy, of the 141 complaints, 26 were anonymous and 115 non-anonymous - classified as follows: 
■50 in the context of the “Whistleblowing2” procedure;
■91 not covered by the procedure (complaints, requests for information and clarification, as well as spam) 
sent to the relevant departments for the respective checks, informing the Audit Department of the result 
of the checks.
In the case of Brazil, of the 1,924 complaints, 690 were anonymous and 1,234 non-anonymous, classified as 
follows:
■857 in the context of the “Whistleblowing3” procedure;
■913 customer complaints (poor service, etc.);
■154 "not inherent" to the objective of the procedure.
Below are the Human Rights-related complaints received through the tool which TIM provides for all 
stakeholders to report any kind of regulatory irregularity or breach of the Code of Ethics and Conduct, and of 
the Human Rights Policy, i.e. the “Whistleblowing” procedure, available both on the company intranet and on

[GRI 406-1]  With regard to the sole substantiated complaint in Italy, in 2021 the action plan implemented 
consisted of disqualifying the reported party (not an employee) from future dealings with TIM. As a result, the 
disclosure on the action plans that have been implemented, with results verified through routing internal 
management audit processes, does not seem applicable, considering the type of action reported. 
As regards Brazil, protocol requires the involvement of the Human Resources and Safety Department. Cases of 
discrimination in 2021 were investigated by analyzing the number of complaints received by the TIM 
complaints channel. Complaints are received through a system that uses a specialized company external to 
TIM S.A. After the complaint is received, Human Resources and Safety take action, in addition to activating the 
dedicated internal channels. The complainant receives a protocol number, to be used to monitor the status of 
his/her complaint. All cases deemed substantiated receive specific corrective measures, which are the 
responsibility of the Human Resources Department, and, based on their seriousness, the Legal Department is 
also involved.

The new regulatory framework
The EU Taxonomy (EU 2020/852)  is a classification system introduced as part of the European Green Deal as 
an enabling tool for achieving the environmental and climate targets set out in the Pact, specifically 
decarbonization by 2050. 
By setting out specific indications on economic activities that can be classified as environmentally sustainable, 
the regulations intend to guide the issue of transparency for investors and combat greenwashing, while 
supporting company organizations in planning their energy transitions and adopting sustainable 
environmental policies. 
The European Taxonomy defines six environmental objectives, the first two of which have been fully regulated 
to date: climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. 
In terms of law, the regulation introduces a new disclosure obligation targeted to large public interest entities 
that draw up an NFS in compliance with the application of Legislative Decree 254/2016. 
TIM’s position
TIM was in favor of the introduction of the European Taxonomy, understanding the new regulatory framework 
as an instrument capable of offering the world of investors and all stakeholders a benchmark for common, 
comparable reference. 
In addition to immediately launching all the actions necessary to align its reporting system with the new 
regulations, TIM actively participated in the consultation process, providing its contributions through sector 
associations in which the Group participates1.
TIM Group Non-financial statement European Taxonomy 1821 EtnoHow TIM has adopted the European Taxonomy
Based on the indications in the Delegated Acts, the final versions of which were published in June 2021, a two-
phase process was developed, which first assessed the applicability of the Taxonomy by analyzing the entire 
business model of the Group, then launched the operations of reporting on the activities surveyed. Considering 
the phases set out in the roadmap for applying the Regulation, in 2021 the focus of the process exclusively 
regarded the objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation, considered based on the eligibility 
criterion. Therefore, business activities were divided into the following two categories:
■Eligible activities : economic activities explicitly included in the Taxonomy regulation because they 
substantially contribute to climate change mitigation or adaptation; 
■Non-eligible activities : all the economic activities excluded from the regulation because they do not 
substantially contribute to climate change mitigation or adaptation.
Thus, the three key performance indicators required by the Regulation were calculated, i.e. the share of 
revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenses associated with economic activities considered 
environmentally sustainable . For more details on the reporting method, see the section “Methodological 
Note”.
Lastly, TIM also launched the study of the additions to processes required to meet the disclosure obligations 
prescribed starting from FY 2022, which will require the application of an additional technical examination for 
each of the activities surveyed (alignment with the Taxonomy). 
It is expected that the entry into force of the technical criteria for screening will, in future years, result in a 
tightening of the selection of the activities aligned with the Taxonomy criteria and a resulting decrease in the 
performance indicators. Moreover, TIM’s approach in identifying eligible activities was focused on rigorous 
compliance with the regulation guidelines, resulting in the exclusion of projects not clearly set out in the 
Delegated Acts of the Regulation.

METHODOLOGICAL NOTE
As noted in the previous sections, the reporting process took shape in two phases:
Survey of eligible activities: the main company activities of the TIM Group were analyzed and mapped and, 
in particular, investment projects and commercial offers. For each activity identified, the related descriptive 
materials, necessary for the final assessment, were collected and filed. In order to identify the eligible activities, 
the following categories set out in the Delegated Acts of the regulation were used as reference:
■Climate change mitigation:
•8.1   Data processing, hosting and related activities
•8.2   Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions
•7.2   Renovation of existing buildings
•4.1   Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology
■Climate change adaptation:
•8.1   Data processing, hosting and related activities
•8.2   Computer programing, consultancy and related activities
•8.3   Programming and broadcasting activities
In the tables shown above, the activities were aggregated based on that classification. 
Final accounting of the economic values and determination of the numerators and denominators of the 
KPIs : for all the activities surveyed, the values relating to the three indicators to be represented (revenues, 
capex and opex) were accounted for. Based on the indications set out in the Delegated Acts of the regulation, 
the values were reported based on the following accounting criteria:
■KPI 1 -  Revenues   (Net turnover): all the “eligible” items of revenues referring to Consolidated Financial 
Statement Note no. 25:
•revenues net of any discounts granted to customers, value added tax and other taxes
■KPI 2 -  CapEx : all the “eligible” capital expenditure items referring to Consolidated Financial Statement 
Note no. 5 - 6- 7:
•intangible and tangible investments 
•capitalized rights of use  
TIM Group Non-financial statement European Taxonomy 186•increases in lease contracts
■KPI 3 -  OpEx : all the “eligible” operating expenditure items referring to Consolidated Financial Statement 
Note no.  27 - 43:
•expenses for purchases of goods and services (maintenance, consulting, energy consumption, etc.)
•lease and rental costs (rents, leases, charges, etc.)
•research and development (including the costs for dedicated personnel)
The numerator of each  KPI equals the sum of the values referring to the eligible activities (in the tables: 
Section A - “Eligible activities under the Taxonomy”).  
The denominator of each of the three  KPIs refers to the total values identified in the same financial statement 
notes listed above, and is indicated in the tables in the row “Total A + B” (eligible activities + non-eligible 
activities).
The ratio of the numerators to the denominators provides the percentage of the total eligible activities under 
the Taxonomy out of the total company activities. As mentioned, the scope of reporting consists of the entire 
TIM Group.

TIM Group Non-financial statement Appendix 190Duties and taxes 
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 103-3: Management Approach] 
[GRI 207-1]  The approach to taxation comes under the Ethics and Corporate Governance material topic. In the 
TIM Group, tax governance is inspired by the principles contained in the Group Code of Conduct and Ethics. The 
Tax Department is responsible for managing tax matters and this reports to the General Counsel. The Tax 
Strategy represents the approach defined by the Board of Directors to managing tax matters and the Tax 
Policy, which regulates the company’s tax governance, is revised every two years. The tax approach is aligned 
with the business strategies that comprise the sustainable development goals through the Three-Year ESG 
Plan.
[GRI 207-2] Tax governance, control and management of the risk. This management mainly includes:
■tax compliance, in terms of direct execution or supervision;
■support, in terms of tax consultancy, given to the TIM Group business;
■the defense of TIM Group companies in the event of tax disputes;
■the management and prevention of tax risks through an internal control system of the tax risk (the “Tax 
Control Framework”); in this sense, work in the tax sector is included in the systems and in the general risk 
control procedures adopted by the Group, as well as in the general programs and activities of Audit and 
Compliance;
■the active contribution to the technical discussions on an international level and under the scope of 
international institutions and organizations, on tax policy matters (both general and linked to the specific 
sector).
In general terms, TIM believes that complete transparency in regard to the financial administrations is part of 
its duties as a taxpayer, also in terms of social responsibility.
At the same time, TIM believes that complete compliance with tax obligations, by all companies competing on 
the various markets, is not only a duty of all taxpayers but also a necessary condition for there to be fair 
competition between companies that face and compete with each other on the same markets.
The commitment to transparency is reflected in the work of the TIM Group in the tax field, as indicated in the 
Tax Strategy document.
In detail, the TIM Group undertakes:
■to operate according to principles of honesty, correctness and compliance with tax legislation, behaving 
collaboratively and transparently in regard to the financial administration and third parties, so as to 
minimize any substantive impact in terms of the tax risk;
■to operate always in compliance with the letter and the spirit of the tax legislation in force in the countries 
in which it operates; to this end, it speaks in advance with the Italian Revenues Agency about any 
potentially disputable matters or those of dubious interpretation in the case of complex corporate, 
financial or commercial transactions with results that are relevant in terms of taxation, regardless of any 
hypothesis of potential abuse of the right/elusiveness of a transaction and also in the event of possible 
non-application of anti-avoidance rules; 
■to apply transfer pricing policies aimed at avoiding the erosion of taxable income, through the alignment of 
the location of taxable income with the place in which the economic business is carried out and respect of 
the arm's length principle; 
■not to establish companies located in tax havens;
■not to adopt aggressive tax planning systems.
The Company regularly specifies, in its annual financial statements, all tax items and expenses.
[GRI 207-3] In the materiality matrix, the topic is included in corporate conduct. To date, the Group has not 
received any solicitation from its stakeholders in regard to tax aspects. Should such occur, they will be 
processed by the company departments assigned to deal with the relevant compliance matters.
[GRI 207-4] Country by Country reporting shows, for each of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates 
permanently with its subsidiaries, the income tax expense paid locally (millions of euros) on the basis of the 
cash criterion. In 2021, for the TIM Group, income tax expense has a negative balance of 3,885 million euros 
(positive for 5,955 million euros in 2020). Tax expense mainly relates to the write-off of 50% of the IRES 
deferred tax assets and the entire amount of the IRES deferred taxes entered in 2020 in exchange for the tax 
recognition of higher values booked to the financial statements in accordance with Decree Law 104/2020, Art. 
110, paragraphs 8 and 8 bis; this write-off is due to the extension to 50 years of the period of tax asset 
resorption introduced by Art. 160 of the 2022 Budget Law (Law 234/2021) and the changed assessment of the 
recoverability of deferred tax assets on the basis of the current forecast of TIM S.p.A.’s future income.
