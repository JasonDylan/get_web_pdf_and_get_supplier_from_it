PROGRESS REPORT  
2016ABOUT THIS  
REPORT 
Cummins’ 2016 Sustainability Progress Report reflects  
the company’s broad view of sustainability, including  
the environment, corporate responsibility, diversity  
and inclusion, innovation and financial performance. 
The company supports the United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals to “end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all.”  
We hope you’ll see that the disclosures included in this report align with  
those aspirations.
We’ve made some changes in this year’s report. A lot of the feature stories  
that formerly ran here regarding how our employees work towards those  
goals have been moved to Cummins’ social media site, The Block.  Our hope is that the Progress Report is a now easy-to-read summary  
of the company’s sustainability performance in 2016.
This year’s report also includes a new section on serving our customers.  
After going through our first formal materiality study in 2015, the report  
team came to the conclusion that customers were a key stakeholder in  
the company’s sustainability that weren’t adequately reflected in the pages  of our report.  We’re still working on what this content should look like in  
the future, but excited to be better representing this critical stakeholder.
Finally, some data and information that used to run in this report have  
been moved to Cummins’ GRI Data Book to try and improve the  
readability of the report.
This report was posted in June 2016 and is Cummins’ 14th edition. 
Blair Claflin, Director – Sustainability CommunicationsCUMMINS GRI DATA BOOK
Cummins is again producing a separate data book, although  
its name is changing slightly. This report is now called Cummins’ GRI Data Book reflecting our attempt to closely follow the 
format of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Established by the 
United Nations, the GRI’s goal is to develop a consistent way for companies to report on their environmental, social and economic performance. This report will be posted by the end of June.
SUSTAINABILITY OVERVIEW
Cummins has also put together an eight-panel  sustainability brochure to give readers a very  quick look at Cummins’ sustainability efforts.  
The overview is posted with our other reports.

THE COVER 
Through the rolling hills of southern Indiana, railroad buffs 
watched as the distinctive red and black Cummins’ QSK95 
locomotive pulled coal and mixed freight along the Indiana 
Rail Road in 2016. But it might be what they didn’t see that’s more impressive.
The Cummins locomotive recorded a 16 percent 
improvement in fuel economy compared to the engine  it replaced, an 89 percent reduction in oxides of  
nitrogen and a 98 percent cut in particulate matter.
The engine has already been selected to power  
Siemens’ ultra-low emission Charger Locomotive  
about to begin passenger service in several  
locations in the United States. Cummins  re-powered a 40-year-old freight locomotive  
to show the QSK95 can haul freight, too.
Read about what some call the company’s  
“mobile locomotive testing lab.” It’s just  
one of the ways Cummins is working to  
innovate on behalf of its customers.

 Workforce A NOTE FROM  
THE CHAIRMAN
Despite challenging market conditions, 2016 was a 
remarkable year for Cummins. We continued to focus 
on improving our company in every respect during the 
tough times, while making strategic investments in new technologies to ensure that we are better positioned than 
anyone else when markets return. And we did this while 
maintaining our deep commitment to sustainability. 
Here are just a few examples: 
 »We launched the X15 heavy-duty, on-highway truck engine, offering  
up to 20 percent better fuel economy and lower maintenance costs 
compared to Cummins’ 2010 ISX15 diesel engine.  
 »Our QSK95 engines began powering the new diesel-electric Charger 
locomotives built by Siemens. These ultra-low emission locomotives  will be used by passenger rail systems across the United States. 
 »Cummins partnered on a project to develop a Class 6 medium-duty,  plug-in, hybrid-electric truck that can reduce fuel consumption  by at least 50 percent. The project was awarded a $4.5 million  research grant by the U.S. Department of Energy. 
These achievements all resulted from Cummins’ continued spirit  
of innovation and our pledge that everything we do lead to  
a cleaner, healthier, safer environment.

Chairman and CEO Tom 
Linebarger also addresses sustainability at  Cummins in an essay for the Business 
Roundtable on page 47 of 
“Create, Grow, Sustain”  at sustainability.brt.orgOver the years, Cummins’ prosperity 
has become increasingly linked to our ability to produce the cleanest, most 
fuel-efficient engines, generators and 
components in the world. We want to provide customers with the power they need, while helping them meet 
their business and environmental 
challenges wherever they operate. 
We also make similar commitments 
in our supply chains, our facilities 
and our communities, relying on the 
capability and innovative nature of our people to achieve amazing results – using less energy, water and other 
critical materials, while producing 
more at lower costs. I am troubled, however, by two recent developments. 
Support seems to be waning in some 
places for enforcing and enacting 
standards to protect our natural resources. Clean air and water are vital to creating healthy communities, 
which are critical to a vibrant 
business climate. The employees Cummins needs to succeed want to live in healthy communities, and healthy communities ultimately result 
in stronger markets for our products.  
It is important that we reduce or remove unnecessary, overlapping or poorly written and enforced 
regulations that harm business 
growth and innovation. 
At the same time, I’m also concerned 
about the increased apprehension regarding global trade. The ability 
to grow and provide high quality 
jobs is central to Cummins’ view of sustainability. We exported more than $2 billion worth of products from the 
United States in 2016, supporting thousands of U.S. jobs. We need 
more trade, not less to help our business and communities to grow. 
I truly believe that a company is 
only sustainable when it achieves economic success while acting as social and environmental stewards. 
It’s a goal I hope you’ll see reflected  
in the pages of this report. 
Thank you for your interest  
in Cummins,

10OUR KEY  
TOOLS
SIX SIGMA AND  
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
Cummins is a big proponent of Six 
Sigma, using the business improvement  
tool to save the company and its 
customers billions of dollars.
Six Sigma uses data-based analysis  
to identify defects and variation  in a wide range of manufacturing  
and business situations. Since its  
introduction at Cummins in 2000:
 »Approximately 23,000 people have been trained on Six Sigma  
tools at the company, including more than 11,700 current  professional employees.
 »Six Sigma projects have identified an estimated $6.65 billion  in PBIT (Profit Before Interest and Tax) savings over the  tool’s 16-year history at Cummins.
 »Cummins Customers have saved an estimated $1.41 billion  through Six Sigma since the tool was first offered to them in 2005.Cummins also uses Six Sigma in its community work, helping its community 
partners address problems. Employees completed 74 Community Impact  Six Sigma projects on behalf of their community partners in 2016.
The impact of Six Sigma on the company goes beyond cost savings and 
community engagement. It has provided Cummins with a common language and a collective mindset that can be used to address a problem or challenge almost anywhere in the world.
In 2016, the company announced some changes to its Six Sigma program, 
bringing in some additional improvement tools to the training. Now called  “Six Sigma and Continuous Improvement,” this new approach is designed  to keep projects targeted at Cummins’ most important business problems.  The company’s top leaders play a key role in determining Six Sigma priorities 
with a special focus on product quality, working capital, distributor synergies, 
direct material cost reductions and telematics.
After 16 years as a key part of the company, Six Sigma has established itself  
as the principal problem solving tool used at Cummins.CUMMINS 
OPERATING  SYSTEM
The Cummins Operating System 
helps develop common practices and approaches to improve customer 
satisfaction. The 10 practices are:
 »Put the customer first and 
provide real value.
 »Synchronize flows (material, physical and information).
 »Design quality in every step  of the process.
 »Involve people and promote team work.
 »Ensure equipment and tools  are available and capable.
 »Create functional excellence.
 »Establish the right environment.
 »Treat preferred suppliers  as partners.
 »Follow common problem solving techniques.
 »Use Six Sigma as the primary process improvement method.

13CUMMINS ESTABLISHES  
NEW GOALS TO IMPROVE  
THE ENVIRONMENT 
Cummins continued making progress on reducing its environmental impact in  
2016, especially in water and energy. The company established new 2020 goals  
in those areas, having reached previous targets. 
“The environmental teams around the globe worked hard on making progress on  
our established goals and setting two new aggressive ones,” said Mark Dhennin,  
Cummins’ Director of Energy Efficiency and Environment. 
The progress came against a 
backdrop of company growth.  Since 2010, Cummins’ in-scope 
facilities increased by 250 sites to 
more than 450 locations by the end of 2016. The increase in footprint was due to the addition of new office 
buildings, regional distribution centers 
and the acquisition of the company’s North American distributors.  Here’s a progress report on  
each of the environmental goals Cummins has established.
Cummins released its first water 
conservation goal in 2014 as part of its 2020 Environmental Sustainability 
Plan, pledging to reduce water use 
intensity by 33 percent, adjusted by labor hours. By the end of 2016, the company's water efficiency efforts 
had resulted in a 42 percent water 
intensity reduction or 18 percent on an absolute basis. Because Cummins achieved its initial water goal ahead  of schedule, the company announced a revised goal on World Water  Day, March 22, 2017.
The revised 50 percent intensity 
reduction goal represents a  potential total water savings of  more than 760 million gallons  
of water since 2010.
“Thanks to the hard work of our 
employees around the world,  we surpassed our initial target,  but we know we should do more  
so we are raising the bar with our 
revised goal,” said Brian Mormino, Executive Director of Environmental Strategy and Compliance. 
The United Nations estimates that by 
2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity and two-thirds of the world’s population could be living 
under water-stressed conditions. 
Projections show that by 2040,  all of the United States will be considered highly water stressed.
“Businesses can’t operate, and 
people can’t live, without water,”  said Mormino. “We have a responsibility to come together  
WATER
Goals:
 »Reduce direct water  
use across Cummins  
by 50 percent by 2020, 
adjusted for hours worked. 
 »Achieve water neutrality

Cummins has been 
working to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases from its facilities 
since 2006 when the 
company joined the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Leaders program and set its first goal for 2010.ENVIRONMENT // GOALSin collective action, and Cummins  
is committed to being part of  the solution.”
In 2016, Cummins used 934 million 
gallons of water, a 13 million gallon decrease from 2015. Since the goal’s baseline year of 2010, direct water 
use is down by 18 percent, while 
water use adjusted for hours worked is down by 42 percent despite an increase in the number of in-scope facilities during the period.
Cummins’ water neutrality work is 
also progressing well. Seven sites toward the company’s goal of  15 have now been validated as  
water neutral, off-setting their water 
use with community improvements that either conserve water or make new sources available. 
The company continues to  
promote awareness about the 
connection between water use in  its plants and community needs.  Over the past year, Cummins’  
efforts have been focused on 
validating calculation methodologies using site-implemented projects  and defining project roadmaps leading to goal achievement.OUR WATER JOURNEY

Cummins uses a tool 
that calculates the true cost of water, including the cost associated with 
risk and energy needed 
to pump water.Cummins in 2016 approved  
its third energy goal in 10 years  
after exceeding its second energy 
and greenhouse gas (GHG)  reduction goal in 2015. 
The current goal’s intensity factor  
is based on hours worked, not 
revenue as previously used.  All consolidated operations  and joint ventures subscribing to 
Cummins’ Enterprise Environmental 
Management System are included.In 2016, the company’s GHG emissions decreased by 11,600 tons on an absolute basis and 2 percent adjusted for hours worked compared to the prior year. Cummins had a 
number of challenges in maintaining 
progress on the goal, including several new buildings and distributor locations included in scope as part 
of the Distribution Business’ North 
American consolidation that resulted in increased emissions. 
 
 The company continues to use  a facility investment plan approach, with a focus on test cell energy recovery and investments in  on-site renewable projects to offset 
electricity purchased from the grid. 
The company used tools and 
resources available from programs such as ISO 50001, the international 
energy management system, and the

 Workforce Cummins’ total waste disposed in 
2016 increased by 2,600 tons or  14 percent on an absolute basis  
and by 14 percent adjusted for  
hours worked. 
The fives sites previously achieving 
Zero Disposal status were recertified 
in 2016, and two new sites were 
validated, bringing the total number certified to seven. Cummins now has five Zero Disposal sites in Europe, one in North America and one in  
the Asia-Pacific region. 
Eighteen additional sites are 
approaching Zero Disposal, but  face challenges such as regulatory 
barriers in India and China, and the 
absence of vendors to help handle hard-to-recycle wastes.
Under Cummins’ definition of Zero 
Disposal, waste can only be burned 
as a last resort to create energy and 
then only if there is a net energy gain, creating more energy than is needed merely to sustain combustion.
 Cummins’ fuel economy teams 
throughout the world have implemented more than 200 projects since this goal was announced in 
2014.  The result is that Cummins 
has already achieved a 2.9 million metric ton annual run rate of CO
2 
reduction toward the company’s goal of a 3.5 million metric ton run rate. 
Global momentum with customers 
has yielded new initiatives, and more power systems and distribution business projects were launched in 
2016.  The average fuel economy  
 improvement of 6.7 percent across all projects is larger than the company’s original projections of 2 to 5 percent. 
Global fuel economy teams have 
been building functional capability  via fuel economy forums, training  and tools.
In meeting the company’s logistics 
goal, Cummins aims to create and maintain an efficient transportation network that reduces CO
2 emissions 
by improved transport planning to maximize loads, reduce miles when 
trucks are empty and minimize 
distance traveled.Cummins recorded a 3.7 percent reduction of CO
2 per kilogram of 
goods moved in 2016 towards  its goal of a 10 percent reduction  
by 2020. 
In the U.S., which accounts  
for approximately half of the company’s transportation  
spending, three of four operational 
areas are now managed through a single transportation system. Transportation leaders are analyzing their use of third-party logistics 
providers and are moving towards 
implementing a transportation  data analytics system in 2017.  
In sites outsides the U.S., analysis 
is being done to determine the 
best region or country specific transportation solution that will  enable Cummins to meet its goal. LOGISTICS

 Workforce PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP IS KEY  
TO SUSTAINABILITY AT CUMMINS
Cummins powers the interconnected world we live  
in today with an eye on what’s ahead tomorrow. 
From trucks delivering needed goods, to trains  
carrying passengers and freight, to generators powering hospitals, schools and data centers, 
Cummins works to make people’s lives better 
with the least environmental impact possible.
The company’s product stewardship goal means working 
with an environmental mindset about product design, use, remanufacture and end of life. Envolve Cummins (right) is 
the comprehensive lens through which the company views 
environmental sustainability. Cummins’ Environmental Sustainability Plan guides the company as it strives to  meet goals in three action areas:
 »Reducing Cummins’ carbon footprint 
 »Using fewer natural resources 
 »Partnering to solve complex problems.

 Workforce ENVIRONMENT // PRODUCT STEWARDSHIPUSING RESOURCES 
RESPONSIBLY
As the largest independent diesel 
engine manufacturer in the world, Cummins has the means and the 
commitment to reduce both the 
resources it uses to build products and the fuel burned to operate them.
Seventy percent of a product’s 
environmental footprint is determined 
during the earliest phases of the design process. The earlier the company can incorporate innovative design for the efficient use of fuel and 
raw materials, the greater its ability 
to reduce the environmental footprint of Cummins products both in their design and use. 
A Cummins team for material 
efficiency is working now on ways to make the company’s products more eco-efficient in the future.
Many of the concepts of the “circular 
economy” and its emphasis on re-use 
and recycling are not new, but this team is connecting with the  various functions in charge of materials work at Cummins to  elevate their importance. 
The goal is to use the right amount 
of material in everything the company makes to avoid unnecessary use of water and energy throughout a product’s lifecycle. That means using 
material optimization tools to ensure 
structural integrity with minimized material and specifying that raw material is finished as close as 
possible to the ending net shape  
of the component. 
Packaging leaders at Cummins 
are working to better understand what metrics and actions will drive 
consistent and environmentally sound 
packaging decisions. Their goals for sustainable packaging solutions are to reduce packaging waste and 
increase reusable solutions as well  
as the use of recyclable material.PRODUCTS IN  
USE EFFICIENCY 
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
from Cummins products in use are the company’s largest environmental 
impact and represent an estimated 
99 percent of Cummins’ GHG footprint due to fossil fuel use.  Cummins’ biggest opportunity to 
expand its product stewardship 
beyond the upfront design of its products is in working with customers to improve the efficiency of the company’s products in use.
One of Cummins goals (page 14) 
is to partner with its customers to 
improve the fuel efficiency of the company’s products in use, and by extension reduce carbon dioxide 
(CO
2). The company wants to cut 
CO2 emissions by nearly 16 million 
metric tons, saving customers up 
to $6.3 billion through greater fuel 
efficiency, by the end of 2020.Over the next five years, Cummins 
expects to work with 20 percent 
of its customer base, touching 
nearly 2 million engines as it tailors engine specifications to customer applications. The company wants 
to ensure customers have the latest 
tools to improve fuel efficiency.
Cummins has its own supercomputer, 
Clessie 2.0, which powers sophisticated design programs. It plays a key role in Cummins’ efforts to reduce the amount of material it uses in its products without affecting robustness.

 Workforce REMANUFACTURING
The need for remanufacturing will increase in a resource constrained world. 
Remanufacturing, which Cummins has done for 60 years, requires far less 
energy and natural resources to extend life than to build new products.
Remanufacturing maximizes benefits for customers and the environment. 
Cummins products are designed with this in mind, enabling them to have  a long, and increasingly fuel-efficient, life. 
Through the common application of salvage technology, component re-use 
guidelines and remanufacturing-specific policies and procedures, the company 
has become increasingly sophisticated in what it can remanufacture and for  how long it can extend a product’s life.
In many cases, remanufactured products today are “upcycled” to include 
design, emissions, fuel economy and quality upgrades.
REGULATIONS
Cummins strives to have robust certification and compliance processes, adhering to all emissions 
regulations worldwide, including 
prohibiting the use of defeat devices in all of the company’s products.
The company is transparent with all 
governing bodies in these processes, 
from disclosure of the design and operation of the emission control system, to test processes and results, and later to any necessary reporting and corrective action processes if required.
The company works collaboratively 
with emission regulators globally to ensure emission standards are clear, appropriately stringent, and 
enforceable, in an effort to ensure 
Cummins products deliver on the company’s commitments to its customers and the environment  in real world use every day.PRODUCT SAFETY 
Product safety is a top priority at Cummins. The company’s Product  Safety Policy states:
 »Cummins will design, manufacture, sell, distribute and service all products so that they are safe to use for the described and intended purpose. 
 »Cummins will provide its customers, its partners, the company’s employees and society with products that are safe to operate, maintain, adjust and repair when used as intended. 
 »Each Cummins employee will regard product safety as a top priority.
 »Each Cummins employee is responsible for applying the policy  
in his or her individual and collective 
work activity.
Each Cummins employee is expected  to adhere to the spirit as well as the  letter of the Product Safety Policy.THE NUMBERS BEHIND REMANUFACTURING

 Workforce Cummins engines are subject  
to extensive statutory and  regulatory requirements that directly 
or indirectly impose standards 
governing emissions and noise. The company has substantially increased its global environmental 
compliance presence and expertise 
to understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. 
The company’s ability to comply with 
these and future emission standards 
is an essential element in maintaining Cummins’ leadership position in regulated markets. The company  
has made, and will continue to  
make, significant capital and  research expenditures to comply  with these standards.
To see more, go to page 12 of 
Cummins 2016 Annual Report  
on the 10K Form. MATERIAL 
COMPLIANCE
Material compliance is key to 
Cummins' product stewardship.
The company maintains an internal 
corporate policy regarding the use of 
prohibited and restricted substances in its products. Cummins’ policies also take into account key global 
environmental regulations as well 
as very specific ones driven by the European Union such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH); 
Restriction of Hazardous Substances 
(RoHS), and End of Life Vehicle regulations for automotive products.  
REACH addresses the production 
and use of chemical substances 
and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment,   while RoHS restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic products.
Compliance with the company’s 
policies is designed into the materials 
Cummins uses and the company partners with its suppliers to ensure Cummins’ global compliance requirements are met. The company 
maintains global policies to carry 
out key processes such as the Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry process, consistent with 
the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) due diligence framework. LIFECYCLE ANALYSIS EXTENDS  
DEEPER INTO THE PRODUCT LINE
Cummins has continued its lifecycle analysis (LCA) work on several more 
products in the past year to estimate their total environmental impact. While reducing products in-use fuel consumption has the greatest 
potential impact, the analyses revealed other interesting findings. 
A team at Purdue University, for example, conducted an LCA on  
a Cummins turbocharger, looking into its energy and water usage,  along with its greenhouse gas emissions. The team concluded  
that use of recycled aluminum is key to reducing water and energy 
consumption from “cradle-to-gate” stage and identified which  manufacturing processes had the greatest impact.
In a project done by Montana State University students on a 455 kW 
Emergency Standby Power (ESP) diesel generator, the results revealed  
that, similar to on-highway engines, diesel generators consumed the  
most energy (greater 95 percent of the entire life cycle) during the use  phase, followed by materials, transportation, and then manufacturing. 
The company’s LCA work began in 2011 when Cummins partnered with 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to conduct an analysis of the 
company’s flagship product, the ISX 15L engine.  In addition to use-phase fuel consumption, metals and transportation combined accounted for about three-quarters of the embodied energy required to make an engine.
“Embodied energy” is a metric used to quantify all of the energy required 
to make a product and is a good proxy for environmental impacts broadly. 
Cummins estimates the LCAs conducted so far cover about 70 percent  
of the company’s revenues.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
Cummins improved the effectiveness of its facilities’ 
environmental management in 2016 by aligning strategies 
and processes among key groups within the company 
so they can act faster and take better advantage of more broadly available tools, training and best practice sharing.
For example, the successful 
Cummins Energy Champion  program, created in 2009, evolved 
in 2016 into the Environmental 
Champion program.
“We wanted sites to have a holistic 
view when reviewing facility projects, 
not just look through the lens of one 
media like energy,” said Nichole Morris, Environmental Manager and Cummins Water Program Leader.
“This way, you look at the benefits 
and the disadvantages of a project 
with the media of water, waste and energy in mind – as you can have good energy projects with positive  
or negative impacts,” she said.  
  “The common approach to tools  for all three media makes it easier  to teach, understand and support  
all the material.”
The Energy Champion program 
trained employees to look for examples where energy was wasted. 
In 2016, five sessions with a total 
of 166 attendees representing a good portion of the company’s footprint attended the much broader Environmental Champion training.  
The goal is to train champions to look 
for a host of environmental problems at 50 priority sites for the company comprising 90 percent of Cummins’ 
environmental footprint.
 ENERGY  
STRATEGY
Saving energy has both 
environmental and bottom-line benefits. The company estimates 
savings of nearly $50 million per  
year from its energy efficiency  efforts. Cummins’ strategy  focuses on four key areas:
 »Saving and conserving energy  by improving existing facilities.
 »Recovering energy from the  cells where engines are tested.
 »Building energy conservation  
into new construction.
 »Enhancing energy management.
Ten years into its energy efficiency 
journey, Cummins is still completing 
projects with very good returns.   
The average return on investment  is 32 percent. High efficiency  “smart” lighting and energy efficient windows, doors, walls and roofs  
 reduce heat gain or loss. Heating, 
cooling and recirculation systems offer opportunities for efficiency  
as do boilers and burners. 
Cummins has been working to 
recover energy generated by  engines and generators in its test 
cells by installing equipment that can 
capture that power for use by the plant or for sale to a local utility. 
Other components of the  
company’s energy strategy, include: 
ISO 50001 SITE 
IMPLEMENTATION
Cummins plans to implement the 
ISO 50001 international energy management system at 40 sites,  
or 90 percent of its carbon footprint 
by 2020. Here’s a look at the cumulative number facilities meeting those standards by year and the total 
percentage of the company’s carbon 
footprint they cover.  
 
 RENEWABLE STRATEGY
Cummins 2020 energy goal included 
a commitment to increase the amount of energy sourced from renewable power.  
The company is looking to expand 
onsite renewables where it makes sense and has committed up to  $10 million for these projects,

 Workforce ENVIRONMENT // FACILITY STRATEGYwhich could double Cummins’ 
current onsite capacity. 
The company has eleven solar 
installations, the two most significant 
being the 3.6 megawatt installation at the Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company Ltd. in China 
and the 2 megawatt installation 
at the Jamestown Engine Plant in Jamestown, New York. (U.S.A.).  
Cummins is also exploring ways 
to source even larger amounts of 
renewable power off-site – up to  
25 percent of the company’s total power needs. The company has joined a power purchase consortium 
in China to explore opportunities 
there and has researched opportunities in the U.S. A team is working with a community group in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.) on a 
community solar project. To guide 
the company’s decision making, Cummins created its own  Renewable Energy Principles:
 »Additional: Generation and purchases must have a net positive effect in the real world, increasing capacity of renewable power that did not previously exist. »Tangible:  Generation and 
purchases must create environmental benefit, for 
Cummins, the community or both.
 »Cost effective: Generation and 
purchase must be cost competitive with traditional energy sources  
over the long term.
 »Transparent:  Cummins will be 
very transparent in its renewable accounting and in describing  facility energy attributes.
 WATER  
STRATEGY
The company’s  
comprehensive water strategy addresses both direct water use and 
community engagement. Cummins 
has the opportunity through its more aggressive revised goal (page 14)  to 
amplify water efficiency efforts, which 
is important for several reasons: to 
mitigate business risk; to be a good global citizen and to reduce costs and compliance risk.
In its water management program, 
the company uses innovative assessment tools such as the 
Ceres Aqua Gauge (one of the first companies to use this framework), a global water risk screen and the 
“true cost of water” assessment that 
identifies water costs embedded in activities such as pumping, electricity and chemical use.
To achieve its 50 percent reduction, 
Cummins will expand the work it 
does with its sites in water program management, including intensive engagement with higher water use  
locations, water balance creation and 
sub-metering. The company also has plans for high impact and showcase projects, such as an alternative bio-tech system for producing high quality treated wastewater for process reuse at one of the 
company’s engine plants.
Cummins uses regenerative 
dynamometers (dynos) throughout the company to capture the mechanical energy of engines in test 
cells. The dynos also reduce cooling 
load, which allows cooling systems  to be smaller and use less water. 
Cummins’ strategy also identifies 
the critical role water plays in the 
company’s supply chain. Almost

 Workforce 90 percent of Cummins’ water 
footprint exists in the supply  chain, mostly associated with the 
extraction and production of metals. 
A risk analysis and mapping exercise 
of the company’s top 200 suppliers has been completed with Verisk 
Maplecroft to help Cummins better 
understand water risk in its supply chain. The company is beginning  to work with suppliers to help  them develop less water  
intensive techniques.WASTE  
STRATEGY
The company follows  
waste management hierarchy consistent with current industry 
standards: avoid the generation  
of waste, reuse, recycle, and  recover energy from waste.
Reducing packaging is one 
way Cummins tries to avoid the 
generation of waste. Reusing waste might involve reusing pallets or finding an alternative use without  any reprocessing. Recovery and reuse of coolants and solvents is 
another example. The recycling  
of metals, paper or wood also  reduce the amount of waste that  has to be disposed. 
The company’s ultimate goal is  
“Zero Disposal” (page 16) at  30 Cummins facilities. Cummins is also committed to avoiding the generation of hazardous waste  
and properly handling hazardous 
materials in the workplace.
The definition for what constitutes 
hazardous waste varies widely 
by country. Cummins follows all 
appropriate local and regional regulations. For U.S. sites that produce hazardous waste, Cummins has a formal vendor pre-qualification 
process to ensure the waste is 
handled properly.
 
    HSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
The company’s Enterprise 
Environmental Management System 
(EMS), created in 2003, plays a 
critical role in Cummins’ global environmental footprint reductions 
and other improvements. The 
company adopted a model that includes a common framework 
to ensure a similar look, feel and 
fundamental approach throughout the organization. 
The EMS has the flexibility to allow 
individual sites and businesses to address risks and opportunities 
most important to them. Cummins 
has integrated health and safety processes and procedures with 
the environment since 2007, in 
accordance with the international standard OHSAS 18001 
Occupational Health & Safety 
Management System, to create the company’s Enterprise Health, Safety 
and Management System (HSEMS).
The system has served as the 
framework for driving continual 
improvement and efforts beyond 
compliance at Cummins operations 
around the world. AUDITING 
AND DATA CERTIFICATION
Environmental goals are measured 
through a structured audit process. 
A third party auditor, Bureau Veritas 
Certification (BVC), certifies the HSEMS and the environmental 
metrics Cummins collects.
Since 2011, BVC has also audited 
Cummins’ environmental footprint 
and the company’s data collection 
and verification processes.  Cummins supplements the audit sampling 
conducted by BVC by conducting 
its own annual audits using internally trained HSE auditors.
Every site is audited on an annual 
basis. The company has developed an internal environmental auditor 
certification process, where 
employees complete a training course and then a series of  
audit levels. In 2016, more than  
40 people were trained and there is a pool of 111 Health, Safety and 
Environment leaders certified as  
HSE Lead Auditors.

 Workforce PARTNERING TO SOLVE 
COMPLEX PROBLEMS
Cummins’ partnerships and its policy  
advocacy efforts play key roles in the company’s environmental strategy and performance.
They help Cummins meet product 
emission goals, use energy more efficiently and bring environmental 
solutions to the marketplace.
Four of the company’s  
10 environmental sustainability principles focus on partnerships  
with legislative and regulatory  
entities to develop sound public policy that reduces Cummins’  impact on the environment.  They are:
 »Help develop  responsible regulations.
 »Promote technology development.
 »Advocate for incentives  
to accelerate progress.  »Support a balanced  
global approach.
Cummins has a long history of 
demonstrating its leadership in 
developing the technologies needed to meet tough emissions standards and improve fuel efficiency that are 
the hallmarks of products across  
the globe. 
For example, Cummins certified early 
to meet U.S. Phase 1 fuel efficiency standards in 2013 and 2016 and 
was part of a stakeholder group 
participating in a multi-year effort  to advocate for the rule. 
In August 2016, Cummins expressed 
its readiness to provide fuel savings 
and environmental benefits as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) finalized the second phase 
of their national fuel efficiency and 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission regulations for medium- and  heavy-duty commercial vehicles. 
These regulations cover Cummins’ 
on-highway engines from 200 to more than 600 horsepower output. 
The agencies released a final rule that 
sets new standards for engines, on-
highway tractors, vocational vehicles, 
trailers and heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans. The Phase 2 standards, intended to drive further reductions 
in fuel consumption and greenhouse 
gas emissions, are an important step  
toward achieving national climate and  
 PARTNERING FOR CLEANER AIR,  
ENVIRONMENTAL RESILIENCY
Cummins is a corporate partner with Indiana 
University (IU) in its Prepared for Environmental 
Change initiative, the second project funded 
through IU’s Grand Challenges Program,  which launched in 2015.
IU will invest $55 million to help Indiana, 
Cummins' headquarters state in the U.S.,  
develop actionable solutions that prepare 
businesses, communities and individuals  
for the effects of ongoing environmental change. The initiative will create  
an Environmental Resilience Institute to better predict the impact of these  
threats and facilitate collaboration between IU's faculty and Indiana  
residents, businesses, nonprofits and the public sector. 
Cummins is also working to reduce diesel black carbon emissions in  
partnership with the Heavy-Duty Diesel Vehicles and Engines Initiative (HDDI)  
of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, co-led by the governments of  Canada, the United States and Switzerland alongside the International  
Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) and UN (United Nations) Environment.
Diesel engines today are responsible for about 19 percent of global black 
carbon emissions, a short-lived climate pollutant that contributes to rapid  
near-term climate change. The Soot-Free Urban Bus Fleets Project of the  
HDDI aims to secure commitments from 20 major cities around the world to shift all future bus procurement to soot-free engines that meet Euro VI 
emissions standards as a minimum.
Cummins is working in partnership with the ICCT and its implementing  
partners to make available Cummins Euro VI technology to all OEM  
partners in target cities by 2018.

In 2016, Cummins 
introduced a vision statement for new  product design:
Powering the future 
through product 
innovation that makes 
people’s lives better and reduces our environmental footprint. PARTNERING FOR A 
GLIMPSE OF WHAT 
THE FUTURE HOLDSThe road to a low carbon future  
is littered with questions.
Will there be major shifts in the transportation used to move 
people and freight? What about autonomous vehicles? How 
about fuel cells? Will there be more regulations to reduce air 
pollution and lower greenhouse gases?
These are not only interesting 
questions, they are critical to Cummins’ long-term success  
and sustainability.
Two notable guests, distinguished 
scholars Dan Sperling and Joan Ogden from the Institute for 
Transportation Studies at the 
University of California at Davis,  met Cummins leaders and employees in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.) to discuss the future of  
low carbon transportation.
“In many ways we are seeing more 
change now and in the next few years than we’ve seen perhaps  
even since the Model T,” Sperling  
told employees.Consider one example of a technological transformation that Professors Sperling and Ogden laid 
out in regards to infrastructure: as 
use of alternative fuels expand and diversify, the placement of fueling or charging stations will be a significant 
challenge to support the range of 
power sources represented on any given stretch of highway.
As GPS technology improves, 
however, the world may need fewer 
overall stations as people are better 
able to anticipate their fueling needs and plan their stops. 
In preparation for this transformation 
and many other uncertainties, 
Cummins leaders have been conducting scenario planning over the past year, meeting with experts to look more than 30 years into the future to better understand the range of global regulatory, technological and societal factors that could present 
risks as well as opportunities.
The goal of this effort is to ensure 
that Cummins’ business planning and investments are informed and contemplate all major scenarios  
that could impact the business  
as the future unfolds. 
Put simply, scenario planning is not  
a prediction of the future, but a tool  
to establish an internally consistent 
view of what may lie ahead to  inform planning. 
“Humans are incredibly creative  
and inventive, but only when we 
focus on particular challenges –  
our resources, our intellectual  abilities, our R&D and our policies,” Sperling said. “As we focus more 
on efficiency, lowering pollution 
and sustainability, we will see an accelerating rate of change in  our technologies and our transportation systems.” 
University of California at Davis Distinguished Professor Dan Sperling discusses the  
future of low carbon transportation with top Cummins leaders. Sperling leads the

In 2016, Cummins employees worked on community projects across the globe. For a third 
consecutive year, participation in 
the company’s Every Employee Every Community (EEEC) program exceeded the company’s goal of  
70 percent. In 2016, more than 
50,000 employees, joint venture  employees and contractors  honored the company’s  Corporate Responsibility  
commitment by engaging in 
community improvement efforts.
Although the EEEC program  
provides employees at least four 
hours of work time annually to  
devote to community improvement projects, many invest much more than that with their supervisor’s approval. Employees reported 
spending more than 400,000 hours 
on community initiatives in 2016.Cummins also operates several foundations to support its corporate responsibility efforts. In 2016, the 
company gave $13.9 million through 
grants and other strategic community investments to support employee led projects in more than 25 countries, 
including four that received support

Most community initiatives are 
organized by the company’s Community Involvement Teams (CITs).  
These teams are typically site-based 
and structured around Cummins’ three corporate responsibility  focus areas.
Once again in 2016, many CITs 
competed in the company’s Environmental Challenge. Now in its eighth year, the Challenge is a competition to produce the most  
impactful service projects dealing 
with the environment. Eighty-seven projects, many building on the success of previous years, were completed in 2016, engaging  17,400 employees from 23 countries.
Although each Environmental 
Challenge project had specific strengths, 19 were determined to be the most impactful, and were declared global Challenge winners. 
Each global winner will receive 
$10,000 to donate to a community partner of its choice. Five additional projects were awarded $5,000 each, 
also to be donated to a community 
partner. In the past, prize money  has been used to scale projects  and further increase impact.
The company’s TEC: Technical 
Education for Communities program 
continued to grow and thrive in 2016. TEC works with schools and other industry partners to teach students 
the technical and life skills needed  
for a productive career.
 
 In 2016, Komatsu Inc., one of the world’s largest equipment manufacturers, agreed to partner  with Cummins in several TEC 
schools. The partnership is building 
on the already strong business relationship between Cummins  and Komatsu. 
TEC now operates in 18 locations 
around the world with more than  
20 corporate partners.
KEEPING OUR 
COMMITMENT STRONG
In 2017, Cummins will build on  
the success of its community programs, always keeping in  
mind the fundamental purpose  
of corporate responsibility.
“What’s most important is how 
steadfast and committed we are 
as a company to the people of 
our communities,” Chandler said. “Community involvement is as ingrained in the culture and heart  of Cummins as the color red.”

As a Human Resources Manager in Cummins’ Distribution 
Business in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Natalia Giqueaux 
knows how important proper job training can be for 
succeeding in a career. So when she and her colleagues saw people in their community struggling to get jobs,  
they put their skills to work to make a difference.  The Cummins employees partnered 
with the nonprofit TECHO Argentina to help unemployed community 
members receive job training 
and other skills. With a $20,000 Community Development Grant (CDG) from the Cummins Foundation, 
the partnership reached some  
250 people with classes in areas such as electricity, plumbing and more. Cummins employees participated in mock interviews and 
other activities to help participants 
prepare for the job market.
“I love encouraging young people to 
pursue their dreams, whatever those 
may be, and showing them how we 
achieved ours," Giqueaux said.The CDG program funded  projects like Giqueaux’s in more  than 25 countries around the world 
in 2016, including four that received 
support for the first time. Grant requests are made by Cummins employees on behalf of a community partner, providing opportunities for 
employees to engage in a more 
meaningful way.
All CDG projects must be located 
in communities where Cummins 
employees live or work. The company 
believes strongly that the grants should support employee efforts  to build stronger communities. 
In 2016, Cummins gave  
$13.9 million through CDGs 
and other strategic community investments to support employee- led projects such as refugee language 
immersion, educational greenhouses, 
revitalizing food pantries, cleanup  of polluted rivers, leadership training for children with disabilities and  much more.
 
  The projects aligned both with the company’s global priority areas of education, environment and social 
justice/equality of opportunity, as well 
as defined regional or site strategies for corporate responsibility. 
Cummins’ leaders frequently play 
an important role in CDG projects, 
working with employees to set 
priorities and address obstacles.  For example, Pedro Zermeno, General Manager in the Latin  
America Distribution Business,  
was instrumental in the Cummins-TECHO project.
Giqueaux said she felt tremendous 
satisfaction in addressing a 
community need in such a  
meaningful way.
“TECHO provides educational 
assistance, psychological support 
and job training programs, like our 
Cummins job program,” she said. “Partnering with them meant we could help families get a home or help community members gain 
access to water or other vital 
community services. That is  very rewarding to me.”

 Workforce HEALTH & SAFETY  
TO FOCUS ON ‘FANTASTIC  
FOUR’ IN 2017
Cummins saw improvements in several key safety 
performance metrics in 2016, including a 20 percent increase in training hours for employees and an improving trend in both Major Injuries and  Restricted Work Day cases.
The company’s Distribution Business, 
meanwhile, achieved significant improvements in several areas 
including 20 fewer recordable injuries 
in 2016 compared to 2015, resulting in a record low Incidence Rate for that business segment.
Cummins sites also completed 
a record number of ergonomic assessments and the company’s   Health & Safety function launched a Global Action Plan program to deploy across the company what it learned 
from its major injury investigations to 
prevent recurrences. Health & Safety also initiated multiple projects in 2016 to leverage leading indicators 
for performance measurement and 
predictive analytics. 
 
 While Cummins made important strides in strategic as well as tactical areas of health and safety, the 
company did miss some aggressive 
goals in 2016 and saw a 3.5 percent increase in total recordable injuries globally. Cummins leadership has 
demanded that targets for 2017 
remain aggressive, demonstrating their commitment to protecting the company’s most important asset,  its employees. SAFETY  
PERFORMANCE  INDICATORS
Here’s a look at key trends in health  
and safety at Cummins since 2006.

FOCUS AREAS
Health & Safety leaders believe 
focusing on the “Fantastic Four,” a group of key health and safety 
initiatives it has identified, will help the 
company improve on its key metrics in 2017. The focus areas are:
 »Strengthening the health  
and safety culture
 »Major injury reduction »Incident investigation and  
root cause analysis
 »Ergonomic injury prevention
The Health & Safety function also 
has identified Health, Safety and 
Environmental Talent Management as a key strategic focus for 2017. This cross-functional led initiative is designed to attract, develop and 
retain high performing employees to 
meet the function’s strategic goals and objectives.“The Fantastic Four initiatives have been identified as having the most significant impact on our combined 
health and safety performance,”  
said Michelle Garner-Janna, Executive Director of Corporate Health and Safety. “Building and 
deploying robust processes and 
toolkits for these areas, and ensuring sustainable systems, allows for both short and long term risk reduction and continued improvement.”
HIGHLIGHTS
Health and Safety highlights  for 2016 included:
 »The Live It. Lead It. program 
was expanded to include a version not just for leaders but for all employees known as Passport to Safety. This training continues 
to bolster Cummins’ culture of 
interdependence in health and safety. More than 1.5 million hours were dedicated to safety training  in 2016 compared to just  
under 1.3 million in 2015. »Restricted Work Day cases  fell dramatically in 2016,  
down 26 percent compared  to the year before. Restricted  Work Days also fell but not as dramatically, dropping 8 percent.
 »A renewed focus on major injury reduction was implemented, including the creation of a cross-functional team to review incidents, 
identify key learnings and create 
action plans to prevent future major injuries. This led to the launch of a preventive program known as “Global Action Plans” to verify that 
appropriate preventive actions are 
deployed across the company.
 »The development and implementation of an investigation 
and root cause analysis program 
to help Health & Safety personnel systematically and thoroughly investigate incidents. By identifying the true root causes of an 
incident – for example, employee 
behaviors, uneven work surfaces, or ergonomic risks – Cummins  can deploy adequate  
mitigation measures and  
prevent future incidents.Severity Case Rate Incidence Rate Major Injury Rate Ergo Incidence Rate

 Workforce JAMESTOWN WINS ANOTHER ERGO CUP
A team from Cummins’ Jamestown Engine Plant in Jamestown, 
New York (U.S.A.) won the 5th-annual Cummins Ergo Cup award for its innovative solution to an ergonomic challenge  that all engine builders face: drive belt installation. 
The solution was designed and built entirely in house using 
pneumatics, 3D printing, and custom machined components to completely eliminate the physical force involved with installation of 
the drive belt. This project contributed to $3.8 million in productivity 
savings the company has recorded from Ergo Cup improvement projects over the past three years. 
The winning team consisted of Greg Scott, Kendrick Knight, Nick 
Luther, Rory Hollabaugh, and Seth Primack. Knight is now a two-time 
winner of the cup, having won in 2014 for the Knight Knuckle, a tool to reduce the “kick” of torque that accompanies the use of high-torque tools to tighten screws and bolts. »The company continued its  focus on preventing ergonomic injuries, with more than  
4,000 job assessments logged 
in The HumanTech System – Cummins’ ergonomic software. Significant focus has been  
placed on reducing moderate  
and high risks in the future.
 »The company’s Distribution Business, which sells and  services the full range of  
Cummins products, achieved  
a major turn-around in its safety metrics in 2016. Distribution implemented a campaign to 
improve its safety culture and  
saw the segment’s Incidence  Rate, which was four to five times other areas of Cummins, fall roughly four-fold from its peak. AREAS FOR 
IMPROVEMENT
In 2016, Cummins Major Injury Rate 
showed a 9 percent improvement as compared to 2015, but was still over 
the company’s goal. 
The Severity Case Rate, the number 
of injuries and illnesses resulting in lost work days per 100 employees, 
missed its target as well. The rate 
was 0.225 in 2016 compared to 0.195 the previous year.
In 2016, Health and Safety  
leaders also identified opportunities 
for improving the function’s global 
reporting process. Data from 2015 and 2016 were revised to reflect  this opportunity.  
And early in 2016, a workplace 
violence event resulted in the death of an employee. The company has taken several steps in the wake of this incident including additional 
employee training led by the 
company’s security function.LOOKING AHEAD
In 2017, culture will continue to be key as the company builds on existing programs to invigorate 
employees’ dedication to health  
and safety.
“What matters most for Cummins to 
achieve an injury free workplace is to 
continue to foster a culture of caring 
along with a spirit of interdependence in which every employee looks out not only for their own safety, but for the safety of their co-workers, family, 
friends and communities as well,” 
Garner-Janna said.
“Our expectations are high for 
health and safety, our leadership is 
fully committed to deliver and more 
importantly our employees and their families fully deserve it,” she added.

Cummins in 2016 
conducted a Safety Pledge Card campaign – the largest project of its kind to date 
at the company. Translated 
into 26 languages and shipped to more than 200 global sites, the card was designed to foster conversations about safety between site leaders, 
managers and employees.AN UNWAVERING 
COMMITMENT TO 
DIVERSITY AND 
INCLUSION
While diversity and inclusion continue to make headlines 
around the world, Cummins took multiple steps in 2016 to 
make sure its employees everywhere feel respected and 
valued. This work was reflected in company-wide initiatives, a new award and leadership messages. 
“When we make diversity and inclusion a priority, the company benefits,” said 
Executive Director – Global Diversity and Right Environment Kelley Creveling. “Our employees bring unique experiences, thoughts and perspectives  
from all over the world. It’s when we have those differences of thought,  
working together, that we’re most creative.”
COMMITTING TO 
GENDER EQUALITY
In 2016, Cummins joined thousands 
of global companies who have signed the U.N. Women’s Empowerment 
Principles. The seven principles 
emphasize the business case for promoting gender equality and empowering women.  The company is committed to promoting gender equality in the workplace, marketplace and in the 
communities where it does business. 
Led by the southern Indiana Women’s 
Affinity Group, Cummins also launched the “HeForShe” campaign 
in partnership with U.N. Women in 
early 2017. HeForShe sees gender   equality as a human rights issue and stresses the importance of men’s 
involvement in working toward a 
gender-balanced world. The group generated interest in the initiative  at Cummins sites across the globe, which developed their own events  to support the program.
Cummins celebrated men and 
women champions for gender equality through a series of stories running on the company’s internal 
website that profiled employees who 
advocate for others. The champions described their motivation to be part of HeForShe and their advice for empowering women. CELEBRATING 
DIVERSITY
For the first time in 2016,  
Cummins celebrated diversity with the Chairman’s Diversity Award.  
The award was created as an 
opportunity to recognize employees for their work in fostering diversity and inclusion. The inaugural award 
winner was a team from India chosen 
for its dedication to promoting a gender-balanced workplace. 
The team created initiatives  
focused on recruiting, developing  
and advancing women at the 
company. It set out with the goal of attracting more women interns in hopes of increasing the gender diversity in the pool of candidates  to convert to full-time employees.  The team also analyzed exit data  
and noticed that a lot of women  
were leaving the workforce to  pursue higher education. 
In order to increase the likelihood 
these women would return to 
Cummins after their studies, the team established a sabbatical policy allowing for a two-year break in employment to pursue higher 
education. During the sabbatical, 
Alexis M. Herman, Lead Director of the Cummins Board of Directors, talks about diversity 
and breaking down barriers in a 2016 speech to company employees in Columbus, Indiana (USA). Herman was the first African American to lead the U.S. Department of Labor. THE REST OF

LEADING BY 
EXAMPLE
Jennifer Rumsey, Vice President – 
Chief Technical Officer, and Tracy Embree, President – Components 
Business, shared their diversity 
journeys with employees and challenged them to work toward more inclusive environments in Cummins workplaces and communities. Their stories were part of a series on the company’s internal website in which 
leaders shared their thoughts on 
diversity and inclusion with employees. 
Rumsey’s story focused on 
unconscious biases and the importance of addressing biases 
before they become a problem 
and cloud decision making and judgment. She shared a story when unconscious bias affected someone’s 
behavior toward her and called upon 
employees to acknowledge their own biases and remove barriers that stand in the way of collaboration, innovation, creativity and success.
Embree addressed invisible diversity –  
how even unseen facets of diversity 
such as personality and values need to be embraced and celebrated if company employees want to work together and deliver for customers. 
She shared personal examples of the 
ways invisible diversity plays a large part in her team dynamic and how taking into consideration others’ work 
styles and preferences has helped 
her become a better leader.
MAINTAINING OUR CODE
A key part of creating the right environment for success is the ability to investigate complaints made about employees’  
treatment of each other. Cummins has Master Investigators around the world to investigate reported violations of the  
company’s Code of Business Conduct. Here are some key indicators of that work.SPENDING ON  
DIVERSE SUPPLIERS
2016 was a banner year for Cummins’ diversity procurement  
team. The company was recognized by the National Business Inclusion  Consortium in its inaugural 2016 NBIC Best-of-the Best Top 30 Corporations for Inclusion. The company was inducted into the Billion Dollar Roundtable, a prestigious advocate for best practices in corporate supplier diversity. Members must have exceeded $1 billion in annual spending with diverse suppliers. Finally, Cummins was named Corporation of the Year in the Top Performers Category, its first national award from  the National Minority Supplier Development Council.

BE READY WHEN  
MARKETS RETURN
Cummins continued to weather challenging markets by 
carefully managing costs to preserve profitability and 
provide strong returns to shareholders in 2016.
“We made significant progress in a 
number of our key initiatives in 2016, including executing our restructuring 
actions, completing the acquisition 
of our distributors in North America and continuing to invest in new products, all of which help position 
the company for profitable growth 
when markets improve,” said  Tom Linebarger, Chairman and CEO. 
Revenues for 2016 were $17.5 billion, 
an 8 percent decline from the year 
before, with net income attributable 
to Cummins of $1.39 billion  ($8.23 per diluted share). In 2015,  the company recorded $19.1 billion  
in revenues and a net income of  
$1.4 billion ($7.84 per diluted share). Earnings Before Interest and  Taxes (EBIT), meanwhile, were  $2.0 billion in 2016 or 11.4 percent 
of sales, compared to $2.1 billion or 
10.9 percent of sales a year earlier.  
Revenues in North America 
decreased 12 percent primarily 
because of reduced demand in  
the on-highway and industrial oil  and gas and construction markets.  
International sales decreased 
2 percent mainly due to foreign 
currency movements. Excluding 
the impact of those movements, international revenues rose 2 percent with growth in China and India offset 
by weaker demand in Latin America, 
the Middle East and Africa.

You can find extensive 
financial information about Cummins by looking at the company’s 
Annual Report on 
the 10K Form on the company’s Investor Relations website.Approximately 46 percent of the 
company’s net sales for 2016  were attributable to customers 
outside the U.S. compared to  
44 percent in 2015.
Cummins returned 75 percent of its 
Operating Cash Flow to shareholders 
in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In December of 2016, 
the Board of Directors authorized  the company to repurchase up  
to $1 billion in shares of common 
stock upon completion of its 2015  $1 billion share repurchase program.
Cummins took a number of steps 
during the year to position itself for growth when market conditions 
improve. Chief among them, the company reorganized its business 
to combine the Power Generation 
segment and the high horsepower engine business to create the new Power Systems segment. Cummins’ 
reportable operating segments 
now consist of Engine, Distribution, Components and Power Systems.
The change is designed to streamline 
the business and technical processes 
to accelerate innovation, grow  
market share and more efficiently manage Cummins’ supply chain  and manufacturing operations.
During 2016, the company also paid 
$109 million to acquire the remaining interest in its last two partially owned North American distributors.  In 2013, the company announced  its intention to acquire the equity it 
did not already own in the company’s 
partially owned U.S. and Canadian distributors. The move is part of Cummins’ effort to more closely 
partner with its customers to help 
them succeed.
The company invested $636 million 
into Research and Development in 2016, bringing its total investment  
in R&D since 2014 to more than  
$2 billion to improve core products such as diesel engines, develop  new features such as remote 
monitoring systems that improve 
customer uptime, and explore alternative solutions for improving powertrain performance. 
With all of its 2017 on-highway 
engines certified by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency  and the California Air Resources Board, fewer single source  
suppliers in its supply chain, and 
promising new products like the  X15 engine series, Cummins is poised for better times ahead.

CUMMINS IS FUELED  
BY FORWARD THINKING
Cummins is preparing for a 
future beyond diesel engines with technologies such as electrified powertrains, alternative fuels  and telematic systems.  
“The work of the entire Cummins technical organization over the next 15 years 
will be defined by leading the company through this next technology change, which in many markets will include a shift away from diesel,” said Jennifer 
Rumsey, Cummins Vice President and Chief Technical Officer. 
Even diesel engines today are moving in exciting new directions,  
combining with new technologies to better serve customers.   
Rumsey and other Cummins leaders, for example, attended IAA  
in September 2016, the major truck and bus trade show held every  
two years in Germany. At the show, exhibit hall after exhibit hall was  filled Cummins customers and competitors, both major players in the  industry and others that are emerging. Only about 25 “loose” diesel  engines – engines that were not integrated in a chassis – were on display 
throughout the entire show. In 2014, there were twice that number. At the Cummins’ Materials Science 
Laboratory in the Cummins Technical 
Center in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A), 
employees use sophisticated tools  
to work in the realm of atoms. 7 WAYS CUMMINS

INTRODUCTION
ENVIRONMENT

In April of 2016,  
Cummins was awarded  a $4.5 million grant from  the U.S. Department of 
Energy to develop a Class 
6 commercial plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that can reduce fuel consumption by at least 50 percent  over conventional  Class 6 vehicles.ECONOMIC
SOCIALMany of the show’s headlines 
focused on electrified powertrains with a huge emphasis on hybrid and 
electric concept vehicles and models 
in production. It can be difficult to distinguish the hyperbole from the reality, but it was clear the world is 
changing. Cummins is ready.
Cummins has a long history, 
beginning in the early 1990s, with hybrid powertrains and the company continues to innovate in this area. For 
example, a Cummins team is working 
on a pioneering project in Quebec, Canada, that is delivering range extender electric powertrains for the 
local bus authority. This project is part of Cummins’ work to develop 
a portfolio of hybrid and electric solutions for customers around  
the world.
Exploring these new technologies 
while also creating the best diesel products in the marketplace is the 
responsibility of Rumsey and the 
technical organization. The shift to something new won’t happen overnight. Diesel is expected to continue dominating most  
markets in the coming years.
Because they offer an  
unmatched combination of  efficiency, performance, power 
density, durability and reliability – 
coupled with near zero emissions thanks to recent innovations –  diesel engines will likely be the technology of choice to power  
the majority of commercial trucks  
and buses well into the future.Over the next several years, major markets around the world such as China, India, Mexico and Brazil 
will advance to Euro 6 emission 
standards. As the leading diesel engine provider in the world, Cummins has a full range of  products across all applications to 
meet these standards and provide 
customers with leading performance and quality at affordable costs.In addition to investing in the development of new power sources, Cummins has global teams finding 
solutions that go beyond the physical 
product, such as data-enabled technologies that make it possible  to update calibrations over-the-air  
for a single engine or an entire fleet.  
The company is looking both 
at what’s ahead tomorrow and for years to come. It's part of the company’s commitment to 
powering the future through product 
innovation that makes people's lives better and reduces the company's environmental footprint.  
“Cummins will be ready to provide 
leading products and support across the entire globe because we look ahead, anticipate customers’ needs, and ensure that our products are 
tested and ready for new regulations 
before our customers need them,” said Cummins Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger. 
2013PATENTS
It can take three-to-four years 
to obtain a patent in the United States and longer outside the U.S., so it’s hard to make year 
to year comparisons. But it’s

CUMMINS CONNECTED SOLUTIONS MISSION
Time is money for Cummins customers whether they  
are hauling goods down a highway, moving material in a 
mine or using our products in any number of other ways. 
Keeping them on the job and out of the repair shop is a  key focus for Cummins and critical to its sustainability.
The company’s Connected Solutions 
business is an important interface  with customers and service providers, 
alike. It offers a variety of tools  
ranging from sophisticated software and telematics, which allows the  remote transfer of information, to 
providing solutions over the phone  
to solve customer problems. 
“Making service provider lives 
easier makes customer lives better,” said Lori Cobb, Vice President of 
Cummins Connected Solutions. 
“Connected Solutions is dedicated  to using our vast product knowledge to innovate new solutions for 
customer success.”
 MAKING  
CONNECTIONS
A key focus in 2016 was preparation 
for the early 2017 release of the Connected Software Update,  
the first system that updates  
engine calibrations on the road through a fleet’s existing telematics. With this technology, the customer’s 
engine software stays up-to-date  
with minimal time and effort. Cummins also prepared for its  launch of Connected Advisor,  which interprets and prioritizes  
engine fault codes – signals that  
the engine may have a problem. 
For each actionable fault code, 
Connected Advisor reports  provide valuable information with an estimated timeframe so customers can resolve potential equipment issues before they happen.
CUSTOMER AND 
SERVICE SUPPORT
In June 2016, Cummins released an 
integrated service experience with an application to guide repair technicians 
through a service event in real time. 
The application integrates Cummins many individual systems that provide service tool capabilities such as 
diagnostics, procedures, diagrams, 
etc., effectively providing technicians with access to all repair related needs in one place.
This system will be enhanced over 
time to include all aspects of the 
service event, such as creating repair plans, ordering parts, filing warranty claims, and more. This new service 
provider experience will be available 
through the mobile app Cummins Guidanz, which was released in early 2017. Guidanz enables both service providers and customers to quickly assess engine problems so repairs 
can be completed faster.ECONOMIC // CUSTOMERS
Cummins spent much of 2016  
preparing for the launch of its  Guidanz mobile app in early 2017.  The app allows both service providers and customers to quickly get information about potential engine problems so  they can get back to work faster.

CUSTOMERSGovernanceCUMMINS MAKES  
ETHICS A PRIORITY
The Cummins Ethics and Compliance function built on  
its solid foundation in 2016 by updating the company’s 
Code of Business Conduct, creating a new policy  for third parties doing business on Cummins’ behalf  and upgrading training initiatives around the world. 
“We continue to work 
on instilling a culture of 
ethics and compliance 
in all of our regions,” 
said Mark J. Sifferlen, 
Vice President – Ethics 
and Compliance and 
Corporate Secretary. 
“No company can truly 
be sustainable until this 
culture is embraced 
by every one of its employees and anyone 
conducting business  
on its behalf.”  The Cummins Code of Business 
Conduct is the backbone of company's commitment to ethical 
behavior. It guides all employees in 
the decisions they make and the actions they take. The code’s  10 principles remain unchanged  
but language in the document  
was updated to keep it relevant.  
Nearly half of Cummins’ employees 
have been at the company less than five years. Ethics and Compliance 
updates the document about every 
two to three years to ensure that the examples it includes to help employees are meaningful.   
Ethics and Compliance has  
also been focused on the risk  
posed to Cummins by third parties  doing business on the company’s behalf, especially in areas such  
as bribery and conflicts of  
interest. About 90 percent of the enforcement actions brought by  the U.S. government for alleged bribery involve third parties.   CUMMINS CODE OF  
BUSINESS CONDUCT
Cummins Code of Business Conduct is built around 10 Ethical Principles  
to help make Cummins a sustainable company and a great place to work:
01 WE WILL FOLLOW the law everywhere.
02 WE WILL EMBRACE diverse perspectives  
and backgrounds and treat all people  
with dignity and respect.
03 WE WILL COMPETE fairly and honestly.
04 WE WILL AVOID conflicts of interest.
05 WE WILL DEMAND that everything we  do leads to a cleaner, healthier and  
safer environment.
06 WE WILL PROTECT our technology, our  information and our intellectual property.
07 WE WILL DEMAND that our financial records  
are accurate and that our reporting  
processes are clear and understandable.
08 WE WILL STRIVE to improve our communities.
09 WE WILL COMMUNICATE honestly and with integrity.
10 WE WILL CREATE a culture where all employees  take responsibility for ethical behavior.

MASTER INVESTIGATORS  
Cummins has a team of

THE STORY
A Cummins employee is taking  
a lead in the fight against corruption  and human trafficking.
Cummins adopted a Sales Agents 
and Third Party Intermediaries  Policy in 2016. This internal policy 
provides guidance on how to 
appropriately engage a sales agent and includes the company’s ethical and legal requirements for third  
party intermediaries.  
Training for employees, independent 
distributors and third parties also remains a priority for Ethics and Compliance. The majority of the 
company’s training in areas like 
fair competition and anti-bribery is conducted online. A key input from regional leaders was the need to 
conduct more face-to-face training on 
both the Cummins Code of Business Conduct and major risk areas.  
Ethics and Compliance has been 
focused on increasing face-to-  
face training in high risk countries. 
In 2016, more than 1,400 people attended face-to-face training sessions across Cummins.  Ethics and Compliance has also encouraged leaders from around the world to communicate with 
their employees about ethics and 
compliance, frequently in their employees’ native languages.  
“We worked with our business 
leaders in Brazil, Mexico, Russia, 
Singapore and Africa to deliver written reminders to employees in those regions about the importance of ethics and compliance,” Sifferlen 
said. “We want this message to 
be delivered by multiple people, in multiple ways. It’s just that important.”  
CUMMINS 
SUPPLIER  CODE OF  CONDUCT
The Supplier Code of Conduct  
helps the company ensure that it’s  
doing business with other companies 
around the world sharing Cummins’ 
values for sustainable practices.  The Supplier Code of Conduct  is built around seven principles:
01 Suppliers must follow the law.
02 Suppliers must treat all people  
with dignity and respect.
03 Suppliers must do business  fairly and honestly and avoid 
conflicts of interest.
04 Suppliers must protect  
the environment.
05 Suppliers must provide  a safe and healthy  
working environment.
06 Suppliers must protect Cummins technology, 
information and  
intellectual property.
07 Suppliers must assist  
Cummins in enforcing  
the code.COMPLIANCE TRAINING
Thousands of employees receive ethics and compliance training  
every year at Cummins. These figures are accumulated enrollments  
of active employees since 2005, when the oldest courses were  
first offered. The completion rates reflect the number of  completions by the end of the first quarter of 2017.

PROXY IMPROVEMENTS 
Cummins implemented  
several improvements to its 2017 Proxy Statement, making the document more user friendly for its Annual  
Meeting on May 9, 2017. 
The document now includes  
a highlights box (page 2), 
briefly explaining everything from board member accountability to clawback  and anti-hedging policies. There’s an expanded statement on diversity  
(page 7) and you can learn 
more about the current  board’s qualifications and experience as well as a summary of the unique contributions each member makes (starting on page 10). ECONOMIC // GOVERNANCE // BOARD OF DIRECTORSt58

 Workforce NEW COUNCIL DRIVES CULTURE  
OF RISK MANAGEMENT 
Cummins continued a multi-year transformation of its 
risk management function in 2016, establishing an Enterprise Risk Council made up of the company’s  top leaders who will manage oversight of risk and provide direction on risk-related matters.
The new council is part of a 
framework designed to drive a culture of continuous improvement in risk 
management at Cummins, where 
risk is recognized and responded to appropriately. As part of the transformation, each company leader 
has taken ownership of an individual 
risk that could have potential impact on the company’s growth plans or long term sustainability. 
Bindu Yadlapalli, Director – Risk 
Management, said the new council 
should help the company identify risks, determine those that present the greatest potential impact, and develop plans to deal with  them. Not all risks are bad.  Some offer opportunity.
While establishment of the  
council was a major initiative in 2016, it was far from the only thing Enterprise Risk Management tackled.
The function continued to help  
sites within Cummins develop Business Continuity Plans, outlining how they would operate when  facing an emergency. More than  
600 locations now have plans and 
many conducted table-top exercises to test their effectiveness.The Enterprise Risk Management team also helped oversee more involved stress tests administered 
by a third party at some of the 
company’s 74 sites deemed most critical to Cummins’ operations.
Each of the 74 sites is expected  
to go through a stress test at least 
once every four years. Enterprise  Risk Management works with  Risk Insurance and Global  Integrated Services (formerly  
Global Security) on the tests. SECURITY  
PART OF NEW DEPARTMENT
Cummins global security 
function in 2016 was combined with hospitality  
and aviation services in a 
move designed to increase  the effectiveness of all  three groups.
Global Integrated Services 
will still handle operations designed to keep employees safe and secure through programs such as the  
Crisis Action Management 
Program and the Cummins Response Center.
The aviation function  
operates shuttle flights  
to various locations in the U.S. and Mexico. Hospitality manages a variety of food  and event planning services.

That section can be found 
starting on page 17 of the document.ECONOMIC // GOVERNANCE // RISK SECURITYENSURING CUMMINS VOICE IS HEARD
Cummins’ Government Relations employees work around the world on issues that  
significantly impact the company or the communities where it does business.
The team helps ensure Cummins’ 
voice is heard by government policymakers on issues such as 
the promotion, protection and 
enforcement of global  emission standards; efforts to establish greenhouse gas and 
fuel consumption regulations for 
commercial vehicles, and expanding access to quality education and training. The team has also worked to oppose legislation negatively 
impacting diversity and fair  
treatment for all employees. 
Government Relations is also 
committed to fostering greater 
international cooperation and 
understanding among the various countries where the company operates, frequently hosting international visitors at various  
Cummins sites. 
 
 CORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS 
Cummins bans contributions 
using corporate funds to candidates, political parties and 
independent expenditures, including 
advertisements that support or oppose individual candidates.  The company also will not use 
corporate funds to contribute to  
501 (c) (4) and 527 tax-exempt groups in the United States that are engaged in political activity or make payments to influence ballot issues 
unless the issues are directly tied 
to the company’s core values and business interests. 
In those cases, Cummins is 
committed to publicly disclosing  
any payments including recipient names and amounts. The company made no such payments in this reporting cycle. POLITICAL ACTION 
COMMITTEE 
In the U.S., political contributions 
are made by the Cummins Inc. Political Action Committee (CIPAC), 
funded solely by voluntary employee 
contributions. CIPAC makes contributions to federal and state candidates on a bipartisan basis 
after review and approval by CIPAC’s 
Executive Committee and according to federal and state election law. 
A complete list of the political  
action committee’s contributions  
to candidates is available here. 
CIPAC is governed by corporate 
policies and bylaws that state: 
 »All CIPAC contributions are  
strictly voluntary. 
 »The company will not reimburse 
employees directly or indirectly  for political contributions.   »Employees will not be  pressured to contribute to  CIPAC or make any other  
personal political contribution. 
 »Failure to contribute to CIPAC  
shall not disadvantage an employee’s career in any way. 
CIPAC contributions are based  on the following criteria: 
 »Public integrity of the candidate. 
 »Representation of a Cummins facility or employees. 
 »Support for issues of  importance to Cummins. 
 »Timely and effective  constituent service. 
 »Political leadership or organization. 
 »Support for the company’s values. 
All of CIPAC’s activities are disclosed to the Cummins Board of Directors in an annual political contribution report. MEMBERSHIPS
