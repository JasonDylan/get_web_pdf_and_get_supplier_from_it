We are very glad to take this opportunity to share the com-
pany‚Äôs visions and accomplishments achieved in 2009 
regarding corporate social responsibility through the publi -
cation of Chunghwa Telecom ‚Äôs third ‚ÄúCSR Report. ‚Äù 
The most important part of being socially responsible is to 
manage our core business well. ‚ÄúFocusing on core busi-
nesses, valuing professionalism‚Äù has always been the 
motto of the company. All along, Chunghwa Telecom was 
devoted to its core businesses. By integrating telecommu -
nications and information technology, we provide all cus-
tomers and partners a quality platform for communication 
to help them in their business development and expansion.
Exceptional corporate governance is the key to a com-
pany ‚Äôs sustainable development which is highly valued by 
us. Our persistence in lawful operation and transparent in-
formation contributed to the fact that we are acknowledged 
amongst the most reliable benchmark business proven 
by the various awards received. Facing the constant risks 
brought by climate change and resource consumption, we 
continue to research on innovative integration through in-
formation and telecommunication technologies to develop 
more environmental-friendly products and services. This is 
just part of our ef forts in the area of Green Economy .
Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs Intelligent Energy Network (iEN) 
integrated the telecommunication network and information 
technology to develop customized energy-saving products 
as a total solution that can perform energy consumption 
diagnosis, control, management and improvement. iEN 
can assist corporations to perform centralized monitoring 
of internal electricity-using devices and organize and ana-
lyze data to provide optimal operational environment man-
agement while realizing energy management at the same 
time. For example, after Miao-Li General Hospital started 
to use iEN, 200 million is expected to be saved annually on 
energy costs. This constitutes to a 49.27% saving rate on 
costs and a 400 tons reduction on carbon emission. Per-
formances of other corporate clients that are using the sys -
tem also showed that their energy efficiency could go up 
to over 20% higher than before. Chunghwa Telecom also 
implemented the system on all plants and office buildings 
which won us the 18th Annual Enterprises Environmental 
Protection Award on 2009 by the Environmental Protection 
Administration.
Apart from the above, we practice our commitment in be-
coming an environmental-friendly operation through green 
procurement. In 2009 alone, we spent over NT$206 million 
on green procurement. This not only marks a record within 
Taiwan‚Äôs service industry but also gained us recognition 
from Taipei City on Green Procurement by the Govern-
ment, Private Enterprises and Organizations. Mobile com-
munications equipment waste recycling is also one of our 
key missions in gradually realizing responsible consump-
tion.
Last year, we successfully recycled almost 40 hundred 
waste mobile phones and 20 hundred kilos accessories 
(including batteries). Chunghwa Telecom proved itself to 
be the best in Taiwan in terms of mobile phone recycling.   Over many years, Chunghwa Telecom has accompanied 
Taiwan‚Äôs society in its development and created a strong 
emotional bond with communities. Charity work and pro-
viding care for the disadvantaged is seen as our unshak-
able responsibility. Chunghwa Telecom Foundation and 
local volunteers enabled us to go into remote areas to set 
up ‚ÄúDigital Neighbor sites ‚Äúproviding people with computer 
hardware and software, computer lectures and repair 
services so that the disadvantaged, such as children and 
immigrant spouses, can enjoy the opportunity of learning 
through digital means. 
While the nation was attacked by the Typhoon Morakot 
with flood on August 8th, 2009, our colleagues went into 
the disaster areas at the first instance to complete the mis-
sion of ‚Äúzero communication isolation.‚Äù A disaster relief 
campaign and local produce fairs were also initiated to 
help the people who were affected. We also collaborated 
with Fu Jen Catholic University and made use of our previ -
ous experiences on distance learning in helping children in 
rural areas. A three-year plan is in place to provide children 
in the disaster areas with a quality after-school learning 
environment. 
Being one of the initiators of ADOC 2.0 (see note) from the 
private sector, we integrated the Blind Resources Center 
of Tamkang University to jointly promote the ‚ÄúAssisting the 
Visually-impaired in Telecommuting through ICT Program ‚Äù. 
Chunghwa Telecom and the Center are working hand in 
hand to set up a Call Center for the Visually-impaired so 
that they can enjoy more employment opportunities. Given 
the success of the project, we also exported the complete 
set of operational model to places like the Philippines and 
Beijing to help them set up their own ‚ÄúADOC 2.0 Digital 
Opportunity Center for the V isually-impaired. ‚Äú
In an environment filled with challenges, Chunghwa Tele-
com will enhance our dialogues with different communities 
and partners with the efforts from our staff and support 
from clients to continuously pursue growth and excellence 
for a better future for all.
ADOC 2.0 is the acronym for APEC Digital Opportunity Center 2.0. This is the second phase of the Project for Digital Opportunity Center . 
This project was proposed to APEC and is managed by Taiwan.Note:Chairman

Even though 2009 was a challenging year, our operational performance was still remarkable thanks to the efforts of all 
our hard-working staff. The company ‚Äôs operational performance is summarized as follows: the consolidated revenues 
were NT$ 198.36 billion; Consolidated net income attributable to stockholders of the parent was NT$ 43.76 billion; 
earnings per share after tax was NT$ 4.51; consolidated income tax expenses were NT$ 12.74 billion.
To comply with the company ‚Äôs mid-term development strategies to advance revenues, investments on domestic and 
overseas markets are still strongly promoted. This can not only solidify our core businesses but also boost more en-
ergy for developing emerging businesses and expanding to overseas markets. We strengthen our communication with 
companies we invest in through periodical affiliated enterprises management meetings. During these meetings, we 
review and establish targets and strategies regarding these companies to set up annual operational goals and execu -
tion plans. Annual operational performance reviews of the companies we invested on are also included in our Board 
operational meetings to truly monitor and manage these businesses.

economic downturn.
Internet value-added services such as information security and

main reasons for revenue growth in this area. 
Mainly inÔ¨Çuenced by NCC ‚Äôs demands on lowering connection fees 
and decrease in phone calls due to the economic downturn.
Revenues from FTTx increased since more ADSL users‚Äô were 
upgraded to optical fiber-based broadband. At the same time, 
revenues from ADSL suffered some loses due to such upgrade, 
fierce competition among broadband service providers and NCC‚Äôs 
demands of a price cut. 
The recession caused the rapid replacement of traditional inter-
national communication services by VOIP and other cost-saving 
services. Influenced by the economic downturn and substitution by mobile

On the other hand, investors from around the world are also 
seeing CSR as an important index while evaluating potential

In 2009, Taiwan ‚Äôs efforts on CSR development had a major breakthrough. Taiwan Stock Exchange 
Co. (TWSE) and Gre Tai Securities Market (GTSM) established the ‚ÄúCorporate Social Responsibil -
ity Best Practice Principles for TWSE/GTSM Listed Companies ‚Äù serving as the basic principals for 
CSR.Reinforcing CSR Regulations
Analysis and Responses
on Current Situation
‚ÄùCorporate Social Responsibility Best Practice Principles 
for TWSE/GTSM Listed Companies ‚Äù and GRI G3 comple -
ment each other . One takes the viewpoint of the manage -
ment process while the other of the reporting process. 
Since Chunghwa Telecom ‚Äôs 2008 CSR Report has already 
reached Application Level A, most of the regulations stated 
were already satisfied. Still, there is room for improvement. 
For example: 
Article 6 states that: ‚ÄúThe board of directors of a TWSE/
GTSM-listed company shall exercise the due care of good 
administrators to urge the company to perform its corpo-
rate social responsibility initiatives, examine the results of 
the implementation thereof from time to time and continu -
ally make adjustments so as to ensure the thorough imple -
mentation of its corporate social responsibility policies. ‚Äù 
Article 7 states that ‚ÄúFor the purpose of managing corpo-
rate social responsibility initiatives, TWSE/GTSM-listed 
companies are advised to establish an exclusively (or 
concurrently) dedicated unit to be in charge of proposing 
and enforcing the corporate social responsibility policies or 
systems of the company and to report on the same to the 
board of directors on a periodic basis. ‚Äù
Chunghwa Telecom has already set up a CSR Committee 
and a dedicated window of contact. In the future, a formal 
system will be in place for the Committee‚Äôs Secretariat to 
periodically report back to the Board regarding CSR-relat -
ed work process and directions of development.Sustainable Development
Training Program
The Environmental Education Act was passed by the Legis -
lative Yuan in May 2010 which made Taiwan one of the few 
nations in the world that promote environmental education 
at a legislative level. Article 19 is the one that is most related 
to us. It states that ‚ÄúEmployees of organizations and pub-
licly-operated institutions should receive at least four hours 
of environmental education per year. The results should 
be reported back to the central administrative institution. ‚Äù 
Article 19 nicely responds to Article 15 on the ‚ÄùCorporate 
Social Responsibility Best Practice Principles for TWSE/
GTSM Listed Companies ‚Äù which states that ‚ÄúTWSE/GTSM 
Listed Companies should establish a dedicated unit or as-
sign dedicated personnel for environment management to 
maintain the environment management system and should 
hold environment education courses for their managerial of-
ficers and other employees on a periodic basis. ‚Äù In regards 
of such articles, we set up plans for
All employees receive 4 hours annual training on sus-
tainable development.
Managers of all regions should receive special training in 
terms of external stakeholder communication and partici -
pation and performance evaluation. 1.

The public has grown highly suspicious over how trustwor -

company scandals. We commissioned external financial 
experts to conduct researches on how Chunghwa Tele-
com‚Äôs efforts in carrying out CSR reÔ¨Çect on our brand value. 
Combining our profiting capability index, risk evaluation 
index and market value index, the research showed that 
our stock prices are more stable than others against market

into our daily operation, we performed well in many areas 
which show that introducing the concept of CSR into an

World Business Council for Sus -
tainable Development
Chunghwa Telecom joined the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in 2006. WBCSD is 
the world‚Äôs most influential business alliance concerning 
sustainable development and CSR which has many expe -
riences worth us studying. In 2009, we signed the WBCSD 
Manifesto for Energy Efficiency in Buildings(EEB).
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD): http://www .wbcsd.org/Communication with International En -
vironmental Protection Organizations
In September 2009, we visited various environmental pro-
tection organizations in UK to learn from advanced enter -
prises and organizations ‚Äô experiences and share our per-
formance and results on CSR promotion.
Chunghwa Telecom was also invited to join the ‚ÄúThe 
Prince ‚Äôs Mayday Network, ‚Äù the largest anti-climate change 
corporate organization with over 3,027 British corporations 
as members. We already received the official 2010 May 
Day logo and committed to reduce carbon emission, record 
and respond to climate change tracks, take part in industrial 
initiatives and play out our inÔ¨Çuence on climate change is-
sues along with large British enterprises.Carbon Trust: An independent institution set up by 
the British Government aiming at creating low carbon 
economy. From them, we learned the most advanced 
energy saving and carbon reduction standards and 
specifications, and discussed future long-term strate-
gies together .
Business in the Community (BITC):Dedicated institu-
tion to promote corporate engagement to charity proj-
ects. This visit enabled us to exchange opinions with 
BITC members and brainstorm on how to enhance 
social development with our initial power .Chunghwa Telecom values the opinions of all stakeholders. We proactively communicate with them to 
timely respond to their needs. We also exchange opinions with international advance organizations to 
widen our eyes to more knowledge regarding CSR and sustainable development. Through collaboration 
projects, our commitment is now much more inÔ¨Çuential than before.Response

Board of Directors
Our Board is currently comprised of 13 directors, including 
3 independent directors. To ensure the diversity of mem -
bers, there are one female director , one independent fe-
male director , and one labor director .  We also have 3 su-
pervisors, and two of them are female.  
To enforce the Board ‚Äôs supervising and management func-
tions, three functional committees are in place to take care 
of strategy , audit and compensation. 
Independent directors provide objective opinion according 
to their expertise to assist the Board in making the best 
decisions. To protect directors and supervisors from being 
held personally liable for or suffering any financial loss on a 
litigated event as a result of performing their duties, Chun -
ghwa Telecom ensures that they are covered by indemnity 
insurance. 
Ministry of Transportation and Communications is Chungh -
wa Telecom ‚Äôs largest shareholder with the company Chair -
man and President acting as the government ‚Äôs represen -
tatives. The representatives are responsible for enforcing 
policies and ensure social responsibilities are fulfilled. Each 
year, they need to be evaluated by the Ministry according 
to ‚ÄúSelection, management and evaluation principles on pri-
vate enterprise and juridical person institution representa -
tives assigned by the Ministry of Transportation and Com -

Internal audit is the core of internal control and corporate 
governance. To assess IA‚Äôs conformance to the IIA‚Äôs Inter-
national Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal 
Auditing (Standards), we requested the Institute to conduct 
a quality assessment (QA) of Internal Audit(IA) in 2009. Af-

Regulation Compliance and 
Information T ransparency
Information Disclosure
Being a listed company in Taiwan and having our ADRs 
traded on the New York Stock Exchange requires us to be 
in compliance with all domestic and overseas regulations 
regarding information disclosure. These regulations in-
clude setting up a spokesperson system, publish major an-
nouncement and information as required in a timely manner 
and ensure the accuracy and completeness of information 
published on the corporate website. All issues of interest to 
investors should be made publicly available simultaneously 
in Taiwan and overseas in both Chinese and English to offer 
investors complete and real-time financial and operational 
information of the company . By doing so, we enhance the 
information ‚Äôs degree of transparency and accuracy for in-
vestors to base their decision upon, strengthen investors ‚Äô 
confidence in us and enhance corporate value to benefit 
both parties.Code of Conduct
Our Code of Ethics outlines the ethical standards and re-
sponsibilities required of directors, supervisors, executive 
officers and all employees while engaging in business prac-
tices. This applies to individual employees and groups and 
the corporation when facing the public and all stakeholders. 
An employee report hotline is also in place for all employees 
to express their opinions under a secure and confidential 
mechanism.
We demand our employees to strictly abide by the code of 
ethics and shall never , under any circumstances, compro -
mise to achieve a specific purpose. The goal is to ensure 
compliance of our business practices with legal require -
ments and social ethical standards to prevent any miscon -
duct. The code of ethics is now a part of our corporate train-
ing programs for new employees. Each employee receives 
an annual evaluation and the results are considered as part 
of their performance.
In 2009, 12 violations were reported which involved 13 per-
sons. Besides the needed punishment, review and analysis 
were completed and the Corporation is still working hard on 
further education and promotion.Business Principles
To elevate our business quality and enable consumers to 
have more faith in us, Business Principles were laid out 
firmly to ensure all our acts are in compliance with the laws 
and regulations of administrative organizations. High-level 
managers ‚Äô performance is also evaluated in this regard to 
make sure all employees work together to maintain reputa -
tion and corporate image. Chunghwa Telecom Corporate Code of Ethics

the goal of creating a win-win situation for both the corporation and the investors. As a result, we estab -

employees and our service providers to follow . Management18
Risk Management
Risk Analysis and Response Mechanism
The Regulations clearly set out the framework and process of risk management operations as well as the authorities and re-
sponsibilities assigned to the respective departments. The Regulations require that we carry out risk management of various 
plans of Chunghwa Telecom and subsidiaries including the med-term and long-term development projects, the annual busi-
ness and contingency plans, new implementation projects and business execution reporting according to actual requirements. 
Furthermore, the Regulations also require us to conduct risk analysis, systemized records and follow-up management when 
appropriate.
Currently we adopt a Risk Map as our main evaluation tool which includes statutory risks, risks of network operation, risks of 
market competition and risks of financial operation. At the same time, we continuously conduct sensitivity analysis and pres-
sure testing around the company . Our goal is to bring the losses to a minimum through risk acceptance, risk transfer , risk miti-
gation and risk avoidance. 
After the Ô¨Çood on August 8th, 2009, ‚Äúclimate change ‚Äù was officially included in our ‚Äúperformance and risk management ‚Äù 
evaluation system. Significant risks are all listed in Chunghwa Telecom ‚Äôs annual operation plan and are subject to target 
monitoring and performance evaluation for constant verification and feedbacks.‡†¨·éà·Åç‡¨£‡≠ú·îå›ñ‡ø¥

performing their duties. The President is appointed as the person in charge for any event involving risk 
and crisis management. He is required to report back to the Board of Directors concerning those events.Management19
While discussing actual risks, we continue to follow up on 
regulations related to climate change and evaluate the pos-
sible risks they might cause us. When appropriate, they are 
included in our risk evaluation system for further manage -
ment. By responding to regulation changes early , we not 
only reduce the operational risks but also strengthen our 
image as a green benchmark corporation. 
Risks and opportunities regarding
regulations on climate ChangeOf all the climate abnormalities, torrential rain in a short 
period of time makes the largest impact to Taiwan and 
may badly damage central office and telecommunica -
tion facilities. We need a large amount of budget for pre-
caution plans and disaster relief activities.
Chunghwa Telecom employs over 20 thousand people 
working in all around Taiwan. Contagious diseases that 
are caused by climate change might inÔ¨Çuence our staffs‚Äô 
daily operations and services.
In a long term, temperature increasing and sea level 
rising might significantly inÔ¨Çuence central office opera -
tion and manpower distribution. Extra manpower and 
resources for emergency repairs, emergency power 
supply in the cases of power failure and compensation 
for consumers are all possible causing for additional op-
erational costs.Renewable energy devel -

Supervising Institutions
Any changes in policies or regulations might pose an inÔ¨Çu-
ence on our operational result. That is why we closely moni -
tor every move of the National Communications Commis -
sion (NCC) which oversees all our activities. For example, 
starting in 2007, NCC has been lowering the X value for 
three consecutive years leading to an over 14% reduction 
on mobile phone service charges and an over 19% reduc -
tion in broadband service charges. Without any doubts, we 
are happy to see that broadband is more and more popular 
around the nation and we are glad to help in minimizing the 
digital gap in our society . While striving for satisfying cus-
tomers ‚Äô needs for high-speed broadband, we still believe 
that charges should be fixed according to the market. 
Facing the said operational impacts, besides keep develop -
ing comprehensive value-added services to increase reve-
nue, we also pay close attention to the following regulation/
policies changes and propose countermeasures to tackle 
them:Peer Relationship
In a highly competitive market, service providers ‚Äô profits are 
limited which lead to a lot of concerns regarding the ‚Äúlast 
mile‚Äù from peers and the public. The last mile was released 
in 2004. In 2006, it was announced as a bottleneck mecha -
nism according to which it last mile circuits are leased to 
other fixed network providers under historical cost and the 
number of cores are used as the basis for cost allocation. 
Under the prizing regulations, the last mile charge we ask 
for is the lowest in the world (126 NTD/month). This is about 
30%~50% of the price asked for in Japan. It is evident that 
the price we charge is already the lowest we can af ford to. 
In April 2009, our failure in reaching an agreement on the 
networking charges with other service providers such as 
TFN raised a lot of concern. To settle this dispute, we limited 
parts of TFN‚Äôs bandwidth with consideration for customers ‚Äô 
interests.  
In August of the same year, NCC finally stated that the new 
listed price for connection charges should be1 Mbps/1,480 
NTD. 
To provide customers with good communication quality and 
better services, added with the fact that most of our facili-
ties are reaching their retirement age, we continue to put in 
tens of billions of construction and maintenance funds each 
year for last mile infrastructure. We sincerely hope to create 
a sane and healthy competition environment along with our 
peers in the industry to provide customers with diversified 
and high quality services.Actively participate and provide suggestions in the 
amendment process  of the Telecommunication Law, 
the Cable Radio and Television Law, Broadcasting and 
Television Law , and Satellite Broadcasting Law .
Our GSM 9001800 License are due to expire on 2012
2013. W e will work harder for a license extension.
NCC is expected to release 7 licenses for Second SFN 
of Digital Terrestrial TV in 201 1.
Domestic WiMAX service providers will gradually start 
operating in 2010. Apart from expanding the mobile net-
work coverage and quality , we will speed up the promo -
tion of Fiber to the Building (FTTB) services.Under the inÔ¨Çuence of the financial crisis, the domestic economy did not perform well in 2009. Added with the overÔ¨Çow of suppliers in the 
traditional telecom market and the supervising institutions controlling service charges through administrative means, the whole industry 
was facing fierce challenges from the environment. Under intense competition, peers started to become doubtful of our market position. 
While ensuring the rights of our customers and shareholders, we will continue to communicate with supervising organizations and peer 
service providers.Response Industrial Environment of Fair Competition21
SRI Surveys
We started to reply the two important Socially Responsible 
Investment surveys that are known around the world since 
2008 and 2009: Dow Jones sustainability Indexes (DJSI) 
and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). We firmly believe 
that by replying surveys from high authority institutions, we 
can enhance the transparency of information disclosure 
and encourage CSR management within the company .
On the other hand, even though Socially Responsible 
Investment is at its early stages in Taiwan, we already 
started to conduct CSR surveys on our global institutional 
investors to find out their expectations towards us.  
Institutional Investors CSR 
Engagement 
We take the initiative to send out online questionnaire to lo-
cal and overseas institutional investors to understand their 
views on CSR and SRI. This also shows our determination 
and performance in practicing CSR. The overall return rate 
was lower than expected but from the returned question -
naires, we still managed to find some SRI trends.
When making investment decisions, some institu-
tional investors take whether a company realizes 
its CSR into consideration.
Some questionnaires indicated that ‚Äúcorporate 
governance‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman resource development‚Äù 
are important when evaluating a company‚Äôs per-
formance. Some even take ‚Äúcarbon management‚Äù 
into consideration.
Some institutional investors showed knowledge 
and applauded us for our ef forts on CSR.First telecom service provider to conduct CSR

In order to enable our investors to have a better idea of 
our management strategies and operational performance, 
quarterly meetings are hold and high level managers can 
take the opportunity of non-deal road shows for overseas 
investors to have face to face communication with our 
institutional investors. Apart from the above, we update fi-
nancial and business information on our website in a timely 
manner . At the same time, news releases and importance 
notices regarding the company‚Äôs development are also 
posted on the website for better information transparency .In 2009, along the global trends in Socially Responsible Investment (SRI), the four major government 
funds such as the Labor Pension Fund and the Labor Insurance Fund decided to include a company‚Äôs 
CSR performance into their decision making process for fund investment. In view of this, we will continue 
to communicate with investors and shareholders to reach our ultimate goal of enhancing corporate value.Target Socially Responsible Investment

and the consumer perception of the enterprise but also impact the long-term value.
In response to the forward-looking long-term development of innovation, Chunghwa

synergy with the external R&D institutions to actively improve the processes and prod-

To cope with climate change is an external drive for innovation, Chunghwa Telecom 
in recent years focus its innovation on technology in order to extend its new market 
positioning, and to reduce business risks and operating costs.  In addition, Chunghwa 
Telecom follows the laws and regulations to enhance reputation and legitimacy of the

Elevating Innovation ‚Äôs EfÔ¨Åciency
Understanding the trends in the industry and performing innovation and R&D are the driving forces for 
business growth. Even though we were facing great challenges from the downturn of the global finance 
in 2009, we still invested close to 3.2 billion NTD, the same amount as 2008, on R&D for continuous in-
novation workÔ¨Çow improvement. The investment accounted for 1.71% of the company ‚Äôs revenue of the 
year. Our R&D scale was the largest among our peers in Taiwan.Management

R&D Resources 
Enhance Joint Innovation with 
External ForcesInnovation that BeneÔ¨Åts the 
Society and the Environment
We strive to improve the efficiency of our R&D resource 
and to maintain the quality of our R&D system‚Äôs. Apart 
from setting up the Quality Promotion Working Group (QP), 
Quality Assurance Center (QAC) and Engineering Process 
Group (EPG) under the Chunghwa Telecom Telecommuni -
cation Laboratories (CHTTL), we also introduced interna-
tional regulations and organizational audit systems such as 
ISO quality management system, CMMI(Capability Matu-
rity Model Integration)-based Project Management System 
(CPMS), several R&D process improvement activities for 
standardization. All these efforts are to enable high level 
management to manage audit activities, enhance their 
project management capability, improve products quality, 
fine-tune R&D quality and raise employees ‚Äô quality aware -
ness.
To efficiently and actively integrate the resources from 
CHTTL  and our operational units and to grasp every busi-
ness opportunity , the Laboratories have set up service sta-
tions both in Taipei and Kaohsiung to bring the collective 
power of R&D and marketing to a full play .
We were the pioneers to venture to the Long Term Evolu -
tion (LTE): 4G. We developed a ‚ÄúLTE Trial Network ‚Äù along 
with Ericsson which will enable Taiwan to keep its competi -
tiveness during ICT industry‚Äôs transformation to the next 
generation of mobile broadband services.
In November 2009, we singed a Cloud Computing Stra-
tegic Alliance MOU with Microsoft. In the future, we will 
collaborate with each other regarding cloud computing 
services and facilities and software applications at the user 
end. We hope that this new operation model can open up 
more cloud computing-based business opportunities for 
both companies.
In terms of Smart Grid Technology, Chunghwa Telecom 
plans to have the 23,000 users of the industrial high volt-
age (11000 V) whose usage accounts  for 50% of the total 
electricityin Taiwan completed the switching to Smart Me-
ter by 2012. To achieve this goal, we are currently working 
with Tatung Co. to develop Smart Meters. Tatung Co. is in 
charge of the development of the hardware whilewe focus 
on the the development of wireless data transmission. 
Smart Meters are currently being tested in small areas. It 
is our desire to continue being the pioneer and the leader 
in the field of Smart Grid for the future.Innovative products and services that focus on the environ -
mental protection and the social issues-solving will be cru-
cial  to a companyto compete globally in the future. As the 
leader of the industry bearing a mission on CSR, we already 
made environmental and social innovation the core mission 
of our future R&D strategies. We will invest our resources 
in a well-planned matter so as to benefit the society , the 
environment and the company .

Chunghwa T elecom Application 
ContestInternal Employee Business 
Starting
In 2003, we started to host the ‚ÄúTelecommunications Value-
adding Application Contest ‚Äù for college students. It is now 
seen as the Oscar Award in the telecommunication field. 
Every year, the contest attracts more than 2000 teams to 
participate. Upon to the 7th year (2009), the total number of 
participants has already exceeded 17,000.
The 2009 Telecommunications Value-adding Application 
Contest was divided into 5 groups: ‚ÄúBroadband Value-
adding Group ‚Äù, ‚Äú3G Mobile Life Application Group ‚Äù, ‚Äú3G 
Campus Mobile Application Group ‚Äù, ‚ÄúFixed-network Value-
adding Group ‚Äù and ‚ÄúICT Application Group ‚Äù. We took this 
opportunity to recruit the talents from participating teams to 
join us in our R&D branches and CHTTL.
In the future, we will continue to tie the topic of the con-
test closely to our businesses and continue to invite more 
and more students with different backgrounds to participate 
the contests. For example, in 2010, we plan to add another 
group, ‚ÄúIntegrated Marketing Group ‚Äù for business school 
students.
In addition to educational training, we also encourage our 
employees to start their businesses within the company. 
Currently, Chunghwa Leading Photonics Tech (CLPT) 
has been evaluated and approved internally to carry our 
enterprise incubation under CHTTL. 
The team utilizes CHTTL‚Äôs Optical Transceiver Module 
manufacturing facilities to develop a new generation of 
Short-wave Infrared Imaging Module while at the same 
time devotes itself to enhance the technologies for the 
industry. So far, products are on a trial sale to European 
nations and the team has been working with European 
equipment manufacturers to develop environmental pro-
tection-related applications such as solar panel crack 
inspection or waste classification inspection.  At the mo-
ment, the team is seeking investments from relevant in-
dustries in hope to bring theR&D results to life as a prod-
uct and to truly accomplish the value-adding application 
on technology and service.Facing the constant change of telecommunication applications, diversified life experiences are the source 
of innovation. In addition to our own R&D departments and external technological partners, we welcome 
college students and everyone in the company to engage R&D activities and offerR&D positions and op-
portunity to start-up new business internally  to bring R&D results to a full play .Management26

establishing a rescue and disaster relief mobile satel -
lite system, and to solve the communication difficul-
ties in rural areas, at sea, in mountain areas or disas -
ter areas, we introduced the famous Thuraya satellite 
communications system to Taiwan. Via satellite com-
munication, positioning technologies and internet, we 
can provide our services to every corner of the island.
hiCloud CaaS (Computing as a Service) is a brand 
new cloud computing service that we developed. 
Such service provides customers with a virtual 
computing environment that can be operated on 
various operation systems (Windows, Linux, etc). 
Customers can enjoy the safest, most stable and 
most reliable internet environment. Apart from that, 
customers can integrate their customized applica-
tion settings and programs to perform the services 
they need.Through SaaSSoftware as a Service, we enable 
SMEs to perform CRM using cloud computing under 
a limited budget and help them to enhance their op-
erational value. Besides providing enterprises with a 
full range of CRM applications, customers can apply 
for value-adding services such as MMS, eDM or fax 
application. This way, SMEs can lower their IT cost 
and elevate their operational efficiency .As the leader of the Alliance of Cloud Computing Technolo -
gies and Applications (ACCT A), we already launched vari-
ous innovative services in cloud computing.
eICT is the perfect demonstration of our innovative vision. Looking into the future development of the 
ICT industry , we know that in-depth R&D and new applications are not enough. All the technology and 
development will be tightly connected to sustainable operation and corporate responsibility. Therefore, 
we revisited our innovative R&D missions and laid down three Es with communication technology as the 
foundation and information technology for the path of development. The three Es are as follows.
1.

3.Energy: Use renewable energy and reduce energy consumption.
Environment: Reduce the amount of resource used and monitor changes in our environment.
Empower: Care for the disadvantaged groups and provide assistance to social development.Address eICT Innovation27
Environment
Saving Energy
Continuously utilizing our core expertise in telecommunica -
tion technology , we developed various innovative energy-
saving and carbon-reducing products. Internally , we can 
effectively reduce the amount of energy consumed while 
externally , we can provide customers with a complete range 
of energy-saving products and services. We are fully committed to innovative R&D in communica-
tion networks. Through outstanding R&D capability and 
our expertises in communications and network, we have 
developed many resource-efficient products that reduces 
burden on the environment.
Industry and Business CertiÔ¨Åcation Smart 
Cards and Card Issuing System of MOEA
To help promote ICT services, we have developed a 
new generation of Hi-COS 2048 bits Smart Card sys-
tem. The system has already passed all inspections by 
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) in December 
2009. In January 2010, the Distributed Card Issuing 
System was brought online and started its operation. 
In 2009, we held 100% market share in Industry and 
Business Certificate and expect to issue one million 
certificates  by the end of 2010. Looking forward, we 
anticipate to see more than  130 million transactions 
completed through this service with a large saving on

As the citizens in Taiwan, we know it is our responsibility to 
contribute back to the society . Other than setting up tele-
communication and internet infrastructures in remote areas, 
we will continue to pay attention to the needs of all people 
in the society , including those at disadvantage, and to help 
develop more innovative products for the realization of so-
cial welfare values.
Smart Mobile National Self Care
With our innovation, we entered the family preventive 
medical market in which we applied CIT to health -
care and medical treatment services. Users can con-
duct measurement at specific locations of their limbs 
(nerves and veins) and transmit the data to the remote 
database for  matching and analysis. From the ana-
lyzed data, users will be able to retrieve information 
regarding his/her personal health for future health 
management. This is very helpful in saving medical 
resources and transportation-related resources from 
hospital visits.

Assisting the V isually Impaired to 
Work Remotely via ICT
In 1988, we joined the group of ‚ÄúComputer for Blind Peo-
ple‚Äù hosted by the Ministry of Education. Alongside Tam-
kang University Resource Center for the Visually Impaired 
Students, we developed the ‚ÄúChinese Information Applica -
tion System for the Visually Impaired.‚Äù We committed to 
provide the visually impaired with a brand new integrated, 
multifunctional and intelligent telecommunication service 
that can truly satisfy their needs of a barrier-free commu-
nication environment in order to enable them to enjoy the 
wide range of resources on the internet and thus increase 
their opportunities in education and employment. 
After years of hard-work, our efforts in combining research 
with practice brought fruitful results. Our self-developed 
TTS software was applied to the ‚ÄúChinese/English Informa-
tion System for the Visually Impaired.‚Äù Working in combi-
nation with the ‚ÄúBarrier-free Mobile Computer Cluster ,‚Äù this 
system enabled the visually challenged to share the rich 
results of digital development with the rest of the society .

tional IPv6 Ready Logo testing standard.
In 2003, Chunghwa Telecom was commissioned by the 
government to conduct individual IPv6 standard testing 
projects and has since devoted itself to promote local 
relevant technologies. In the past few years, we assisted 
domestic companies to obtain the International IPv6 Cer-
tificate (ranked third in the world in terms of total number of 
certificates granted) and actively participated in activities 
regarding International IPv6 Standard Testing. We are one 
of the founding members of the IPv6Ready Logo Commit -
tee and our IPv6 Standard Testing Lab is one of the five 
IPv6 certified labs recognized internationally . In the future, 
we will continue to research on and develop relevant 
standard testing kits to ensure we master the key technol -
ogy for the next generation internet infrastructure so as to 
provide assistance for future network technology develop -
ments.
We organized ‚ÄúGPON (Gigabit-capable Passive Optical 
Network) ‚Äù testing activities for two consecutive years since 
2008. This was to speed up the comprehensiveness and 
maturity of local GPON providers‚Äô products and drive the 
business opportunities of the optical broadband communi -
cation industry forward to bring a win-win effect on HiNet ‚Äòs 
network infrastructure.Our full-scale ICT collaboration with the Industrial Technol -

After inventory and verification of statistics, our total emis-

higher than the level provided by system measurements in 
last year‚Äôs report. The total of 2009 GHG emissions reached 
926,063.03 t-CO2e by system measurements. This resulted 
from a continuous growing need for the telecom services 
and introduction of the next-generation telecommunications 
and internet facilities. Therefore, growth in electricity con-
sumption in each telecommunications point leads to a slight 
increase in GHG emissions. Results of the inventory and verification show that exter-
nally purchased electricity constitutes the main source of 
GHG emissions. Thus, the main strategy to cut our GHG 
emissions is to take actions in managing electricity use 
and cut the electricity consumption.

We announced specific enegy saving targets in 2009. We 
promised that excluding the growth in business due to the 
introduction of the next-generation internet facilities, the 
electricity use in 2012 will be reduced by 12% from the 
2007 level. The reduction is equal to 168 million GWh of 
electricity and approximately 1 10,000 metric tons of CO2.
For the switching offices that consume more electricity, 
we plan to adopt the iEN to control the air conditioning 
of the switching offices; for telecommunications facilities 
such as electricity, switches, transmitters, mobile, internet 
receivers, we adopt energy-saving methods like renewal, 
replacement, consolidation, and optimizations; as for pro-
curement, we will choose facility providers that meet inter-
national green energy standards, so that we can reduce 
the electricity consumption of switching offices. With the 
above action plans, we intend to reduce the electricity use 
of switching offices by 138 GWh in 2012 from the 2007 
level. For administrative office buildings, we apply the iEN 
on current office buildings first and use the smart energy-
saving system as well as corporate intnernal management 
platform, plan to save electricity by 30 GWh by the end of 
2012. The energy saving ratio reaches 7.85% and we will 
take the challenge of 10%.With continuous promotion of energy-saving practices for 
internal switching offices and office buildings, as well as ris-
ing awareness of employees and exclusion of the increased 
amount of electricity due to introduction of the next-gener -
ation facilities, the total electricity consumption was cut by

Mobile Business Group for example. In 2009 with active 
participation of all of the employees, there were more than 
200 people that received the training of ISO 14001; a to-
tal of 4 internal promotions were held, and participating 
employees accounted for more than 300 person-times. 
Besides, 138 employees were awarded the certificates of 
‚ÄúImplementing an ISO 14001 Environmental Management 
System‚Äù and 127 employees were awarded qualified ‚ÄúIn-
ternal Auditors.‚Äù With the back-up of complete knowledge 
and experts, we can take proper and correct actions.Global climate change has a lot to do with water resources. 
Noting the change in the extreme weather, we started to 
include water resouces into the management. Besides in-
cluding leakage into the detection function in the products, 
we also include the water consumption of the company 
into the environmental sustainability management system, 
manging and analyzing with the informationalized inter-
face. We also continue to promote water-saving practices 
such as recycling and reuse of the rainfall and household 
wastewater .
In order to provide good-quality connection along the 
coastline, we set up facilities upon the He-T ien Hill in 
Hualien. To solve problems with air conditioning of 
switching offices and water for daily use, we collect 
rain in the most natural way: filters are installed in rain 
drainage in the buildings; storage tanks were digged 
out underground for use during maintenance.Recycling of the Rainfall
The telecommunications industry generates low pollution, but we are aware that energy and resources 
consumed in the process of operation would still impact the environment. Therefore, we established sound 
management procedures and built environmental awareness, taking active initiatives that were good for 
the environment.ManagementEnvironmental Sustainability Man -

In 2009, making ‚Äúenvironmental protection and 
energy-saving‚Äù as the theme, we renovated the out-
look platform and skylight in the auditorium of the 
Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories. With the energy-
saving design, the auditorium can cut approximately 
5,760 kWh of electricity per year, which saves about 
NT$20,000 and reduces GHG emissions by 4000 kg. 
Even though the direct effects are limited, the mes-
sage of energy saving for users of the auditorium will 
perform multiplying effects. This renovation project 
received positive feedback from the Environmental 
Protection Administration, and the auditorium was 
designated as the venue for the ‚Äú2009 Corporate En-
vironmental Protection Award ‚Äù Seminar .The Energy Saving AuditoriumIncreasing the Energy EfÔ¨Åcien -
cy in BuildingsPledging to the Manifesto of ‚ÄúEn-
ergy EfÔ¨Åciency in Buidlings ‚Äù
In 2009, we started to focus on increasing the energy ef-
ficiency of construciton like office buildings. Setting targets 
in creating zero energy consumption to minimize environ-
mental impacts, we tried different solutions and deployed 
actions to increase the energy efficiency of buildings by im-
proving systems, constructing green buildings, and adopt -
ing the innovative behavior management, and etc. In 2009, as a Taiwanese member company , we pledged to 
the ‚ÄúManifesto for Energy Efficiency in Buildings‚Äù initiated 
by the World Business Coucil for Sustainable Developmet 
(WBCSD). We will voluntarily put the manifesto into prac-
tice.
One of the switching offices of Chunghwa Telecom is 
located in Mt. JiJida in Jhongliao Township, Nantou 
County. It is a nexus of telecommunications in the 
central Taiwan area. In September 2008, Typhoon 
Sinlaku stroke Taiwan with violent rain, collapsing the 
retaining wall of the office and breaking the road by 
the down slope. We immediately took emergency ac-
tions to ensure the safety of the office, and decided 
to adopt the ecological engineering method to rebuild 
the retaining wall on the slope. Meanwhile, we en-
gaged factors such as greening and integration of 
views in the reconstruction of permanent retaining 
walls. This construction work was completed in June 
2009, and it successfully passed the test of Typhoon 
Morakot.The Ecologically Engineered Switching OfÔ¨ÅceChunghwa Telecom has more than 1,800 operation offices across Taiwan. We hope that by effectively in-
creasing the energy efficiency of buildings, we will reduce the operational costs, enhance the production 
power of employees, and reach the energy-saving targets.Address
WBCSD Manifesto for Energy 
Efficiency in BuildingsChunghwa Telecom‚Äôs responding 
actions
We already disclosed our 
preliminary target of carbon 
management in the 2008 CSR 
repor: GHG emissions in 2013 
would be mitigated to the level 
of 2008. We also set targets in 
reducing the energy consump-
tion. Response to the Manifesto for Energy 
EfÔ¨Åciency in Buildings
The chapter of environmental 
sustainability in the CSR report 
clearly discloses our carbon 
management policy. Currently 
we are promoting the assess-
ment of enengy efficiency in 
buildings and improvement 
projects. 
‚ÄúThe Evaluation on Energy 
Saving Performance‚Äù is con-
ducted in each business group 
and operation office regularly; 
among all, the electricity use 
and energy conservation prac-
tices in the offices are included 
in the performance review . 
‚ÄúGHG Emissions Inventory Proj-
ects‚Äù are conducted regularly 
every year. Meanwhile, through 
the ‚Äúenvironmental sustainabil-
ity management system,‚Äù we 
can know well and disclose the 
situation of CO2 emissions.
Regular activities include ‚ÄúEner-
gy-saving training,‚Äù publication 
of ‚Äúenergy saving brochures,‚Äù 
as well as promotion posters 
and slogans for enegy saving 
of buildings.
Energy-saving practices and 
experiences are shared on the 
CHT interactive platform 
Consumers are encouraged to 
use electronic bills and others.
‚ÄúThe Evaluation on Energy

Solar Power Supply System
In 2009, we built the country ‚Äôs first solar power supply sys-
tem that supplies power for cellphones, e-bulletin board, 
and telecommunications, and etc. The generated power not 
only can be supplied for facilities, but also serve as a sup-
port during power failure. The promise of ‚Äúno power , but you 
can still call‚Äù is fulfilled.  In order to increase the manage -
ment efficiency , our solar power supply system has a visu-
alized interface that enables the superintender to monitor 
daily solar radiation, the temperature of solar panels, the 
temperature, output electricity , warnings and etc. immedi -
ately online. Both the Fangshan switching office of the In-
ternational Business Group as well as the Hueilai Switching 
Office of the Southern Business Group won ‚Äú2009 Golden 
Sun Shooter Award ‚Äîexcellent demonstration of solar pow-
er applications. ‚Äù 
We have established 20 sets of ‚Äúthe solar power supply sys-
tem,‚Äù whose total capacity was 92.7kWp and 128 sets of the 
solar water heater , whose toal area of the heating modules 
were 483.52ƒî. With devices of solar power supply system 
and other energy-saving designs, we can have effects on 
energy conservation in switching offices and buildings.Green Procurement Benchmark  
Expenditure on Environmental 
ProtectionIn 2009, the amount of our green procurement was 
NT$206 million. According to the Environmental Protection 
Administration, there were a total of 20 companies whose 
expenditure on green procurement exceeded NT$20 mil-
lion. Consolidating all the branches, Chunghwa Telecom 
was ranked the first in the tertiary sector, and the third 
among all. All of Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs operation offices 
have signed the consent form of green procurement, ac-
tively participating in green procurement-related activities 
promoted by local governments. If the expenditure on 
green procurement was sorted by administrative districts, 
Taipei City with NT$109 million was the most, Taoyuan 
County with NT$27.84 million came the second, and Kaoh -
siung City with NT$20.22 million was the third. 
We also actively responded to the green store policy pro-
moted by the Environmental Protection Administration, 
becoming the first private company that joined the green 
stores as an employee cooperative, and encouraging em-
ployees to consider green products first. Our efforts won 
us positive feedback from the Taipei City Government as 
the benchmark of ‚Äúprivate enterprises and organizations in 
green procurement,‚Äù and as the promoting green store in 
‚Äúbettering marketing channels and procurement informa-
tion of environmental products. ‚Äù
The total of the expenditure on environmental protection in 
2009 was NT$468.5 million. We encouraged development 
of the green industry with tangible actions.

take advantage of Chunghwa Telecom ‚Äôs buildings, actively developing and adopting renewable energy; 
therefore, we can ensure energy conservation, carbon reduction and provide continuous telecommunica -
tions services even during the power failure.Address Green Procurement and Renewable Energy38
Bill Integration and Electronic Bills
To promote the integration of bills, we decided to start with 
the phone bills because they consumed the most paper . By 
the end of 2009, 86% of customers have already integrated 
their bills. This saves us 240 million pieces of paper per 
year, which is equal to saving 20,000 trees and a reduction 
of 4000 tons of CO 2 emission. To further our action in going 
paperless, we started the service of online billing in August 
2005; customers can make online inquries, pay online, and 
analyze the bills online, and etc. By the end of 2009, e-bill 
has been provided for 2.83 million cellphone numbers. This 
saves 1.62 million pieces of paper , equal to saving 4,400 
trees, and a reduction of 79 tons of CO 2 emissions. 
Recycling W aste Mobile T elecom -
municaion Products Project
Mobile telecommunications technology advances rapidly , 
and innovative products are always available in market. Af-
ter waste mobile phones are recycled and treated, we can 
avoid the toxic substances contained in the waste ones to 
contaminate the envrionemnt in the process of incineration 
or landfill. Besides, some substances in the waste mobile 
phones can be reused, and we can reduce the consumption 
of the resources and energy on the Earth.
On December 30, 2008, we signed the ‚ÄúMemorandum for 
Collaboration on Recycling Waste Mobile Telecommunica -
tions Products ‚Äù with the Environmental Protection Adminis -
tration, Executive Yuan. Regardless of the brand and types, 
people can bring their waste mobile phones and accesso -
ries such as batteries, and rechargers to the 319 service 
centers and 210 stores of the Senao International Co., Ltd, 
a subsidiary company of the Chunghwa Telecom. In 2009, 
we recycled 39,807 waste mobile phones; 19,120 kg of bat-
teries and accessories. This is the most effective mobile 
phone recycling project across Taiwan.Coastal Cleanup on Earth Day
The Clean Neighborhood ActionsOn the eve of 2009 Earth Day, Chunghwa Teleocm initi-
ated a series of beach cleaning activities, protecting the 
seashore from the north to the south. In the north, Mr. 
Siao-Tung Chang, the General Manager, led 250 people, 
consisiting of employees and their families from the Head -
quaters and Shilin Operation Office. They cleaned the 
beach along the Shitsao Coast in Laomay Village, Shih-
men Township, Taipei County. In the Taoyuan, Hsinchuh 
and Miaoli district, the Telecom Laboratoies joined the 
Coast Guard Administration, Executive Yuan in the spring 
beach cleaning activity in the Yong An Snow Forest in 
Sinwu Township, Taoyuan County . The Hsinchu Operation 
Office took part in the beach cleaning activities along the 
Ciding coast. The Tainan Operation Office participated in 
the beach cleaning activities held by the Environmental 
Protection Bureau, Tainan City. To show the commitment to 
protecting the environment with energy-saving practices, 
on the day of April 22, the light was turned off in all of the 
offices for an hour at noon. 
We actively engaged ourselves in the EPA-promoted corpo -
rate action plan ‚Äúthe Clean Neighborhood, ‚Äù working togeth -
er on cleaing the neighborhood and commiting ourselves 
to environmental protection in the community . In January 
2009, the environmental volunteer service team was of-
ficially formed. Taking the responsibility of a big neighbor , 
employees are expected to be more concerned about their 
neighbors and communities and to maintain the quality of 
the environment spontaneously . With actions, we greatly in-
creased the efficiency in cleaning and maintaining the sani-
tary of each community and were awarded ‚ÄúClean Commu -
nity Award ‚Äù by the Environmental Protection Administraiton.Chunghwa Telecom hopes to mitigate their environmental impacts together with the customers by encour -
aging its employees to take part in environmental protection activities and to decorate the office with plants. 
During the past three years, we have worked hard on promoting integration of bills and e-bills, and effects 
have shown. In late 2008, we started to promote the recycling of cellphones, and through the cooperation 
with a subsidiary company Senao International Co., Ltd., we have recycled approximately 40,000 waste 
cellphones. ResponseEnvironmental Protection Actions and Ethical

Roadmap of Supply Chain Management
2008 2009 2010 2011~2013Chunghwa T elecom ‚Äôs Roadmap of Supply Chain ManagementChunghwa Telecom is the first company that made supply chain management policy in the domestic telecommunications 
industry . In 2008 we officially declared the ‚ÄúSupplier Environment, Human Rights and Ethics Principles. ‚Äù Besides asking sup-
pliers to comply with domestic labor and environmental regulations on the basis of the procurement requirements, we called 
on the three main departments-the internet, the supply, and the administrative management- to complete the questionnaire 
‚ÄúSurvey on Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs Supplier Corporate Social Responsibility‚Äù based on the ‚ÄúElectronics-Tool for Accountable 
Supply Chains ‚Äù (E-TASC) developed by the Global e-Sustainability InitiativeGeSI in 2009. Permitted by the CSR committee, 
the ‚ÄúChunghwa Telecom Ethical Supply Chain Management ‚Äù action was officially launched.  
Since 2010, starting with suppliers that we have a big portion of procurement from and that are inÔ¨Çuential to the society and 
environment, we will send questionnaires and hold a suppliers‚Äô general meeting. In addition to understanding our suppliers‚Äô 
current CSR performance (labor rights and environment in particular), we would like to let suppliers understand our CSR strat-
egy and practices by communicating and interacting with them. Through our inÔ¨Çuence, we hope to deepen the roots of CSR in 
Taiwan.

Organization Conventions by forbidding discrimination in any form, coerced labor and the use of child 
labor . Management
CHT is the only telecommunications operator in Taiwan 
to have set up a company union and signed a collective 
bargaining agreement with employees. Apart from con-
forming to stringent local and overseas regulations, it also 
demonstrates our commitment to protecting the rights of 
our employees. The collective bargaining agreement not 
only guarantee employees‚Äô right to make suggestions, 
submit complaints and join a trade union, but also require 
a labor relations meeting to be convened every 3 months 
by management and worker representatives at the head 
office and regional branches. Extraordinary labor relations 
meetings may also be held as necessary and workers‚Äô 
representatives may attend meetings on personnel evalu-
ations, performance reviews and business reports. A di-
rectorship on the CHT Board is also reserved for workers ‚Äô 
representatives in accordance with the resolution passed 
by the Legislative Yuan on June 6, 2003, enabling labor 
participation in Board affairs.  In 2009, up to 99.3% of all 
CHT employees were union members.
CHT‚Äôs President and CEO frequently meet or talk with the 
president, directors and auditors from the union to ensure 
a clear line of communications between the employer and 
labor. A total of six national labor relations meetings and 
two extraordinary meetings were held in 2009, with con-
sensus achieved on several related issues. 13 negotiations 
on labor relations (performance review and the issuing of 
performance bonuses) were also convened and a conclu -
sion reached, effectively enhancing harmony in labor rela-
tions.
The starting salary for all new employees is set above the 
minimum wage required by law. Affected units and person -
nel are also notified in advance of organizational restruc-
turing or transfers and assignments updated as necessary . 
The above measures all serve to enhance harmony in 
labor relations.
For exceptional contract employees working in customer 
service or operations support, we have a program in place 
to offer them full-time employment. The program is our 
way of taking care of local contract workers at our regional 
branches.We join other large international enterprises in embrac-
ing the ten general principles of the United Nations Global 
Compact, and oppose corruption and bribery in any form. 
We will not make any political contributions other than the 
payment of legal taxes.
In support of the UN International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights being incorporated into do-
mestic law in December 2009, CHT will work to increase 
employee awareness on human rights to ensure that CHT 
employees, customers, suppliers, investors and local com-
munities are all treated with respect and fairness.

In human rights, the Global Compact asks busi-
nesses to respect and uphold the international 
conventions on human rights and to not take part 
in ignoring or violating human rights under any cir-
cumstances. In labor standards, the Global Com-
pact calls on businesses to respect the freedom of 
association, acknowledge labor ‚Äôs right to collective 
bargaining, eliminate all forms of coerced labor, 
stop the use of child labor and eliminate any dis-
crimination in employment.
Article 6: ‚ÄúAn industrial union or craft union shall 
be organized in accordance with law, which work -
ers of full 20 years of age, of the same industry in 
the same area or in the factory or workshop, or in 
the same area and in the craft, exceed the number

Increasing Employment
CSR Review for ExecutivesTelecom T raining Institute
Elite Development PartnershipPerformance ReviewIn 2009, CHT continued to offer increased employment op-
portunities to help reduce unemployment and recruited 434 
new employees through competitive examination. Due to 
our strategy of diversification and support of government 
initiatives in the six emerging industries of green energy , 
biotechnology , healthcare, boutique agriculture, tourism 
and creative culture, we have embraced employee incen -
tive training programs to develop and retain the next gen-
eration of telecommunications expertise.
CHT has established a comprehensive performance re-
view system that standardizes performance reviews for 
employees at all levels.
We also ensure that every employee can discuss every 
part of their performance directly with their supervisor. All 
managers are required to conduct face-to-face interviews 
throughout the review process. By helping employees un-
derstand their expected roles and responsibilities as well 
as provide guidance on career planning, the system helps 
to boost employee morale and organizational loyalty .
To ensure that CSR strategy and business strategy comple -
ment each other at CHT, performance reviews for execu -
tives look at not only traditional financial indicators but also 
take into consideration their response to stakeholder opin-
ions, realization of environmental management targets and 
improvement of CHT ‚Äôs charitable image. The Telecom Training Institute (TTI) organizes competen -
cy training courses each year to systematically train em-
ployees on core networking technologies, access network 
technologies, mobile communications technologies, value-
added services, information technology , business manage -
ment, operations management and human resources man-
agement. 
To enhance the capability of the management team, the TTI 
also hosts regular leadership training courses and training 
for exceptional managers assigned to re-investment sub-
sidiaries as executives or shareholder representatives. 
In 2009, a total of 1.92 million hours of actual employee 
training were conducted through physical classes and dis-
tance education at a total cost of $661.36 Billion.
In addition to internal training, CHT also partners with re-
spected outside educational institutions to cultivate ex-
pertise in telecommunications technology and boost our 
industrial competitiveness. In 2008, the TTI partnered 
with the National Taiwan University to host the ‚ÄúAdvanced 
Telecommunications Network Technologies ‚Äù program. The 
4-semester program consists of 50 places and has been 
very successful in giving students a solid grounding tele-
communications network theory . We also encourage gen-
eral employees to embrace lifelong learning with education 
subsidies of up to $30,000 per semester . In 2009 a total of 
1,142 employees applied for in-service education subsidies 
and total spending amounted to NT$16,530,000.

commitment of ‚Äúno retrenchments, no salary cuts and no unpaid leave‚Äù so employees can continue to 
focus on their work. In 2009, we invested 3.1% of our annual revenues in personnel development and 
employee education. Average spending on employee training has remained steady despite the global 
financial crisis.Management Recruitment and T raining45
CHT offers healthcare that exceeds statutory requirements 
and all employees are eligible for a free health checkup 
once a year. In 2009, we hosted 230 health workshops as 
well as 32 physical competitions and 111 excursions to im-
prove employee fitness and introduce them to the beauty 
of Taiwan. The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is 
also continuing to provide employees with one-to-one con-
sultation on mental, legal, financial, medical, work and life-
style issues. Total cost of employee healthcare amounted 
to 0.15% of annual revenues.
CHT encourages employees to spend time outdoors and 
enjoy nature. Unused dormitories around Taiwan have 
been refurbished into the ‚ÄúCHT Te-lodgings ‚Äù managed on a 
part-time, semi-self service basis by CHT employees. The 
Te-lodgings feature many green initiatives such as unified 
purchasing of supplies, solar powered water heater and bi-
cycle rental. The Te-Lodgings also promote environmental 
friendly travel. There are now 29 Te-lodgings throughout 
Taiwan with a total of 460 rooms.Balancing W ork and Family
The Taiwanese society will increasingly feel the impact of 
an aging population and decreasing birth-rate in the future. 
To encourage employees to embrace their responsibili-
ties as parents as well as balance their work and family, 
CHT introduced unpaid parental leave in July 2006, with 
employees on unpaid parental leave entitled to receive a 
parenting subsidy equivalent to half of their insured salary 
for up to two years. Other benefits include family leave, 
paternity leave, menstrual leave and nursing rooms. In 
2009 there were 155 applications for maternity leave, 55 
applications for unpaid parental leave and 53 applications 
for parenting subsidy .Health BeneÔ¨Åts

Volunteer Service Act
Volunteer T raining Program
Corporate V olunteer ServiceTo realize the ideal of working together for a civil society, 
CHT released Taiwan‚Äôs first ever corporate volunteer ser-
vice guidelines and service plan on November 30 in 2007. 
The plan encourages employees to participate in volunteer 
service and a comprehensive management scheme will be 
gradually developed.
To ensure the safety and health of corporate volunteers as 
well as protect the rights of service recipients, CHT offers 
special training in addition to the basic statutory require-
ments to maximize volunteer contributions and raise the 
standard of service. A total of 6,692 hours of volunteer 
training (including both basic and special training) were 
completed in 2009.
As of the end of 2009, 892 CHT employees (3.72% of the 
total workforce) have completed statutory volunteer train-
ing and received the national ‚ÄúVolunteer Service Logbook ‚Äù. 
CHT has drawn upon both corporate and social resources 
to organize a variety of different charity activities, contribut -
ing a total of 41,979 hours of corporate volunteer service in 
2009.Paid V olunteer Leave
The current volunteer leave system provides each employ -
ee with a set amount of volunteer leave each year . 
As CHT employees over 20,000 people throughout Taiwan, 
if every employee makes full use of their volunteer leave 
we can provide community groups with a huge source of 
manpower and contribute to the development of the civil 
society in Taiwan.
Volunteer Service ActWe encourage employees to participate in charity activities 
to enrich their life experience. To learn about employee 
preferences on volunteer activities an internal online sur-
vey was carried out. The results showed that employee 
preferences in volunteering were as follow:Employee Participation Survey
Helping students in remote rural regions with e-learning 
and computer repairs (22.94%)
Participation in eco-conservation activities (20.08%)
Community relations building (19.95%)
Article 7 (Implementation of service plan)
Voluntary service utilization units shall utilize 
volunteers in accordance with voluntary service 
plans.
Voluntary service plans, as referred to in the prec-
edent Paragraph, shall cover volunteer personnel 
recruitment, training, management, utilization, 
guidance, evaluation and service scopes.
Article 9 (V olunteer education & training)
In order to enhance the quality of voluntary ser-
vice, and safeguard the rights and interests of ser-
vice recipients, voluntary service utilization units 
shall provide the following training to volunteers:
(1) Basic training
(2) Special trainingCorporate volunteering is an extension of CSR. To encourage our employees to be proactive in giving 
back to the community , volunteer leave is now officially recognized in the personnel system. Flexible vol-

Brand Management Strategy
CSR Brand DevelopmentThe General Manager of CHT is also the Brand Manager 
in charge of supervising the creation, management and 
modification of all CHT brands. The Brand Manager also 
communicates with the deputy brand manager of each 
business group through the CSR committee. The role of 
deputy brand managers is undertaken by the deputy gen-
eral managers of each business division. Their responsi-
bility is to carry out the overall corporate brand strategy 
as well as promoting their brands in their own way to the 
extent of their authority . 
‚ÄúChunghwa Telecom‚Äù is the byword for absolute depend-
ability in Taiwan. We have therefore adopted a supportive 
brand framework where all secondary brands are semanti -
cally or visually linked to CHT . 
We have also adopted a variety of performance indicators 
including market/product penetration, customer loyalty/sat -
isfaction, brand value, employee and recruitment/retention 
to measure brand ‚Äôs inÔ¨Çuence on long-term development.
CHT does not want to be just a ‚Äúgreen‚Äù brand but also to 
be the No. 1 ‚ÄúTelecom CSR‚Äù brand in Taiwan. CSR is a key 
strategy in all of our activities as it helps to boost customer 
acceptance, preference and loyalty. CSR can also enhance 
employee loyalty, creating a positive feedback cycle. For 
this reason, the General Manager (Brand Manager) regu-
larly meets with executives in charge of CSR strategy and 
development to discuss how business strategy and CSR 
strategy can complement each other .
Framework of the Brand ManagementHigh Quality Product/Services
Free Customer EducationIt has always been our strategy to provide high quality 
products/services. In terms of the actual products and 
services, we passed the 3G mobile telephony service qual -
ity survey conducted by the NCC in 2009. The results of 
quality testing from CHT‚Äôs data access network are also 
reported to the NCC on a monthly basis. The key perfor-
mance indicators are as listed below and our performance 
has consistently exceeded the standards defined by the 
NCC. 
We are also continuing to strengthen our relationship with 
channel partners to provide our customers with better qual-
ity service.
As the leader of the Taiwanese telecom industry, it 
is the responsibility of the CHT to educate consum-
ers about using telecom equipment/services in an ef-
ficient way. To help smartphone customers make the 
most effective use of their mobile phones, we set up 
nine types of free Dr. mPro training courses on basic 
mobile phone usage and configuration, advanced and 
special features, mPro mobile briefcase and introduc-
tion to the Hami service. A total of 459 classes were 
taught with 7,979 students. Key Performance Indicators for the T ele-

Customer Service Quality
ImprovementInternet Support and 
Call Centers
Enterprise Customers
Reducing Contractor T urnoverWe are improving customer service quality by enhancing 
the collaboration between physical and virtual counters. 
By also setting up a coordination mechanism for handling 
complex cases, we can provide customers with a total 
service regardless of the customer type or service chan-
nel. Satisfaction surveys are also carried out at customer 
service centers on counters service, customer service hot-
lines and installation/repair services to improve the quality 
of service in a timely manner .For the customer convenience and the reduction of the 
travel time, we have expanded the scope of our service 
provided in the call centers and internet. For example, 
proof-of-payment can now be resent by just one click in the 
Internet support web site, and ‚ÄúHiNet KOD ‚Äù can be applied 
through just one call to the call centers. This is not only 
more convenient for the customer but also more environ-
mental friendly .
Introduced ‚ÄúON-site Customer Service Quality Survey ‚Äù 
in customer service centers to check the overall ser-
vice quality and verify the behavior of customer service 
representatives. 
Implemented the ‚ÄúInspiring Service ‚Äì Re-engineering 
Project ‚Äù to establish a set of quality service standards, 
improve the quality of counter service and instill the 
values of quality service into our corporate culture. 
Completed ‚ÄúSGS Qualicert‚Äù international service qual-
ity certification for all branch counters to maintain a 
high standard of service. 
Implemented automatic monitoring of counter waiting 
times and queue lengths. When the number of cus-
tomers in the queue exceeds a certain multiple of the 
available counters, the system automatically alerts the 
supervisor to assign more staff. Supervisors are also 
required to adopt management by walk about.
Upgraded the computerization of transaction systems 
and counters to more efficiently process applications 
and streamline the application process.Customers with an account manager: An account 
manager is assigned to key customers and high value 
SMEs as their contact window. We also offer enterprise 
customers with custom integrated data and communi-
cations service to help them reduce operating costs. 
Customers without an account manager: We provided 
discount bundles for each branch to promote through 
telephone marketing and customer information ses-
sions as necessary .
We have significantly reduced contractor turnover to 0.75% 
from 3.34% through the consolidation of the outsourcing 
standards for regional customer service contractors, the 
effective evaluation of contractor performance, and the 
adoption of reasonable fixed-price selective tenders. Even 
more, our outsourcing contractors also explicitly require 
the contract to conform to the Labor Standards Act and the 
Labor Safety & Health Act.After all regional customer service centers were consolidated under the Customer Service Department 
in 2007, CHT immediately began introducing international training and certification for customer service 
management in an effort. The move was intended to build the customer service team‚Äôs consensus on 
improving the quality of service and meet international customer service benchmarks. Professional cer-
tification training such as AQF (Australian Qualification Framework)) customer service management & 
management, customer communications and skill development were introduced in 2008. In 2009, the 
APCSC (Asia Pacific Customer Service Consortium Customer Service Analyst and Auditor certification 
were introduced between 2009 and 2010. We also introduced process improvements for ISO 9001 certi-
fication and set up a mystery shopper scheme to carry out self-audits from a customer perspective. The 
push for constant improvement is aimed at providing customers with more attentive and better quality 
service.Management Customer Service51
To find out how satisfied customers are with our services 
and their perception of our corporate image, brand value, 
and quality of service, we have commissioned an external 
market research firm every year to survey the customer 
satisfaction of general consumers, SMEs, and large enter -
prise customers. The surveys are aimed at identifying the 
key issues and expectations in each service and provide a 
guide for our future development.Customer Feedback Mechanism Customer Satisfaction Survey
The opinions of our customers are important to us and 
CHT has a 24-hour service window in place that customers 
can use to send us their feedback online, over the phone 
or through e-mails. We have also set up a CPS (Customer 
Opinion Process System) to pass customer feedback (in-
cluding complaints, praise and suggestions) directly to the 
relevant technical/service (e.g. line maintenance, product 
design/marketing, accounting), risk management and pub-
lic relations departments for response. The feedback is 
reviewed every month with customer service at a meeting 
chaired by the deputy general manager of the product sub-
sidiary .
Note: Satisfaction with each service is measured using the 5-point scale: 
Very satisfied, Satisfied, Average, Dissatisfied, These are represented 
by a score of 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively .‚ÄúFirst call resolution rate‚Äù refers to whether the customer service rep-
resentative was able to provide a complete service ‚Äúafter just one call‚Äù

Weather anomalies caused by climate change such as ris-
ing sea levels, drought and heavy rains will all affect the 
placement of telecom exchanges. Maintenance costs for 
telecom services will also increase significantly due to the 
added manpower required for emergency repairs and con-
sumer compensation. For this reason, we stepped up our 
education and awareness efforts in 2009 in the hopes of 
forming a ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù innovation chain that will help each 
region adapt to problems caused by climate change. 
CHT places a strong emphasis on disaster prevention and 
has emergency repairs teams standing by at all times to 
maintain communications in disaster areas. Our disaster 
prevention preparations include:Typhoon Morakot wreaked havoc on fixed networks and 
mobile phone base stations in parts of southern and 
central Taiwan. CHT immediately mobilized all available 
manpower and resources to make emergency repairs. The 
military was also called in to help transport technicians and 
satellite base station equipment by helicopter. Ultimately, 
a total of 43 sorties were Ô¨Çown, transporting 102 people, 
over 9,610 liters of fuel, 18 power generators and 8 sets of 
satellite communications equipment. 
At the same four-wheel-drive satellite trucks carrying por-
table satellite antenna, base station equipment, diesel 
generators, fuel and repair technicians advanced deep 
into the disaster areas such as Pingtung County ‚Äôs Linbian 
Township, Taitung County ‚Äôs Dawu and Taimali Townships, 
Kaohsiung County‚Äôs Namaxia Township, Jiaxiang Town-
ship, Taoyuan Township, Maolin Township as well as 
Baolai and Laonong in Liugui Township. The teams set up 
emergency satellite base stations and made emergency 
repairs to mobile phone base station. These efforts provide 
disaster rescue units and disaster victims with emergency 
communications that allowed them to ‚Äúmaintain contact ‚Äù.Disaster Preparations Maintaining Contact
Annual self-inspection in April each year the typhoon

Emergency Mobile Communications V ehicle Fleet
Due to the lessons of Typhoon Morakot CHT not only upgraded existing disaster prevention and response mechanisms 
but also invested $45 million into building a fully computerized operations platform, five emergency repair vehicles with 
heavy cross-road capability , winches and snorkels, satellite communications equipment and 36 sets of portable genera -
tors. The move signaled our determination to ensure that communications will be restored and maintained during future 
disasters so losses can be reduced to a minimum.Emergency Repair Principles for 
Telecommunications NetworksThe most touching moment for field technicians involved with emergency repairs for Typhoon Morakot 
was how ‚Äúwhen people finally got through on the mobile phone, both sides started crying. ‚Äù When a hur-
ricane strikes, CHT repair teams are immediately mobilized to restore communications to the disaster 
area.  For the repair team, ‚Äúrestore communications first‚Äù and ‚Äúaccomplishing the mission ‚Äù is the most 
important thing even if they have to bulldoze their way through or carry water pumps to Ô¨Çooded ex-
changes on a bamboo raft. The emergency repairs must also be carried out with zero accidents.Address Disaster Preparations

Chairman Lu surveyed the disaster area at Linbian early in 
the morning on August 10 accompanied by Deputy Gen-
eral Manager Hsieh from CHT South, Manager Su from 
the Pingtung branch and others. At the time, the route 
between the Linbian Fire Department and the Linbian 
Exchange was still under waist-high flood waters so the 
group could only proceed slowly by a telecom engineering 
truck. On the way back, they encountered an old woman 
who was trapped at home with no hot water for milk to 
feed her baby . Chairman Lu immediately gave up the front 
seat of the engineering truck to the old woman and joined 
the other employees on the truck bed piled high with tools 
and supplies. The compassion of CHT employees have 
become another heart-warming local story .On August 16, the Linkou-Zhongzhou fiber-optic cable

Network ManagementDisconnection Operations
Telephone Fraud AwarenessThe Fraud Disconnection Operations System (FDOS) was 
set up to refer suspicious phone activity to the police for 
investigation. Three customer service representatives are 
on average assigned each month to helping the police with 
immediately disconnecting suspicious phones to reduce 
the impact of telephone fraud on customers and the gen-
eral public.
More than 100,000 shifts were allocated to the various 
telephone fraud prevention tasks between 2004 and the 
end of 2009. Anti-fraud awareness information was also 
printed on over 1.78 billion account statements, sent 
through over 70 million SMS messages and over 340,000 
suspicious phone records turned over at the request of law 
enforcement. Total cost amounted to over NT$1.8 billion.We helped the government establish the 165 anti-fraud 
hotline in November , 2007. In 2009 an average of 15 cus-
tomer service representatives were assigned each month 
to assist the Criminal Investigation Bureau handle tier-1 
services between 8AM and 8PM weekdays. Key manage -
ment measures included:
Development of the automated communications record 
inquiry system (CRIS)
Encrypted call forwarding for fixed line exchanges.
Blocking of 30 telephone numbers belonging to govern -
ment and private organizations identified by the CIB as 
having been tampered with each day .
Screening of billing data to identify and block fixed lines 
suspected of having been hijacked. 
Caller ID screening service. 
Providing the ‚ÄúRetain 886 country code for international

SMS spoofing is where unethical overseas operators 
manipulate the sender address to send SMS fraud 
messages around the world through CHT network. 
Signal analysis is used by our system to check the 
actual position of overseas SMS senders. If spoofing 
is confirmed, the SMS center is immediately alerted to 
block the message and the victim‚Äôs account balance 
corrected.Communications Security
For network and communications security , CHT now offers 
the ‚ÄúHiNet OTP‚Äù and ‚ÄúCaller Blacklist ‚Äù services for our cus-
tomer‚Äôs protection. ‚ÄúHiNet OTP‚Äù uses a One Time Pass-
word randomly generated every 60 seconds that can be 
only used once to prevent hackers from hijacking accounts 
or fraud websites from stealing personal data. 
‚ÄúCaller Blacklist‚Äù allows the customer to blacklist a phone 
number they don‚Äôt want to take calls from. By default, 
these calls are automatically rejected by the system. Calls 
with hidden caller ID or an unidentifiable number are re-
directed to the voice mailbox instead, effectively protecting 
the customer against organized fraud groups or harass-
ment.
Privacy Protection Measures
All customer details at CHT are rated as ‚ÄúVery Confidential‚Äù 
and customer applications stored in locked file cabinets to 
prevent leaks and unauthorized access by customer ser-
vice representatives (including both CHT employees and 
contractors). All employees are required to sign a ‚ÄúConfi-
dentiality Agreement‚Äù and their direct superior required to 
take collective responsibility. For outsourced operations 
that involve the use of business secrets the contractor 
and its employees are also required to sign confidentiality 
agreements as well. Subsidiaries are required to report on 
their implementation of customer data protection each year 
while the head office and subsidiaries also conduct sur-
prise audits at service centers to ensure proper protection 
of consumer privacy .The right to privacy is a basic human right and a pillar of modern social order . Since the Computer-
Processed Personal Data Protection Act was introduced, CHT has maintained a comprehensive 
management system that makes use of advanced network technologies. CHT not only works close -
ly with government agencies to combat telephone fraud but is also protecting customer data from 
illegal theft and exploitation through international cooperation.ResponsePrivacy Protection and Combating

Compliance with National Standards
The World Health Organization (WHO) launched a 10-year 
international study at a cost of US$250 Million to study the 
effect of electromagnetic fields on public health in 1996. 
The results were published in Fact Sheet No. 304 by WHO 
in May, 2006, and concluded that ‚Äúconsidering the very 
low exposure levels and research results collected to date, 
there is no convincing scientific evidence that the weak RF 
signals from base stations and wireless networks cause 
adverse health effects‚Äù. There is therefore no cause for 
concern and the general public is free to enjoy the eco-
nomic benefits and convenience of mobile communica-
tions. 
As for the telecommunications industry, the regulatory 
authority in Taiwan has now set limits on the level of per-
missible EM radiation from base stations. All base stations 
must pass a technical review by the regulator before it may 
enter service. EM radiation should only be measured by 
trained experts using professional instruments. Measure-
ments taken by laymen or improper instruments (e.g. using 
low-frequency Gauss meter to measure high-frequency 
EM waves) increases the chance of invalid readings.
Electro Magnetic Fields: 
http://www .emfsite.org.tw/Community Communication
We have adopted a two-stage approach the communicat-
ing with the general public. Under normal circumstances, 
base stations are beautified and awareness programs run 
to explain their safety. In the event of a dispute, an inde-
pendent third-party agency is commissioned to take mea-
surements
Within CHT we emphasize the beautification of base sta-
tions to reduce their visual impact on the environment and 
the local people. Apart from beautifying the antennae of 
new base stations, we are also retro-fitting existing base 
stations as well. Decorations vary depending on the site 
and surroundings including painting, garden lights, vines 
and other special shapes. By the end of 2009 62% of all 
base station antennae have been beautified.
We partnered with the Taiwan Telecommunications In-
dustry Development Association to set up the ‚ÄúElectro 
Magnetic Fields‚Äù website to educate the general public 
about EM radiation. Members of the public that still have 
EM radiation concerns can submit an application to the 
free base station EM radiation measurement hotline (0800-
873888) jointly set up by CHT and other telcos, or request 
a meeting between CHT and the base station ‚Äôs stakehold -
ers. If they agree to have the EM radiation measured, we 
will commission an independent company to make on-site 
measurements. The results will be explained to the stake -
holders by experts. The resistance to base stations is now 
showing signs of improvement in 2009 with 158 appeals 
received from the general public, a decrease of 6% on 
2008.Mobile phone technology has now evolved from offering basic voice calls to delivering the latest mobile 
broadband communications. To provide our customers with the most advance and high quality mobile 
communications service, CHT has continued to build and optimize our core networks and base stations. 
Constant increases in wireless transmission rates has enabled an increasing number of wireless Internet 
and multimedia applications that require more bandwidth to run smoothly. The improvements have not 
only increased customer satisfaction but have spurred the development of many entertainment, industrial 
and commercial applications.ResponseElectromagnetic Radiation Decision-Making

Our Mission and W ork Approaches
The Chunghwa Telecom Foundation combines the core 
ability of the telecommunications industry and various so-
cial resources, to assist communities with development of 
the culture industry , to narrow the digital gap, and to culti-
vate lives in local communities. Local culture is the motif of 
our work, and community participation is the starting point 
of our services. We hope to contribute our efforts to com-
munity development in Taiwan. Our major work includes: 
The Chunghwa Telecom Foundation 
http://www .chtf.org.tw/
Click Taiwan
http://www .clicktaiwan.com.twThe foundation of the digital opportunities was laid by Chun-
ghwa Telecom‚Äôs employees who went deep into remote areas 
and shouldered most of the broadband installation tasks. With 
the backup of hardware facilities, we further donate products 
or services or provided other special offers. The Foundation 
and corporate volunteers also have dedicated themselves to 
educating the remote population. Besides our attention to the 
next generation‚Äôs growth, we also assist with development of 
the local culture industry, and we are concerned about the dis-
advantaged groups. With bottom-up and multi-faceted efforts, 
we hope to make Taiwan become a digital-inclusion society.To assist with the local culture industry: We construct 
the ‚ÄúClick Taiwan‚Äù website, offering the local community 
industry a platform for information exchange. We hope 
that through words, images and videos, we can keep a 
record of their efforts and stories in local communities 
together .
To narrow the digital gap: We narrow the digital gap 
by establishing the Digital Good Neighbor project in 
remote areas and tribal villages. Besides installing fa-
cilities and the broadband Internet, we introduce social 
resources and corporate volunteers to improve the 
quality of life, education, and industry in the communi -
ties.
To cultivate lives in local communities: We continue to 
care about and engage in the communities. Through 
providing various volunteer services, we help commu-
nities with their sustainable development.To fulfill the promise of creating digital opportunities, Chunghwa Telecom officially founded the Chunghwa 
Telecom Foundation in 2006 and passed the Foundation bylaw . The Digital Opportunities Group was es-
tablished under the CSR Committee, committing itself to promoting projects on narrowing the digital gap.

TQC Computer CertiÔ¨Åcate Courses Make Good Use and Do Good
The ideal of the Digital Good Neighbor is that letting every -
one ‚Äúmake good use‚Äù of computers and ‚Äúdo good ‚Äù through 
computers; everyone can ‚Äúmake good use‚Äù of the Internet, 
and ‚Äúdo good ‚Äù through the Internet; the ultimate goal is to 
make everyone ‚Äúmake good use‚Äù of opportunities, and ‚Äúdo 
good ‚Äù through the Internet. 
This ideal came from reflection upon years of practices. 
We found that to narrow the digital gap is not to simply give 
away computers or deploy the Internet. If there is a lack in 
proper guidance from the surroundings, the next genera-
tion might use the Internet wrongly and cause more social 
problems.
In addition, the digital gap does not only exist between the 
urban and the rural. There are one million people in New 
Taipei City solely who are computer illiterate. The digital 
gap in the urban area is a miniature of that in Taiwan. 
‚ÄúDo not fail to do good even if it‚Äôs small; do not engage in 
evil even if it‚Äôs small. ‚Äù The Chunghwa Telecom Foundation 
continues to deepen and cultivate the power of technology , 
making it well applied on creating social welfare.‚ÄúIn order to tangibly evaluate the effects of promoting 
digital opportunities, and practice the idea of making 
good use of computers and making them do good,‚Äù we 
started to assist people in remote areas with acquiring 
the TQC computer certificate courses, and meanwhile, 
we could ensure their learning effects. There have been 
135 people taking the test, and 100 have passed. The 
passing rate was 74%. 
We also have provided computer-related courses for 
1,023 hours, helping people in remote areas to make 
use of resources on the Internet. In 2010, we will intro-
duce computer courses that reinforce the application on 
daily life, and will keep promoting the TQC certificate 
test.
Computer Courses for New Residents
The new resident mother in Jingliao Village in Tainan 
County takes computer courses under the Digital 
Good Neighbor Project on Tuesdays and Thursdays.We started the project ‚ÄúDigital Good Neighbor ‚Äù in 2006. Together with 24,000 employees across the na-
tion, we worked on fulfilling the corporate promise of creating digital opportunities. By the end of 2009, 
we have established 43 Digital Good Neighbors, and donated 658 computers and 355 sets of software 
equipment to remote areas and tribal villages. We introduced the service provided by our corporate vol-
unteers and various resources to communities according to their specific needs.Address Digital Good Neighbor62
Common Satellite Shared Discs 
Project Investment on the InfrastructureWe have worked on the long-term policy objective that citizens are guaranteed with their basic rights 
to telecommunications and that they have fair and wide access to telecom services. At present, the 
house- hold penetration rate for fixed line telephone services in Taiwan is 96.8%. We have provided over 
220,000households with telephone services and more than 30,000 households with data communication 
services in over 81 remote and economically deprived areas; over 19,000 sets of public telephones in 25 
administrative districts; more than 3,700 primary and high schools and public libraries with data commu -
nication services. In 2009, Chunghwa Telecom spent a total of NT$978 million on the widely-accessible 
services.Response Universal T elecom Services
Broadband Access to T ribal 
Villages
We actively assisted the National Communications Com-
mission (NCC) with the policy on the universal telecom 
services, so that we provided residents in remote areas 
with the broadband network and narrowed the digital gap 
between the urban and the rural. In 2007, we constructed 
broadband infrastructure in 43 villages among 46 (93.5%) 
under the project ‚ÄúBroadband for Villages.‚Äù In 2008, we 
constructed broadband infrastructure in 42 villages among 
50 (84%) under the project ‚ÄúBroadband for Tribes ‚Äù. 
At the ‚ÄúUniversal Services and Civic Participation‚Äù award 
ceremony for the third anniversary of NCC‚Äôs foundation, 
we won four prizes in total: ‚ÄúTelecom Universal Service 
Award - Best Customer Care Award,‚Äù ‚ÄúTelecom Universal 
Service Award - Best Construction Award,‚Äù ‚ÄúTelecom Uni-
versal Service Award - Best Access Service Promotion 
Award,‚Äù ‚ÄúTelecom Universal Service Award - Best Volun-
teer Award. ‚Äù
In 2009, NCC continued to promote construction of broad -
band infrastructure in 51 tribal villages. In order to well 
take corporate responsibility , we were responsible for more 
than 90% of them, which accounted for 48 villages in total, 
distributed across 12 counties.Commissioned by the Council of Indigenous Peoples, Ex-
ecutive Yuan, we have constructed a direct satellite broad -
cast system to improve the TV signal reception in tribal 
villages since 2004. By the end of 2009, we have installed 
the system in 71,228 households.Responding to the government ‚Äôs promotion of major public 
investments, we expect ourselves to facilitate development 
of the industries and generate the most economic benefits, 
by taking advantage of our core ICT ability. The govern-
ment plans that the coverage rate of broadband (>30Mbps) 
will reach 80% by 2012. However , by the end of 2009, the 
broadband coverage rate already reached 73%, so that 
the policy objective will be achieved successfully . In 2009, 
Taiwan ‚Äôs FTTB penetration rate by households was ranked 
the fourth worldwide, only next to Korea, Hong Kong and 
Japan.
Due to rapid growth in the broadband internet in the Asia-
Pacific region, we continue to expand the capacity of cur-
rent undersea cables and engage ourselves in establishing 
new undersea cable systems, to satisfy the need of cor-
porate customers for increasing bandwidth. In May 2009, 
we announced the cooperation with major telecom com-
panies in the Asia-Pacific Region in constructing the new 
undersea cable in East Asia ‚ÄúAsia-Pacific Gateway ‚Äù (APG), 
which is estimated to be completed and launched in 201 1.

Reading Companions for 
Disaster-Affected ChildrenFrom the Digital Opportunity to the 
Cloud Computing Services
To nurture children ‚Äôs heart through reading, the Chunghwa 
Telecom Foundation picked and gave 300 psychologi-
cal healing picture books to children in Jialutang Military 
Camp in Fangshan Township, Fongshan Military Academy , 
Fongshiung Military Camp and Jingling Military Camp in 
Yenchao Township, and Renmei Military Camp in Dashu 
Township, Dahsin Elementary School in Jiadong Town-
ship, and Hengchun Christian Hospital in Pingtung. During 
September and October , the Chunghwa Telecom Founda -
tion also worked with the Hengchun Christian Hospital on 
a ‚ÄúMobile Book Wagon‚Äù project: we went to the Jialutang 
Miliary Camp for two days, with one volunteer accompany -
ing the children to read there.After years of promoting digital opportunities, we have real-
ized that the digital gap is not simply a gap in facilities, but 
a gap in abilities to make use of information. For individu -
als, the ability to read serves as the base of using various 
internet services. For the whole society, the general pub-
lic‚Äôs ability to apply information is the base of developing 
new industries such as the cloud computing. So our long-
term goal is to develop better social soil as the base and 
cultivate every digital opportunity. We hope to make Taiwan 
a genuine benchmark for information
Read First and You Can Surf the Internet
In the Digital Good Neighbor in Xidiyao in Nantou, 
children have to read first for 30 minutes before they 
use the computer. It is because we are convinced that 
a habit to read formed in the childhood will enable 
these children to better use the power of technology 
in the future.
We are aware that the key to creating digital opportunities is to cultivate the digital character of the next 
generation. Facing the virtual world that computers and the Internet create together, adults are not the 
only one that needs to tell the basic difference between ¬®use them well¬© and ¬®use them poorly;¬© it is 
the next generation that needs an opportunity to learn how to correctly use the Internet. This is what chal-
lenges the Chunghwa Telecom Foundation the most, as well as where the importance of corporate social 
responsibility lies.Target Digital Character64

more important. In 2009, we divided social contribution 
into three categories: charitable donations, community 
investment, and business advocacy, in the hope that we 
can strengthen communication with internal and external 
stakeholders with transparency .After Typhoon Morakot stroke Taiwan, we immediately 
announced¬®a corporate donation of NT$20 million for

munications facilities for the W orld Games in Kaohsiung and the DeÔ¨Çympics in Taipei; 3. Intensification of 
the accounting management of CSR information, with a detailed list of donation in terms of products and 
services.Management
 Management of social contribution66
To ensure clear communications in the devastated area 
and meanwhile subsidize the victims, we provided more 
temporary jobs for them by hiring the aboriginal youth to 
support the work on saving base stations and transporting 
the necessities. Our work covered these areas: Laiji in Mt 
Ali, Lijia, Yuntan in Meishan, Changshu Lake, Liuguei in 
Kaohsiung, Taoyuan, Namasia, and Wutai in Pingtung. The 
total of the pay cheques was more than NT$480,000, and 
more than 600 aboriginal youth were therefore benefited.To show our concerns for customers in the devastated 
area, we provided various special offers on telecom servic -
es fees, including a discount on the monthly cost and the 
calling feefree replacement of a new SIM card, the cable 
modems, and the set-top-box, and etc.To assist the official settlement center and other civil 
groups with relief, we provided 90 mobile phone, 54 satel -
lite phones, 253 telephones, 168 public phones, and 75 
broadband Internet accesses, 22 dedicated lines and 16 
MOD accesses.
To help villagers in the shelters in Nantou, Chiayi, Fong-
shan and Taidong to surf the Internet, 108 corporate volun -
teers provided the service. The accumulated service time 
was 633 hours.
Increasing Job OpportunitiesSpecial Offers of T elecom Services 
for the T yphoon-AffectedFree Communication Facilities and 
Corporate V olunteer ServiceAssisting the Government with 
Reconstruction
Marketing agricultural produces in 
disastrous areasWe assisted the Morakot Post-Disaster Reconstruction 
Council with the construction of permanent houses, instal -
lation of telecommunications channels, the Internet, copper 
cables, optical cables, MSAN devices, to provide services 
of local calls, broadband, and MOD. We spent approxi-
mately NT$16 million in Yuemei Farm in Shanlin Township, 
and about NT$13 million in Majia Farm in Majia Township. 
We continue to pay attention to the development of the 
industry in the devastated areas. In order to provide proper 
space for business, we started to convert the operation 
offices in Fongshan, Chiayi, Pingtung and Taitung into the 
Chunghwa Telecom Passing-the-Love Markets. Farmers 
in Mingzu Village in Namasia Township and Siaolin Village 
in Jiasian Township in Kaohsiung, Jinfong Township in Tai-
tung, which are the most severely damaged, were invited 
to sell their agricultural products here. Our employees and 
customers were therefore provided with an opportunity to 
show their concerns for the victims.
The T ribal Handcraft Classroom
The tribal handcraft teachers from the Minzu Village 
in the Namasia Township were busy collecting weav -
ing materials after arriving in the shelter and taught 
tribal women to weave, to distract their attention from 
the disaster. They were encouraged to weave their 
love for the lost family and home into their works. 
Such works are also available in the Passing-the-love 
Market.Typhoon Morakot devastated the eastern and southern areas  in Taiwan.  We by all means  helped with the 
government ‚Äôs rescue, relief and settlement work and tried to figure out how to make most of the coopera -
tion of the public and private sectors to accompany the victims on the road of reconstruction.Address Reconstruction after T yphoon Morakot67
In December 2009, the Virtual Elementary School, 
the experiential project that the Chunghwa Telecom 
Foundation practiced in the Majia Township, Ping-
tung County, officially started the E-Tutoring for 
School Children in the Typhoon Morakot Devastated 
Areas Project. We will continue to look for proper 
locations and partners in the devastated areas, in 
order to help more affected school children.  Fund-
ing of this project will be provided from the corporate 
donation of NT$20 million for typhoon relief that we 
publicly announced.Our idea about education is to provide the most needed 
with the best. Lesson designs that are one-on-one on-line 
and customized can better fit the needs of students. There-
fore, it is more efficient than asking a teacher to come all 
the way here and teach quite a few students at one time. 
We solved problems like the unstable Internet and low 
transmission rate. The group from the Fu Jen Catholic Uni-
versity was responsible for selection of volunteer tutors. 
Compared with traditional tutoring, what one-on-one e-
tutoring requires are more than computers on both the 
teacher and the student sides. To facilitate on-line interac -
tion between the teacher and student, software equipment 
and hardware equipment like a web camera, a pentop 
computer, and handwritten Ô¨Çashcards are also necessary. 
Thus, a set of facilities can cost as much as NT$35,000. 
However , it is worth it to see children ‚Äôs serious attitudes to-
wards learning and their facial expressions while interact-
ing with the teachers.Continuous Projects Advantages of E-tutoring
E-Tutoring Framework
Our online tutoring environment is divided into teach -
ing end and learning end. Each has a personalized 
equipment to facilitate one-on-one distance learning.aIn the process of company , we gradually figured out the approach to support the long-term reconstruc -
tion in the devastated areas. We think the key is to improve the education environment for children who 
are now doubly disadvantaged. W e started to cooperate with the Fu Jen Catholic University in May 2008, 
working on the E-Tutoring Project for School Children in Remote Areas. Enough experiences have been 
accumulated ever since, and it is officially changed into the E-Tutoring Project for School Children in the 
Devastated Areas.AddressE-tutoring Projects for School Children in the

The Public-Help-Search System
Toll-Free Numbers and Public SMS 
ServicesGMDSS
Low-income households and 
Disadvantaged Groups‚ÄúThe Public-Help-Search System‚Äù invented by the Tele-
communications Laboratories was provided with one-year 
free trial for charities such as the Child Welfare League 
Foundation and the Seeks Association Center of the Fed-
eration for the Welfare of the Elderly . Through approaches 
such as MOD, HiNet, Hichannel, emome, Xuite, e-bills, 
greeting letters to customers, and mobile DM, we deliver 
messages of help-search volunteer recruitment. At the ear-
ly stage we would recruit mobile phone users of Chunghwa 
Telecom to join this project, hoping to make use of MMS to 
expand the broadcast. It requires more attention for miss-
ing children, teenagers and seniors to find their way home.
The Public-Help-Search System
 https://mfind.echt.com.tw
We provide various toll-free numbers (local telephone and 
mobile), such as 110 (police), 113 (children and women 
protection), 118 (coastline crime reporting), 119 (fire), 
165 (antifraud inquiry), 1922 (national epidemic situation 
report), and 1957 (assistance), a total of eight numbers. 
Besides, we also send SMS messages to assist the gov-
ernment in promoting policies and orders. In 2009, the ac-
cumulated fees reached to almost NT$99.44 million.Our coastal radio stations, in coordination with the national 
policies as well as rules of the international organizations, 
are assigned by the Ministry of Transportation and Com-
munications to deploy a communications service called 
‚ÄúGlobal Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).‚Äù 
The service provides local and foreign vessels in our sea 
regions with free information on communications with the 
land in case of emergencies, navigation safety, rescue 
plan, and international news. The service is also respon-
sible for the communication work in case of any dangers 
or accidents on the sea. The Ministry of Transportation and 
Communications allocated a NT$ 38.95 million subsidy 
grant for this service. Our actual business expenditure was 
approximately NT$100.491 million. In 2009, 136 emergen -
cy radio transmissions were deployed. Out of 136 emer-
gency radio transmissions deployed, there were 51 ship-
wrecks in particular and 264 people were rescued. There 
were also 46,135 DSC safety calls and 165,378 times of 
navigation warning telex (NA VTEX) were issued.
For low-income households and the disadvantaged groups 
like the physically and mentally challenged, we provide 
various discount plans on the broadband Internet and 
phone cards, to help them enjoy high-performance telecom 
services with low charge.

Barrier-free DeaÔ¨Çympics Obstruction-free W orld Games
While Chunghwa Telecom helped with planning the ‚ÄúWorld 
Deaf Swimming Championships ‚Äù and the ‚ÄúTaipei Invitation -
al Games for the Deaf ‚Äù in 2007 and 2008 respectively , we 
already started to consider telecom-relevant services that 
the hearing impaired would need. All of our efforts paid off 
while we sponsored the 2009 DeaÔ¨Çympics in Taipei.
The 2009 DeaÔ¨Çympics in Taipei was the first time for the 
DeaÔ¨Çympics to happen in an Asian city. We were well pre-
pared for what could facilitate the information communica -
tion for the hearing impaired by taking care of aspects like 
services, technology and businesses. Besides, we had 
customized plans with special offers such as the video-
phone.
In the outdoor MOD live broadcasting of the open ceremo -
ny, we added the service of instruction in sign language. 
Therefore, all of the hearing impaired could have a good 
grasp of the games and felt the stirring atmosphere.Responding to the M-Taiwan Project hosted by the Indus -
trial Development Bureau, Ministry of Economic Affairs, we 
made investments of over NT$300 million, completed 25 
WiMAX base stations and provided WiMAX services dur-
ing the time the W orld Games were held.
In addition to the wireless broadband Internet provided for 
citizens, we also provided wireless services such as the 
mobile remote monitor, the mobile navigator, the value-
added broadband platform, and the ITS. 
Because of the wireless services of Chunghwa Telecom, 
the World Games in Kaohsiung showed a different per-
spective to all: reporters could submit their coverage any-
time; referees and athletes could check up the games any 
time; taxi services were available through the information 
dispatch system; the audience could watch games on their 
mobile phone, computer , and the new media-MOD.
Dream without Limits, and Shine 
around the W orld
Chunghwa Telecom has sponsored the tennis player 
Yen-Hsun Lu since 2009 as a good companion for 
the top athletes who pursue their dreams around the 
world. Besides, we also sponsored cyclists Po-Hung 
Wu, Ting-Yin Huang and the Chunghwa Telecom 
Women ‚Äôs Basketball Team.A thoughtful communication design can strengthen communication between specific communities and society, and 
improving the quality of life is one of the corporate social responsibilities of the telecommunications industry; we 
sponsor great games with state-of-the-art technology, to broaden the horizons of the general public and stretch the 
imagination of future urban life.Target Developing Products for Special Needs70The Chunghwa Telecom Foundation started to promote 
the Digital Good Neighbor Project four years ago. Directed 
by Pastor Chiu-An Wu from the Presbyterian Church, the 
computer lab in Jingliao, Houbi Township, has been rather 
outstanding. It is the power recharge station in the eyes of 
the new residents. 
Because there were courses of webpage design and 
multimedia editing, students in the after school in Jingliao 
were accustomed to using their camera to keep a record 
of everything around them with their specific perspective. 
When Typhoon Morakot hit Taiwan, Bajang River overÔ¨Çew 
the embankment and flooded the computer lab. The first 
thing these children did afterwards was to take pictures of 
the aftermath and uploaded them to the website of Click 
Taiwan of Chunghwa Telecom. ‚ÄúAfter these children grow 
up, my dream will not be far away ,‚Äù said Pastor W u.‚ÄúOne of my biggest dreams is that one day farmers in Jingliao will sell their agriculture produces online without being 
exploited by businessmen.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhen anything emergency happens in the future world, the Internet world will play a more and more important role. Our 
dream is to connect the Internet world and the actual world.‚ÄùListen to Their Stories 1

In 2009 Chunghwa Telecom gave it a new try: We 
financially supported 20 students from the Chengchi  
University to engage 10 Digital Good Neighbors. They 
chose community industries or special communities 
that have a local character or full of cultural heritage. 
They kept a record of their stories with documentaries, 
expecting to put together a picture with local Taiwanese 
lives and the humanities. More stories on Click Taiwan:

A group of young people who built the relationships with 
Chunghwa Telecom in 2008 because of the ‚ÄúPuncar Ac-
tion,‚Äù started to establish the Typhoon Morakot Online 
Disaster Report Center during the early hours of the morn -
ing on August 9th. They integrated disaster reports of all 
sources through Twitter and Plurk in the hope of filtering 
information for rescue assistance and relief. 
Similarly, the Chunghwa Telecom Foundation actively 
provided assistance at the first possible time. Besides 
coordinating the Research, Development and Evaluation 
Commission to borrow 40 3.5G USB modems, it also pro-
vided the Center with unlimited bandwidth and facilities. 
The Center therefore had enough strength to become the 
emergency operations center on the Internet during the 
most difficult two weeks for rescue.  
‚ÄúWe appreciate Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs help, so that an 
Otaku person can become a rescue hero,‚Äù said Ting-Yao 
Hsu, Chair of the Association of Digital Culture.Puncar Action
In 2008, three young men and a second-hand micro-
bus together created the ‚ÄúPuncar Action.‚Äù They made 
known of the idea ‚Äúdelivering an Otaku person to a 
remote village to teach computer courses,‚Äù and was 
awarded the ‚ÄúDigital Community Award‚Äù at the Austrian 
Digital Arts Festival. Their first piece of sponsorship was 
from the Chunghwa Telecom Foundation.
