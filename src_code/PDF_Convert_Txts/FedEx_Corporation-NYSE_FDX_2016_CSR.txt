FedEx enterprise-wide strategies, goals, 
programs and progress across three key 
pillars: Economy, Environment and People. 
Data in this report covers each of our 
operating companies and all geographies in our 2016 fiscal year, which ended May 
31, 2016, unless otherwise noted.Because TNT Express was acquired late in 
fiscal year 2016, that entity is not included 
in any of the reported data.

WHAT CONNECTS 
US MAKES US 
STRONGER
Few companies have the privilege of 
participating in the world at large like we 
do at FedEx. From holiday e-commerce 
packages to global supply chain solutions to disaster relief, we’re fortunate to be part of millions of lives and thousands of communities. 
From our vantage point, we see 
firsthand how the world works. Without 
question, we realize the interests of our communities, our workplaces, and the 
planet are intertwined. Our future depends 
on recognizing and balancing those needs in everything we do across our business. 
This is equally important to our customers, 
investors, and team members. In fact, $6.7 billion in FY16 revenue came from 
customers who wanted to know more 
about the emissions generated from shipping their goods.
 
Commerce adds jobs to 
communities
Our business-to-business, business-to-
consumer, and e-commerce solutions 
benefit more customers than ever, helping 
them to prosper and their communities to flourish. Today, just about anyone with 
a mobile phone can reach new markets almost instantly. At FedEx, our services physically connect customers to the 
digital economy, creating more jobs and improving lives.
Here’s an example from the brother-and-
sister team that founded ArtLifting three years ago. Through e-commerce propelled 
by FedEx, the small Boston business sells 
paintings and prints from more than 100 
homeless and disabled artists to buyers 
throughout the U.S. and around the world. These artists receive more than half the 
sales from their works, not to mention a 
big boost in pride and confidence. It’s a brilliant business strategy that also betters 
the lives of underserved people.
Stories like this demonstrate the power of 
trade to create new markets and greater 
opportunities. In fact, 7 in 10 U.S. small businesses see global trade as improving the U.S. economy, according to the FedEx 
Trade Index, a 2016 survey conducted by 
Morning Consult. Trade is our business, and we’re proud that FedEx jobs are trade 
jobs. Of course, we’re not unique — about 
40 million jobs in the U.S. are directly related to trade.
Sustainability reduces our 
environmental footprint
As trade connects the world and 
enhances prosperity, we understand 
that how we connect the world matters. 
By incorporating sustainability efforts throughout our global network, we’re 
reducing the environmental footprint of 
commerce. Since 2008, we’ve saved more than 158 million gallons of vehicle fuel 
by replacing vehicles with more efficient 
models and making greater use of electric 
vehicles, fuel cells, natural gas, hybrids 
and clean truck technologies. In FY15, five years ahead of target, we met our goal of increasing FedEx Express vehicle fuel efficiency by 30 percent 
from a 2005 baseline. We’ve now set a 
new goal. By 2025, we want to increase vehicle fuel efficiency by 50 percent from 
a 2005 baseline, or 17 percent from a 
2015 baseline. In FY16, we saved more than 153 million gallons of jet fuel by 
continuing to modernize our aviation 
fleet and improve operations. As a result, we avoided the equivalent of almost 1 .5 
million metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions. 
Safety makes our 
communities better places 
to live
At the same time we set and meet our 
sustainability goals, we are focused on Chairman's Letter
Without question, we 
realize the interests of our communities, our workplaces, and the planet are intertwined. Our future depends on recognizing and balancing those needs in 
everything we do across our 
business."
Frederick W. Smith
Chairman and CEO
2017 FedEx Global Citizenship Report4Our Company Economy Environment People GRI
safety — our No. 1 priority. Ensuring 
the safety of the people in our global 
network — along with our customers and 
communities — is a complex job. But it’s one we take extremely seriously. Like 
sustainability, we integrate safety into 
everything we do, and we share our safety expertise with communities around the 
world.
In cities from Mexico City to Mumbai, 
we’re working with EMBARQ, part of the World Resources Institute’s Ross Center for Sustainable Cities, to develop safe 
and sustainable transport and planning 
solutions. EMBARQ adapted the FedEx Safety First manual to train 1,150 public 
transportation drivers in three Mexico 
cities. As a result of the training, more than 1 .2 million passengers a day benefit 
from safer bus systems. 
The FedEx team shares 
expertise to change lives 
Our community investment strategy 
is simple: We do what we do best for 
those in need. That includes sharing our 
knowledge and resources in collaboration with trusted non-governmental and non-profit organizations to tackle 
some of society’s biggest problems in 
communities where we live and work. In FY16, the first year of our commitment 
to invest $200 million in more than 200 
global communities by 2020, we invested more than $46 million in charitable 
contributions, benefiting 97 communities 
around the world. Team members came out in force, contributing more than $9 
million during our United Way campaign, Chairman's Letter
Frederick W. Smith
Chairman and CEOand volunteering more than 93,000 hours 
in more than 500 cities worldwide. 
I thank the FedEx team, more than 
400,000 people strong, for working every 
day to make the world a better place. 
From couriers to customer service reps, from package handlers to pilots, each 
team member plays a role in delivering on 
our commitments — to our customers, our communities, and our planet. We 
firmly believe that what connects us 
makes us stronger.

MATERIALITY AND RISK ASSESSMENT
FedEx conducts regular corporate social 
responsibility materiality assessments, which inform our citizenship approach, goals, targets and metrics, covering environmental, social and governance 
topics. We also seek wide-ranging input 
from external and internal stakeholders through workshops, interviews and 
surveys on our approach and programs.
We updated our latest CSR materiality 
analysis in FY16, as we sought feedback from stakeholders through a survey and 
roundtable engagement session with 
industry groups, customers, investors, 
sustainability experts, nonprofits and government agencies. This will assist us 
in modifying our materiality matrix in the 
future.
For more details about our CSR materiality 
process please refer to page 7 of the FedEx 2014 Global Citizenship Report.
Mitigating citizenship risks 
Our understanding of the key issues that impact our business enables us to 
manage associated risks, and capitalize 
on potential opportunities. We plan for the long-term across our operations to 
mitigate potential negative impacts on our revenue, costs, reputation and business 
continuity. 
The FedEx Board of Directors, supported 
by management, oversees all risk 
management activities. For information on 
these responsibilities, please see our 2016 Proxy Statement.

harassment and discrimination, conflicts of interest and gifts and entertainment. 
We encourage reporting of all suspected 
violations using our 24-hour FedEx Alert Line service or through management, 
legal or human resources. FedEx complies with all anti-corruption 
laws, and prohibits bribes of any type.

to customers with the least impact as possible, while ensuring team member 
safety — our top priority.  
To support our internal process, FedEx 
participates in State Emergency Operations Centers programs, as well as 
the FEMA-Northern Command Public-

together with national, state and local 
emergency management organizations 
to work collaboratively before, during and

BUSINESSPERFORMANCE
Our business strategy is shaped by these 
four key trends driving global commerce:
• Growth of e-commerce
• Globalization of trade
• Faster, more efficient supply chains
• Influx of high-tech businesses and  
high-value-added goods 
We make investments that align our business with these trends, including transformative acquisitions. We enhance 
our financial performance by extending 
our global portfolio and reach. Our FY16 acquisition of TNT Express — the largest 
acquisition in our history — significantly 
expands our footprint in Europe. The earlier acquisitions of GENCO (now FedEx 
Supply Chain) and Bongo International 
(now FedEx Cross Border) in FY15 strengthened our global offerings by 
improving our reverse logistics networks 
and simplifying international transactions, respectively.
In FY16, FedEx revenues exceeded $50

ECONOMICIMPACT
Online commerce has revolutionized the 
way the world conducts business and 
changed the global retail landscape. With a 
click, customers and companies large and small have access to global markets once unattainable, creating opportunities and 
growing economies.
FedEx is at the heart of global economic 
connections. We use our extensive, 
reliable and efficient logistics network to enable our customers almost everywhere 
access to international markets. We 
provide services and support that make it easier for small businesses 
to compete, reach new markets and 
navigate regulatory red tape. And we advocate for removing barriers to trade 
and streamlining global trade regulations 
in ways that expand market access for our customers, improve the efficiency of 
goods movement and generate economic 
growth.Delivering global 
e-commerce growth
E-commerce currently accounts for 
almost $2 trillion in sales worldwide, 
and is expected to top $2.4 trillion by 
2018. FedEx sits at the center of this e-commerce transformation. Our flexible 
global logistics model and transportation 
network seamlessly connects 220 countries and territories, enabling us to affordably deliver purchased items to 
nearly any person or business quickly, 
efficiently and responsibly. To keep pace with e-commerce growth and intensifying 
customer demand, in FY16 we invested 
heavily in expanding our network capacity and portfolio of solutions.
In May 2016, we acquired TNT Express, 
a Dutch delivery company specializing 
in international express and freight 
transportation and small-package ground delivery. Our largest acquisition to date 
significantly expands our global portfolio 
and strategic reach, particularly in Europe. The integration of TNT Express will further 
increase the productivity and efficiency 
of our global operations, and expand our opportunities to profit from global market 
trends, including e-commerce. 
FedEx Supply Chain, formerly GENCO, 
a leading North American third-party 
logistics provider and pioneer of retail reverse logistics since the early 1990s, 
is enhancing our e-commerce portfolio 
by transforming the way we manage customer returns. Through an integrated 
suite of supply chain solutions, we enable 
consumer brands and retailers of all sizes to focus on growing business and 
exceeding customer expectations.
FedEx Cross Border, formerly Bongo 
International, expanded its services to China and Japan. The company is a leader 
in cross-border facilitation technologies 
and solutions that offer a seamless, integrated check-out process and delivery 
system. FedEx Cross Border has also established a digital supply chain strategy for small- and medium-sized business-
to-business and business-to-consumer e-commerce companies, allowing them 
to be competitive and cost-efficient in the 
global marketplace. 
FedEx Ground invested $1 .6 billion to 
better manage forecasted e-commerce growth, illustrated by a 9 percent 
increase in ground package volume 
in FY16. Investments included new automated hubs in Florida and California, and automated stations in 19 additional 
markets. This brings the total number of 
automated hubs to 35 and automated stations to 68, furthering the ability to sort 
packages more quickly, efficiently and cost 
effectively.

to the global marketplace, but provides the regulatory, logistics and supply chain 
know-how they need to succeed. 
The FedEx

2017 FedEx Global Citizenship Report17OUR GLOBAL
SUPPLY CHAIN
Our business success depends on a 
complex, global supply chain to provide 
the resources and services needed to run 
our business smoothly and meet growing customer needs. Our major suppliers 
include equipment manufacturers, fuel 
companies and transportation service providers. We work closely with vendors 
to proactively mitigate risks to our 
business from extended supply chains.
Risk mitigation 
FedEx is alert to the operational and reputational risks inherent in working 
with a large, diverse and far-flung set 
of suppliers. Across our business, we 
work proactively to identify and manage 
critical supply chain risks through robust, enterprise-wide policies and procedures. 
We mitigate the most significant risks 
by focusing on those suppliers critically dependent to our business success. 
Our Sourcing Organization’s Supplier 
Relationship Management team also leads collaborative efforts to improve 
the sustainability practices of critically 
dependent suppliers.FedEx expects suppliers will aspire to uphold the principles in our Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics and other 
corporate social responsibility policy statements. As a founding member 
of the U.S. Sustainable Purchasing 
Leadership Council, we participate in Technical Advisory Groups and apply best 
practice guidance to our own supply chain 
sustainability initiatives.
In requests for new business, FedEx 
includes supplier sustainability risk-screening criteria to evaluate new and 
potential general suppliers. Sustainability 
screening criteria address performance in environmental, social, labor and human 
rights areas, including child and forced 
labor. 
We look to continually build on our 
performance in this area, increasing by 30 percent year-over-year the number of 
supplier screening events that effectively 
evaluate potential global suppliers for their sustainability performance.In addition to new supplier screening events, our sourcing team regularly scores 
existing critically dependent suppliers 
on issues that evaluate their overall performance, including sustainability 
metrics. We share results with the 
supplier and work with them in areas 
where improvements need to be made, if 
necessary.
30%In FY16, we increased the number of supplier screening 
events that included sustainability assessment criteria by more than 30 percent compared with FY15.

2017 FedEx Global Citizenship Report18Our diverse supplier base 
For more than two decades, FedEx has 
proactively sourced products and services 
from small, minority- and women-owned 
businesses across our supply chain. In FY16, we procured $9.2 billion in goods 
and services from diverse suppliers, a 37 
percent increase from FY15. The growth reflects an overall increase in supplier 
spend across the enterprise, and internal 
policies focused on diverse supplier spend. 
The FedEx Services Sourcing Organization 
manages our enterprise-wide Supplier Diversity program, aligning efforts to 
increase procurement spend with diverse 
suppliers globally. In the United States, we collaborate with national and regional diversity organizations to promote the growth 
of small and diverse businesses and to 
increase opportunities for FedEx to work with these enterprises. In the last fiscal 
year, we collaborated with the Women’s 
Business Enterprise National Council, the National Minority Supplier Development 
Council, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of 
Commerce, the National Veteran-Owned Business Association, the National Gay & 
Lesbian Chamber of Commerce and the 
Small Business Administration, among others. In FY16, we hosted the first FedEx Shared Services Supplier Conference in Memphis, engaging more than 100 key suppliers. 
The event focused on providing suppliers 
with a deeper understanding of FedEx and enabling them to better connect 
their value proposition to ours. FedEx 
leadership shared valuable insights with suppliers on a wide array of topics that 
included managing supplier diversity and 
sustainability.

main operating activity. Our efforts 
to decouple business growth from emission increases focuses on improving 
efficiencies in our vehicle and aircraft 
fleets and buildings, providing alternative solutions for customers, working to discover new technologies for our assets, 
and advocating for sound public policy. 
We are piloting new technologies such as low-emission surface vehicles and planned 
alternative jet fuels. We are proud of our 
progress to date and will continue to pursue these challenging goals.FY16 performance
Our aircraft fleet has achieved a 22 percent reduction in emissions intensity 
since 2005, continuing toward our goal 
of a 30 percent reduction by 2020. In FY16, our FedEx Express surface vehicle

meeting our 2020 goal five years early.
Our business continued to grow in  
FY16 — consolidated revenue increased 
by 6 percent, average daily package volumes at FedEx Express and FedEx 
Ground increased by 6 percent and FedEx 
Freight less-than-truckload (LTL) volume increased by more than 3%. However, 
our scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions

models. These two initiatives saved more than 153 million gallons of jet fuel and avoided almost 1 .5 million metric tons of 
CO
2e emissions in FY16 — equivalent to 
the CO 2 emissions generated by more 
than 150,000 homes in one year. In addition, we are actively exploring viable 
alternative fuels to help power our jets.
FedEx Fuel Sense identifies efficiencies 
across our aviation operations. Front-line team members, expert representatives 
from various departments, and our 
dedicated Fuel Management Office all generate ideas and contribute to a 
companywide culture of fuel-saving 
behavior. 
Many of our retired aircraft are donated 
to college aviation programs, airport fire agencies, museums and nonprofits such 
as Remote Area Medical, which provides 
free, quality health care to people in need in remote areas of the United States and 
around the world.
Alternative fuels progress
In FY15, we entered into an agreement 
with Colorado-based Red Rock Biofuels to 
purchase 6 million gallons of alternative jet 
fuel on-site — half Jet A and half biofuel — meeting current aviation regulations 
and ultimately producing at least 48 million 
gallons over an eight-year period. 
Over the past year, delays have occurred 
which have impacted the construction of the fuel production facility. In 2019, FedEx expects to utilize the first 6 million gallons 
of this jet fuel on-site.
Benefits of alternative fuels include 
expanding and/or diversifying energy 
sources, reducing emissions, supporting economic development, often in rural 
communities, and the potential to 
promote price and supply stability. We continue to collaborate with government agencies, academia and alternative-fuel 
suppliers in search of low-emission fuels 
that can be produced competitively and at scale. We do not assume that all biofuels 
are beneficial and consider environmental 
impacts before including them in our fuel mix. 81,577,538

EFFICIENCY
With more than 180,000 owned and 
contracted vehicles, our global ground 
transportation operations continue to offer 
potential for efficiency gains. In FY15, we delivered on this potential, by exceeding 
our 2020 goal of improving FedEx Express 
vehicle fuel use efficiency by 30 percent from 2005 levels. To meet our new goal of 
a 50 percent fuel efficiency improvement 
by 2025, or 17 percent improvement from 
a 2015 baseline, we will continue to apply 
proven innovations — optimizing truck routes, upgrading our vehicle fleet to more 
efficient models, instilling good driving 
habits and exploring alternative fuels and technologies.
In FY16, through the FedEx Express 
Reduce, Replace, Revolutionize strategy 
and intermodal rail shipping at FedEx 
Freight, we saved more than 43 million gallons of fuel and avoided more than 
444,000 metric tons CO
2e. This is 
equivalent to the carbon sequestered by more than 400,000 acres of U.S. forest in 
one year. 21,433,384

2017 FedEx Global Citizenship Report37Our first priority is to reduce overall 
mileage by optimizing routes. We match 
vehicles to journey based on load volume 
and route length, and plot the shortest routes. We also apply our logistics 
expertise to reduce “empty” miles when 
trucks travel with less than optimal loading. 
We employ efficient technologies such 
as automatic transmissions, low-rolling-
resistance tires, trailer skirts that minimize 
drag and diagnostic equipment. We also help drivers improve their efficiency by reducing idle time, controlling speed and 
using progressive shifting techniques.

to reduce “last-mile” deliveries by offering 
more customer pickup locations. 
When replacing any surface vehicle, we 
upgrade to cleaner, more efficient models wherever possible. In FY16, we added more than 800 alternative-fuel/technology 
vehicles to our fleet. At our FedEx Freight 
Oklahoma City Service Center, we installed a compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling station and purchased more than 
100 CNG tractors in early FY17 . Read more 
about this initiative here. 
Looking ahead, we believe that wider 
adoption of alternative-fuel and advanced technology vehicles will play a critical 
part in reducing global GHG emissions. 
Specifically, we are exploring greater use of electric and fuel cell powered vehicles, 
among other advanced technologies, 
along with alternative-fueled vehicles. However, the current environment of low fuel prices could make investment in 
expanding alternative fuel refining capacity 
more challenging for suppliers.

progress
Government and industry organizations 
that FedEx works with to improve the 
transportation sector’s environmental 
performance include:
• U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
SmartWay® Program
• European Express Association
• U.S. Federal Aviation Administration 
• U.S. Department of Energy, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and National Clean Fleets Partnership
• International Air Transport Association and Airlines for America

Regulatory developments
In FY16, two major regulatory 
developments were underway with 
significant implications for FedEx 
operations. The United Nations 
International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO) began the approval process for new global aircraft CO
2 emissions 
standards focused on large aircraft 
weighing over 60 metric tons, which 
account for more than 90 percent of international aviation emissions. 
ICAO works with member states and industry groups to reach consensus on international standards and policies in 
support of a safe, efficient, economically sustainable and environmentally 
responsible civil aviation sector. The 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may align with the new ICAO 
standards and implement them for 
U.S.-manufactured commercial aircraft, affecting future new designs for aircraft 
in 2020 and newly produced aircraft in 
2028. FedEx supported the development of a CO
2 emissions standard, the ICAO 
Committee on Aviation Environmental 
Protection’s recommended standard, and 
its anticipated adoption by the U.S. EPA into national law. 
The EPA has also strengthened medium- 
and heavy-duty vehicle efficiency 
standards through additional greenhouse 
gas and fuel efficiency regulatory 
rulemaking. FedEx was actively involved 
in the EPA ’s stakeholder engagement process and provided comments to 
the proposed GHG Emissions and Fuel 
Efficiency Standards for Medium and Heavy Duty Engines and Vehicles — 
Phase 2 regulation. We believe this 
presents an opportunity to further improve fuel efficiencies and lower GHG 
emissions from the national fleet using a 
comprehensive and harmonized approach. In fact, FedEx was the first transportation 
logistics company to call upon the federal 
government to develop these standards. Other proposed regulatory changes which 
FedEx supports include:
• The 33 Foot Trailer Legislative Initiative, 
which would permit twin 33-foot 
trailers on federal interstate highways, improving safety, and reducing fuel consumption and associated GHG 
emissions 
• California’s AB1520, which would extend current law to enable business customers to generate clean, reliable 
on-site power without threat of punitive utility fees on electricity generated 
from the on-site resource 
Longer term, FedEx supports the U.S. federal government’s goal to reduce 
energy dependence, including cutting oil imports by 50 percent from 2012 levels 
by 2020. We believe the path to achieving 
this includes increasing the nation’s use of energy-efficient vehicles powered 
by electricity and alternative fuels, as 
FedEx is doing in its own fleet. We also support domestic energy production, such 
as delivering wind turbine parts using 
specialized equipment.

inclusion
Each FedEx operating company provides 
opportunities for internal teams to support 
workplace inclusion initiatives. These 
include diversity and inclusion team member councils, affinity groups and 
Business Resource Teams (BRT). FedEx 
Express, for example, supports eight affinity groups including African American, Hispanic, Asian, Women, Cancer Support, Multifaith, LGBT and Friends and U.S. Military Veterans. In FY16, FedEx

by minorities, and more than 22% of global management roles were held by women in FY16.Women at FedEx

lacking in gender diversity. We are strongly

into managerial and leadership roles, offering programs that help women 
advance in their careers and providing

were 5,060 women in managerial roles 
across FedEx in FY16.

veterans, transitioning service members 
and military spouses find meaningful employment opportunities. For more than

Representative Initiative that connects 
veterans to career resource opportunities and supports organizations that address 
issues that disproportionately affect 
veterans. FedEx Services participates in an eMentor Leadership Program that pairs
