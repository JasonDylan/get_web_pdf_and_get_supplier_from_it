5TABLE OF CONTENTSPRIORITIZATION
Boeing’s environmental strategy 
is guided by a comprehensive 
review and assessment of the 
most significant environmental 
challenges and risks facing  
the company.  
The analysis included direct 
input and perspectives from 
diverse stakeholders —such as 
customers, environment-focused 
non-governmental organizations 
(NGO) and the company’s global 
leadership — as well as research 
into industry best practices and 
community requirements.
This assessment helped Boeing 
identify and update our understanding 
of current and emerging sustainability 
issues that are critical to the company 
and our stakeholders. It also informed 
our next-generation environmental 
strategy and targets.
Most Significant Environmental 
Risks and Opportunities
The assessment analyzed 
diverse viewpoints and organized environmental risks by level of priority 
as identified by Boeing and its 
external stakeholders. The risks relate 
to products, operations and a variety 
of other issues. Several risks and 
opportunities were named highest 
priority by both Boeing and our 
external stakeholders:
•  Products Greenhouse gas  
(GHG) emissions; fuel efficiency, 
operational efficiency, and 
sustainable aviation fuel.
•  Operations  GHG emissions; 
energy conservation; water 
management; solid waste 
management/waste to landfill.
Boeing included additional 
high-priority risks and opportunities —
such as managing hazardous 
materials over the product life cycle in our operations and managing 
chemicals in aircraft production — as 
well as opportunities like pursuing 
innovations in alternative materials 
and environmentally progressive 
buildings.
External stakeholders added supply 
chain practices and reporting and 
mitigating product noise as high 
environmental priorities.
The relative ranking of environmental 
risks helps shape priorities, but we 
will address all identified issues in our 
global environmental strategy.
Global Environmental Trends
The assessment reported current 
and emerging global trends that 
may affect Boeing’s business, 
including climate change, resource scarcity, rapid urbanization, regional 
collaboration on environmental 
regulations and rapid innovation in 
new technology.
Environmental Leadership
The analysis concluded that Boeing 
has in place the policies and 
governance to address the most 
significant environmental risks the 
company faces. Opportunities to 
strengthen our leadership include 
improving the measurement and 
reporting of progress made to 
environmental goals, with increased 
transparency in communication to all 
stakeholders. Work is underway in 
these areas.

Global Environmental Landscape
Aviation is an integral part of modern 
life. It links people, communities, 
cultures and countries around the 
globe. The air transport industry 
today supports an estimated  
62.7 million jobs and $2.7 trillion  
in global gross domestic product 
(GDP), according to the Air Transport 
Action Group.
Aviation also affects the planet and 
our shared global environment.  
 As the industry continues to grow, 
Boeing recognizes that pollution, 
natural resource scarcity and climate 
change are serious issues that 
require credible actions and global 
solutions.
The United Nations (U.N.) estimates 
that the world’s population hit 7.6 
billion in mid-2017 and adds another 
83 million people every year. By 2030, 
the population will reach 8.6 billion, 
and increase to nearly 10 billion 
people by 2050.A growing population and 
urbanization will further boost global 
demand for transportation, with the 
industry being challenged to meet 
the demand without a corresponding 
growth of emissions, community 
noise or other potentially harmful 
environmental effects.Employees assemble the

“We are 
experiencing the 
most rapid changes 
in our global 
environment since 
humans evolved 
as a species,” 
said Stephen Thor 
Johnson, president 
of North American 
Land Trust.
“My colleagues and I are inspired  
and motivated to take meaningful 
steps to keep our environment 
healthy and resilient, with projects 
that can be models and inspiration  
for others to follow.”
Through an agreement between 
Boeing and the North American 
Land Trust *, a national nonprofit 
land conservation organization, 
about 2,400 acres (971 hectares) 
within the Southern California Santa 
Susana Field Laboratory  will be 
forever protected from residential 
and agricultural development, 
regardless of future ownership. 
The property is home to a number 
of sensitive species and serves 
as a wildlife corridor ensuring the viability of animal species that 
depend on the ability to move 
throughout large territories. The 
property also includes important 
cultural resources, including Native 
American archaeological sites, which 
are protected by the conservation 
easement. 
In addition to Boeing’s ongoing 
progress with cleanup and site 
restoration, the transformation of 
Santa Susana is well underway, with 
native plants and animals reclaiming 
most of the previously developed 
areas of the field laboratory. Santa 
Susana is home to more than 16 
plants and animals that are either 
endangered, rare or a special species 
of concern. The site includes unique 
plants such as the Braunton’s 
milkvetch and the Santa Susana 
Tarplant, which serve as critical 
habitat for pollinators and other 
animal species.  
“The opportunity to collaborate with 
Boeing to conserve such a significant 
tract of wildlife habitat and cultural 
and historic resources is a once-in-a-
lifetime opportunity. To do so within 
an hour’s drive of 20 million people 
is simply extraordinary. The value of 
this open space will be magnified 
over the coming decades and be 
remembered as a truly visionary act 
like the creation of Central Park or the 
conservation of the Presidio.”SECURING SANTA SUSANA’S OPEN SPACE

9TABLE OF CONTENTSNumerous efforts at 
Boeing have been 
historic “firsts,” 
helping move the 
aerospace industry 
toward a more 
sustainable future. 
Developing technologies like biofuel, 
which lower carbon emissions up to 
80 percent, are essential in reducing 
aviation greenhouse gas emissions.
Boeing has been a leader in creating 
industry partnerships to promote 
the development and use of biofuel. 
Boeing helped organize the first 
biofuel test flight in 2008 by Virgin 
Atlantic on a Boeing 747, using a 
biofuel blend, illustrating the potential WORKING TOGETHER AS CLEAN  
TECHNOLOGY LEADERS
Fuel of the Future
Scientific studies show 
that biofuel—made 
from waste cooking 
oil, purpose-grown 
sustainable crops that 
don’t compete with food 
and land resources, and 
other sources—reduces 
life-cycle emissions up  
to 80 percent compared to 
fossil fuel.
Development has 
progressed significantly  since Boeing, Virgin 
Atlantic and other 
partners first tested 
biofuel in 2008. Five 
production pathways 
have been approved and 
airlines have flown more 
than 120,000 passenger 
flights on a blend of 
biofuel and regular  
fossil fuel.
Boeing works on six 
continents to expand 
development. Through our partnership with 
Sunchem SA and SkyNRG, 
for example, farmers in 
South Africa are growing 
nicotine-free tobacco 
that’s converted into 
biofuel. We’re supporting 
LanzaTech a company 
that makes biofuel from 
steel mill waste industrial 
gases.
We’re also working with 
several fuel producers to 
gain approval of renewable diesel, a sustainable fuel 
widely used in ground 
transportation. We verified 
performance of the fuel, 
called HEFA+ in aviation, 
on our 757 and 787 
ecoDemonstrator flight-
test airplanes. Annual 
production capacity  
could meet more than  
2 percent of global 
aviation demand at a price 
that’s competitive with 
fossil-based fuel.
 Boeing, Alaska Airlines and the Port of Seattle collaborate on 
the goal of powering all flights at Seattle-Tacoma International 
Airport with sustainable aviation fuel. (Alaska Airlines photo)for industry-wide collaborations for a 
more sustainable future.
In 2016, the first commercial flights 
using biofuel in Africa, with South 
African Airways and its sister airline, 
Mango, on Boeing 737s, proved 
that countries with developing 
economies can also lead in clean 
technology. Today, Boeing works 
with stakeholders on six continents to 
develop, commercialize and integrate 
biofuel into airports.
Boeing’s ecoDemonstrator program,  
now in the fifth iteration, serves as a  
test bed to develop other technologies 
designed to enhance the safety, 
efficiency and environmental 
sustainability of future airplanes. The 
2018 ecoDemonstrator, a FedEx 
Express Boeing 777 , marked the  
first time a commercial aircraft flew 
100 percent biofuel.

Collaboration is key to meeting 
the aviation industry’s CO 2 
reduction goals.Boeing is committed to a healthy 
environment and more sustainable 
future as the aerospace industry 
adapts to changing market forces.
Environmental Regulation
The numbers of regulations and 
environmental concerns affecting the 
aerospace industry are increasing 
and include the following:
•  Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
•  Airplane community noise.
•   Local air-quality emissions for 
products and factory operations.
•  Chemical restrictions in 
manufacturing operations and 
product content.
•  Water quality issues, such as 
stormwater.
•   Hazardous waste.
•  Energy consumption and the use  
of renewable energy in operations.
Chemicals and  
Regulatory Restrictions
Global regulation of chemical 
substances continues to grow. To 
illustrate, regulations expanded  
50 percent per year from 2003 to 
2013—more than 50 times overall. 
That trend continues as efforts to 
reduce chemical exposure from 
consumer products affect more 
industries, including aerospace.Commercial Aviation  
and Climate Change
Aviation contributes approximately  
2 percent of global CO 2 emissions,  
according to the U.N.’s Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change. 
New global agreements reached in 
2016 support achieving the industry-
established goals and a global sectoral 
approach to controlling emissions:
•   A fuel-efficiency performance 
standard for aircraft.
•   A global market-based measure 
system called Carbon-Offsetting and 
Reduction Scheme for International 
Aviation (CORSIA). 
Implementation of these agreements 
into regulatory frameworks around the 
world is underway.
Customer Requirements
The aviation industry’s business goals 
of providing safe, cost-efficient travel 
and environmental goals of reducing 
CO2 emissions are both achieved 
by constantly improving airplane fuel 
efficiency. Reducing emissions is 
aligned to our customers’ strategic 
desire to decrease fuel use, a major 
cost and priority in their purchasing 
decisions. Our customers increasingly 
require that Boeing’s products and 
services include environmentally 
progressive attributes that will help 
them address environmental concerns 
without sacrificing performance or 
increasing life-cycle costs.2010

Global, Collaborative, Sector-
Wide Approach to Regulations
The International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) took two historic 
actions in 2016, representing the 
world’s first sectoral commitment 
to address climate change. The UN 
agency’s work began 10 years ago 
with technical support from Boeing 
and other stakeholders.
ICAO adopted a carbon-offsetting 
system that will help aviation stop 
the growth of CO 2 emissions from 2020 onward. Seventy-three member 
states have agreed to participate so 
far, representing nearly 88 percent of 
international flights.
ICAO also adopted the world’s 
first industry-specific, global 
CO2 emissions standard for 
aircraft certification. Boeing’s 787 
Dreamliner, 737 MAX and 777X were 
designed to meet the challenging 
requirements and help fulfill the 
standard’s goal to reduce emissions.
Accelerating Innovation
Boeing’s ecoDemonstrator flight-
test program plays a key role in 
our efforts to speed up technology 
development that will enhance airplane situational awareness 
and improve operational and 
environmental performance.
Since 2012, the ecoDemonstrator 
program has researched more than 
60 other technologies using a 737, 
757, 787 and Embraer E170 as test 
platforms. Redesigned Advanced 
Technology winglets tested in 2012 
are now used on the 737 MAX.
This year the program tested more 
than 30 technologies aboard a 
777 Freighter, including a Boeing-
designed and built compact thrust 
reverser that could enable a future  
for larger, more efficient engines.
A new compact nacelle—the housing for a 
jetliner’s engine—will help enable advanced 
engines that reduce fuel use and emissions.  
It’s being tested on the 2018 ecoDemonstrator 
777 Freighter.

Boeing’s commitment to improving 
its environmental footprint can 
be seen at hundreds of factories, 
offices and other facilities around the 
globe. Our employees have made 
conservation of energy and natural 
resources a way of doing business 
for decades. 
For example, the company’s energy 
consumption in 2017 was essentially 
the same as it was in 2007, even 
with the company’s growth from 
$66.4 billion in annual revenues to 
$93 billion— a 41 percent increase. Annual airplane deliveries rose  
71 percent. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency has recognized Boeing’s

22TABLE OF CONTENTSDRIVING EFFICIENCY, OPTIMIZING OPERATIONS
In July 2017, Boeing launched a 
third major business unit, Boeing 
Global Services, which combined 
the majority of services capabilities, 
including Boeing subsidiaries Aviall 
and Jeppesen, into one services-
focused business. 
With a focus on innovative services 
in engineering, digital aviation and 
analytics, supply chain logistics, and 
training support, Global Services 
delivers solutions that can drive 
efficiency, optimize operations 
and improve our environmental 
performance.
Boeing, through its subsidiary 
Jeppesen, offers services that 
enhance airplane efficiency by 
using data analytics and real-time 
information. Services such as Fuel 
Dashboard, Direct Routes and Wind 
Updates help airlines optimize routing 
based on weather, air traffic and 
other factors. Jeppesen works with 
more than 120 airlines and corporate 
flight departments, reducing fuel use 
an average of 4.3 percent.
Additionally, Jeppesen provides 
digital flight operations solutions to 
airline representatives to improve 
situational awareness on the ground 
and in the air as well as increase 
fuel savings through the elimination 
of paper-based material weight. 
Through these new services and 
guidance from Jeppesen, our goal is 
to eliminate paper and transition to a 
fully digital operating environment. waste and reusing packaging 
materials in distribution centers. 
The Kent-Benaroya Distribution 
Center in Washington State has 
developed several packaging  
reuse strategies that have reduced its 
environmental footprint and lowered 
business costs. In 2017,  
this program saved more than 
42,000 pounds (19,050 kg) of 
waste, with the additional benefits 
of conserving natural resources 
and reducing life-cycle energy and 
packaging material waste. 
One specific project created a 
“packing pillow” using packing 
material that was considered too One of Aviall’s locations in the 
Netherlands also has made 
environmental performance a 
competitive advantage by obtaining 
authorizations to safely and 
compliantly provide critical aerospace 
chemicals within the European 
Union. Our Aviall team continues to 
work with suppliers and customers to 
support research and development 
of environmentally preferred materials 
and processes.
Boeing Global Services supports 
sustainability activities in its operations 
across the globe. Examples include 
implementing lighting controls to 
conserve energy, enhancing the 
recycling program to reduce landfill small or not suitable to reuse alone. 
The packing pillow allowed the  
site to reuse more than 18,000 
pounds (8,164 kg) of packaging 
material in 2017. 
Along with conservation efforts, 
the Spares Distribution Center in 
Washington State manages its 
Industrial Stormwater Permit with 
the assistance of a bioswale, which 
slows and filters runoff from the 
27-acre (109,265 sq m) facility. It has 
assisted the facility in maintaining 
compliance with its stormwater 
permit for the past seven years.Tools such as Boeing’s Fuel 
Dashboard improve the 
operational efficiency of 
the in-service fleet. Boeing 
analyzes data from airline 
operations and simulates 
scenarios to assess the 
amount of fuel required 
for a given flight. The 
comparisons enable airlines 
to identify and implement 
opportunities for improve -

2424TABLE OF CONTENTSFrom 2012 to 2017, Boeing generated 
fewer greenhouse gas emissions, 
used less water, sent less solid 
waste to landfills and generated less 
hazardous waste—all reduced from 
14 to 26 percent. The significant 
improvements came during a time  
of unparalleled growth in our 
business, with record airplane 
deliveries. The people and projects 
driving Boeing’s environmental 
progress are profiled and highlighted 
throughout this report.
As you will see in the next section, 
starting this year, Boeing has 
implemented new, more aggressive 
environmental performance goals 
through 2025, demonstrating 
an ongoing commitment 
to strengthening our global 
environmental leadership.

U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency’s (EPA) 2018 new release 
of the national year 2016 eGRID 
emissions factors, which represent 
the emissions footprint of all electric 
power sources. We apply the new 
factors to the previous two years. A 
significant decrease in the emissions 
factor was identified for the whole 
nation. This was mainly caused by reduction of coal-derived electricity 
under EPA’s Clean Power Plant 
Program. To ensure data accuracy 
and reflect reality, Boeing recalculate 
the 2016 and 2017 data, which 
caused a decrease of the emissions 
previously calculated and reported 
for those years. We substantially 
exceeded all goals.

27TABLE OF CONTENTSThrough innovation in design, 
manufacturing and operations, 
Boeing aims to reduce the lifecycle  
environmental footprint of its products. 
Environmental requirements will be 
designed in for cleaner products in 
each phase of product manufacturing 
and service life. Addressing our 
environmental footprint from the 
beginning to the end of service is important for providing manufacturing 
solutions including greater energy 
efficiencies while working toward 
eliminating hazardous chemicals in 
production processes.
A focus on cultivating valuable 
partnerships, like those developed 
within Boeing’s HorizonX ventures, 
allow for advancement of science 
and environmentally progressive innovations. Boeing’s acceleration of 
advanced technology and product 
development, including investigating 
small electric or hybrid electric 
aircraft, continued support of large-
scale biofuel usage, and proactive 
management of chemical restrictions 
in the aerospace industry are only 
a few ways we plan to innovate for 
performance.        
Boeing looks to improve the 
environmental performance of its 
operations by setting aggressive 
targets for reducing greenhouse gas  
emissions, energy and water use, 
hazardous waste generation and 
solid waste sent to landfill. (See chart 
on the next page.) Boeing also  
works with suppliers by setting 
environmentally responsible requirements. Our strategy includes 
collaboration with the aerospace 
supplier base to promote sustainable 
manufacturing and operations 
practices, and allow us to work 
together toward a common goal of 
improving the aerospace industry’s 
environmental performance.
Achieving excellence in sustainability 
through this new strategy builds upon Boeing’s long-standing commitment 
to excellence in cleaning and 
restoring at-risk sites affected by past 
practices. By setting an example 
as a global leader, we will grow our 
commitment to protect human health 
and the environment while complying 
with all relevant global environmental 
rules and regulations.  Boeing’s new environment strategy  
has three central focus areas:

“Air traffic will continue to grow; we 
need to serve and lead the growth in 
an environmentally responsible way,” 
Fernandes said. “It means increasing 
efficiency and reducing emissions, 
not just on current products, but also 
products of the future and emerging 
forms of commercial and urban 
mobility.”
Although we can’t see the future, 
“we can try to shape our future by 
deeply engaging in developing our 
technology and continuously adding 
new capabilities in our processes 
and products,” he said. “By helping 
to shape the innovation journey, 
we’re building a more sustainable

BUILDING STRATEGIES
The 737 Completion & Delivery 
Center in Zhoushan, China will be 
a showcase of energy efficient and 
sustainable building strategies and 
a demonstration of Boeing’s global 
commitment to environmental 
leadership.
The completion center is a joint 
venture between Boeing and 
Commercial Aircraft Corp. of  
China. When fully operational, it  will install aircraft interiors on  
737 MAX airplanes bound for 
Boeing’s Chinese airline customers. 
The aircraft will be painted on site 
and transferred to customers at the 
adjoining delivery center. 
The facility features state-of-the-art 
energy efficiency and resource 
conservation strategies, including:
•  Using recycled materials in the 
building’s frame and interiors•  Providing onsite electric vehicle 
charging
•  Retaining or evaporating 98% of  
site stormwater
 •  Using collected rainwater for  
100% of landscaping irrigation
• Recycling 75% of waste 
•  Conserving resources with use  
of features like high-efficiency  
water fixtures and HVAC systems 
and LED lighting•  Using daylight to illuminate 75%  
of interior spaces 
• Securing LEED certification
Boeing also worked closely with local 
governments on the facility’s design 
and construction.

resources to support a wide range of 
recycling and conservation projects, 
from implementing lighting upgrades 
and supporting maintenance teams’ 
conservation ideas to working with 
city utilities on finding water leaks. 
Her passion for the environment 
started early; her father was an 
engineer and her mother a teacher. 
“My father would share the challenges 
and solutions he faced in the energy 
industry; my mother instilled the 
values of being a life-long learner,” 
Gilbertson said. 
The early inspiration still moves her 
today. “We all can take an action or 
make a choice every day that will 
conserve resources and move us to a 
more sustainable future, at work and 
at home, too.”
Conserving and 
Protecting a Valuable 
Natural Resource
Boeing saves millions of 
gallons of water every 
year with new technology 
and creative approaches 
to reducing overall water 
use and waste. Innovative 
materials also help 
manage and improve the 
quality of stormwater run-
off from company sites.
A few examples: Boeing 
will save 22 million gallons It’s hard to miss 
Beth Gilbertson’s 
enthusiasm for her 
work as a utilities 
and conservation 
specialist at 
Boeing’s 737 
factory  in Renton, 
Washington.
“Every day I have the opportunity to 
work with amazing teammates as 
we look for new ways to help Boeing 
reduce its energy and water use and 
reduce waste. I know we’re making a 
difference in helping Boeing shrink its 
carbon footprint and move toward a 
more sustainable future,” she said.
(more than 83 million 
liters) of water annually—  
a nearly 90 percent 
reduction—thanks to 
a new water recycling 
system at the Everett, 
Washington, Interiors 
Responsibility Center, 
which manufactures 
aircraft interiors. Boeing 
Portland uses reverse-
osmosis technology to 
recycle and reuse 13 million 
gallons of water a year.An innovative new 
material that shows 
great potential in 
improving the quality 
of stormwater runoff 
is moving from the 
laboratory to field tests 
in 2018. Permeable 
pavement is a porous 
paving material that 
allows stormwater 
to percolate through 
the surface to the soil 
below where the water 
is naturally filtered and 
pollutants removed.Boeing also works 
closely with community 
groups such as The 
Nature Conservancy on 
stormwater mitigation 
projects in Washington, 
California and other 
states.
THE FUTURE OF ENERGY REDUCTION
Beth Gilbertson
In the 2018 Battle of the 
Buildings* (BoB), 47 sites 
in six countries helped 
Boeing reduce energy 
use. The format of friendly 
competitions among  
facilities will be used 
in future conservation 
campaigns.
*See Endnotes 3232TABLE OF CONTENTSAs the leader of 
Boeing’s largest 
manufacturing site 
outside the U.S., 
Mike Bunker points 
with pride to the 
innovation of his 
Aussie teammates 
in setting the course 
for a cleaner, more 
sustainable future.“It’s in simple steps, like eliminating 
disposable coffee cups to working 
with our local utilities on the possibility 
of installing solar panels to generate 
clean power on site,” he said.
Bunker leads Boeing Aerostructures 
Australia (BAA), in Melbourne, which 
builds control surface parts, such 
as wing flaps and winglets, for most 
Boeing aircraft models.
The site has completed soil and 
groundwater remediation from 
operations that predate Boeing's 
ownership and stretch back to 
World War II. Bunker said BAA is 
following an aggressive strategy to 
reduce energy use and greenhouse 
gas emissions, conserve water, 
expand recycling and improve its 
manufacturing processes, while  
also continuing to grow and build 
more products.
“I love being a part of building more 
environmentally friendly aircraft, in 
factories that produce less waste, use 
less energy and leave the site better 
than how we found it. It’s beautiful  
to me.”

  In addition to data from Boeing’s 37 Core 
Metric Sites, data from Portland, Oregon 
(PDX Paint Hanger), and the Phoenix, 
Arizona, Data Center also included.
  1 metric ton = 2,204.62 pounds.
  Carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO 2-e, 
means the number of metric tons of CO 2 
emissions with the same global warming 
potential as one metric ton of another 
greenhouse gas (in accordance with EPA 
40CFR98 Mandatory Greenhouse Gas 
Reporting).
  GHG emissions are calculated based on 
consumption of electricity, natural gas and 
fuel oil. (Our facility in Philadelphia is the 
only major U.S. site that uses No. 6 and 
other fuel oils for heating and curtailment 
backup.) Consumption of other fuels is not 
represented.
   2016 emission numbers are recalculated 
based on new eGRID2016 factors.
  For U.S. sites, Scope 1 emissions from 
natural gas, fuel oil and on-site generated 
electricity are calculated using the 
emission factors provided in U.S. EPA 
GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule. Scope 2 
emissions from purchased electricity are 
calculated using the market-based method 
and eGRID sub-region factors, since 
residual mix is not available in the U.S. 
For the Canada site, Scope 1 emissions 
are calculated using the emission factors 
provided in U.S. EPA GHG Mandatory 
Reporting Rule; Scope 2 emissions are 
calculated using the market-based method 
and the supplier-specific emission factor. 
For the Australia sites, Scope 1 emissions 
are calculated using the emission factors 
provided in the National Greenhouse 
and Energy Reporting (NGER) Scheme, 
and Scope 2 emissions are calculated using market-based method and the 
emission factors provided in the National 
Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) 
Scheme, since residual mix is not available 
in Australia. Emissions calculated with 
location-based method are: 1,247,000 
tons (1,131,000 metric tons) CO 2e (2017). 
Emissions calculated with Market-based 
method are: 988,000 tons (896,000 metric 
tons) CO2e (2017).
  RECs were applied to the GHG 
calculation for the following locations: 
North Charleston, South Carolina, and 
6 Puget Sound locations in Washington. 
In 2017, these Boeing locations made 
arrangements to purchase RECs to offset 
around 125,000 tons (113,000 metric tons) 
of GHG emissions.

  1 metric ton = 2,204.62 pounds.  Carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO 2e, 
means the number of metric tons of CO 2 
emissions with the same global warming 
potential as one metric ton of another 
greenhouse gas. (In accordance with EPA 
40 CFR Part 98 Mandatory Greenhouse 
Gas Reporting Accounting protocol.) 
This GHG inventory is prepared using the 
following protocols:
 •  The Greenhouse Gas Protocol:  
A Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (Revised Edition)
 •  The Scope 2 Guidance 
 •  GHG Reporting Guidance for the 
Aerospace Industry (IAEG) 
 •  The Australian National Greenhouse  
and Energy Reporting Act 2007
 •  The United Kingdom’s CRC Energy 
Efficiency Scheme
   Scope 2 emissions are calculated using 
the market-based method. Location-based 
method calculated emissions are 988,000 
tons (896,000 metric tons) CO 2e. Residual 
mix is only available in EU countries; 
therefore, other grid average emissions 
factors are used in all other countries. In 
the market-based methodology, RECs 
were applied to the GHG calculation for 
the following locations: North Charleston, 
South Carolina and 6 Puget Sound loca -
tions in Washington. In 2017, these Boeing 
locations made arrangements to purchase 
RECs to offset around 125,000 tons 
(113,000 metric tons) of GHG emissions.
   Other calculation factors: Data source of 
global warming potentials (GWP) is U.S. 
40 CFR Part 98 subpart A, table A-1. For 
GHG inventory in North America, emission 
factors for combustion sources come from 
U.S. 40 CFR Part 98, subpart C, table C-1. 
For GHG inventory in the U.K., emission 
factors from the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme are used. For GHG inven -
tory in Australia, emission factors from the 
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting 
Act are used. For GHG inventory in locations 
where energy data are not accessible, 2012 
CBECS factors are used to estimate the 
energy consumption and emission factors 
from the International Energy Agency’s CO2 
Emissions From Fuel Combustion Highlights 
2013  and 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories  are used to 
calculate the emissions.
