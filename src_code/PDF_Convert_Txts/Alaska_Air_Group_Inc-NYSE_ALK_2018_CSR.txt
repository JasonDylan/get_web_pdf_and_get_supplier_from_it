Creating Lift  
through Sustainability
Welcome to our 2018 Sustainability Report. We continually seek ways to be a responsible company – to secure 
futures for young people, to make flying greener, strengthen our culture, and to support the communities where 
we live and work.

Message from our CEO
At Alaska Airlines, we talk often about the principle 
of lift – the force that enables an aircraft to leave the 
runway and take flight. It’s the foundation of flight.  But 
it also inspires us to think bigger. How do we create 
lift for all of those who depend on us? 
The answer to that question is ultimately 
straightforward. It means being responsible for our 
impact, controlling what we can control, and always 
striving to do better. 
We highlight this work every year in our sustainability 
report. But our annual report is more than a collection 
of metrics and data. It’s ultimately Alaska’s story. It’s 
the efforts of our team to maintain the most fuel-
efficient and environmentally friendly fleet in the 
country.  It’s the dedication of our flight attendants 
who help us maintain the most comprehensive 
recycling program of any U.S. airline. It’s the 
generosity of our guests who last year donated 53.8 
million miles to help organizations like the Nature 
Conservancy, United Negro College Fund, and Make-
A-Wish. It’s our shared community coming together 
and supporting Aviation Day, which helps kids learn 
about opportunities in aviation.     I am proud of our team and what they do each day 
to take people where they need to go safely, while 
also growing careers and opportunities, giving back 
to our communities, being conscious of our impact, 
and delivering value to our stakeholders. We have 
been around since 1932, and sustainability also means 
running the business for the long run, so we can 
continue to do this good work for the next 87 years. 
I invite you to learn more about Alaska’s story in the 
pages that follow and on our site at FlySustainably.
com.  Thanks for joining us in this journey of lift. 
Sincerely, 
Brad Tilden

 6 Report introduction      Q&A with Alaska Airlines VP of External Relations 
Message from  
Diana Birkett Rakow,  
VP of External Relations
If you’ve flown with a kid lately, you know that the moment the airplane leaves the ground, it feels like magic. In 
fact, the Alaska Airlines employees-turned-elves Fantasy Flight crew in Spokane, Washington, have made that 
magic very real the first weekend of every December for the last 20 years—giving kids who wouldn’t otherwise 
have the opportunity a ride to “Santa’s workshop” for holiday cheer, warm clothes and a gift request come true.
That magical moment is thanks to the physics concept of “lift.” Centuries upon centuries after sailboats used this 
concept to cross oceans, engineers built curves into airplane wings—forcing air above the wing to travel farther, 
and therefore faster, than air below the wings, lifting the plane into the air. 
But what if we could translate this idea, the collective force of air particles acting around a wing, into our 
environment, our communities and the people who make up our business? In its origin, lift was a bold idea—
seemingly simple, but creating infinite possibilities for people, commerce and connection.
For us, it’s both our past and our future. It’s why we work here. We love aviation, and we know that being a 
resilient, responsible business requires us to create lift on all fronts. It means investing in our people, cultivating a 
diverse and talented workforce, innovating to reduce our environmental impact and resource use, using our flying 
to support those in need, and enabling and inspiring young people to pursue their dreams.
7 Report introduction      Q&A with Alaska Airlines VP of External Relations 
These aren’t easy things, and we don’t have all the answers. We value 
the chance to partner with those who are also on the path to fly and live 
greener, better, more sustainably. In 2018, we worked hard across Alaska 
and Horizon toward our social and environmental impact goals and 
priorities: 
In 2018, we made real progress within our company and toward our 
social and environmental impact goals and priorities:
• Removing 22 million plastic straws and stir sticks from our aircraft in 
 favor of sustainable alternatives
• Improving our inflight recycling—already the best in the business— 
 by Integrating our inflight service training across all aircraft types in our  
 mainline fleet
• Half of our independent board members are women—and we were 
 the first West Coast based Fortune 500 company to do this. This 
 means better diversity of thought, and ultimately better decisions
• Bringing the total number of Airbus 321 neo aircraft in our fleet to eight, 
 each over 50% more efficient than the older Airbus 319s.
• Signing memorandum of understanding agreements with Sea-Tac 
 International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and Neste, 
 a sustainable fuels company, to continue to figure out ways to be more 
 fuel-efficient and to make sustainable aviation jet fuel a commercially  
 viable and locally-produced option.We also began to focus our social impact to inspire, empower, and 
enable young people—especially those who don’t start out with a lot 
of opportunity—to make career connections and improve economic 
mobility. We’re making a long-term commitment to hone our own version 
of lift: fueling to explore and learn critical thinking and critical skills; 
mentoring and enabling programs for kids to find their voice and believe 
in their strengths; providing internships for young people to explore 
work pathways; and hiring, training and promoting a diverse workforce. 
We’ll continue to learn with and from our people, our partners and our 
communities about where and how we can best contribute.
We’re made of up 23,000 and the many more who’ve served our 
company over the decades. Millions more fly with us, inspire us and keep 
us striving for better ways to serve. Many of these remarkable people 
started with us as young people themselves, growing families, exploring 
new realms of aviation or growing their careers to finish school and try 
new things. As our hubs and the beautiful places we live and fly continue 
to grow and flourish, we owe it to each other to be strong, resilient and 
thriving for the long term. 
That kind of lift will take all of us. Thank you for being part of this journey.
Sincerely,  
Diana Birkett RakowWe are all about people.
8Our diverse, passionate, and dedicated team of people embodies a culture that displays an unwavering commitment to the safety of our 
guests and employees alike, and continually embraces the challenges of an ever-changing industry. In return, we strive to create a rewarding 
workplace for the long term, to provide opportunities for people to grow in their careers, and to treat all individuals with fairness and respect. 
Our strategies
Because our ability to succeed depends so heavily on our people, we choose to focus our attention on three priority areas:Our business is fundamentally about lifting people – as a team. We do this by 
empowering our employees and helping them feel engaged, by providing stellar 
service to our guests and by giving back to those in need in the neighborhoods where 
we fly. It’s all about treating people with respect and valuing their individual gifts.

and guest 
safety.
Diversity and 
inclusion in the 
workplace.

9 We are all about people           Employee and guest safety. 
Safety is our #1 core foundational value,  
and always will be. 
We are committed to achieving the highest 
possible level of safety for every employee, every 
guest, every flight, every day. By encouraging our 
employees to preemptively report their concerns, 
and by including safety metrics in our annual 
bonus program and operating under the first safety 
management system in the U.S. to be accepted by 
the FAA, we’ve created a culture of safety woven 
throughout every aspect of our business. 
Promoting and incorporating a culture of safety into 
all aspects of our operation is paramount to the way 
we run our business, and critical to our long-term 
success. Our Safety Management System (SMS) 
places the responsibility for safety in every employee’s 
hands by reporting what they see in the workplace, 
helping to prevent incidents and identify risks before 
they occur. Alaska assesses risk on a scale of 1–5.  
Alaska and Horizon Air saw 6 Risk Level 3+ events in 
2018, a 40 percent improvement from 2017. Employees continue to file safety reports, up 14.7 
percent from last year. Our Report It! reporting 
software is available for use by all employees, 
and the key is to make it easy. Report It! allows 
employees to use mobile tools to file employee 
safety reports in a central data repository. This makes 
the sharing of safety information between divisions 
not just easier, but faster and more accurate. 
Additionally, we continue to integrate safety goals 
into our company-wide Performance-Based Pay 
program to drive positive safety behaviors and to 
target areas of specific focus. We awarded bonuses 
to 180 employees who prioritized safety in the 
workplace as part of our Safe Operations Award & 
Recognition (SOAR) program – a program that has 
been in place since 2014.
Our goals: Increase employee safety 
reporting by 26%  over 2017 baseline 
(reports per employee) and decrease 
medium risk (3+) safety events by 20% .
10 We are all about people      Employee and guest safetyDiversity and inclusion  
in the workplace.
Diversity makes us stronger. It fuels innovation, 
sparks creativity and cultivates an atmosphere 
of continuous learning and improvement.
We believe that championing a culture of diversity 
and inclusion starts from the top. We are proud 
to have achieved 50% gender balance company 
wide. Our independent board directors are 50% 
women, and Alaska is the first company—and as 
of 2018, the only West Coast based Fortune 500 
company—to have accomplished this. We were 
proud to be recognized for our gender diversity 
in governance by the Women’s Forum of New 
York, and for diversity overall by the Puget Sound 
Business Journal and National Association of Corporate Directors. In addition to ranking second* 
among the top 25 companies in the U.S. for women 
on its board, Alaska’s board includes leaders 
from diverse backgrounds, including members 
of Asian, Native Alaskan and Hawaiian ancestry. 
Having diversity on our board is valuable, with 
varying perspectives leading to better discussions, 
decisions and results.
Our investment in diversity extends to our 
employees, and our communities. 
Our goal: Integrate diversity and inclusion initiatives 
into people strategies of our four largest work groups, 
representing 85%  of employees. 
11 We are all about people      Diversity and inclusion in the workplaceBusiness Resource Groups (BRGs)
Our 14 BRGs are groups of employees who come together 
based on shared characteristics, interests, or life experiences 
to celebrate a common cause. BRGs are generally based 
on providing support, enhancing career development, and 
contributing to personal development in the work environment. 
In 2018, our BRGs created plans that directly align to advancing 
our inclusive culture, initiatives and business. These include 
groups that support our Black/African American, Hispanic, 
LGBTQ+ and women’s communities, and many more, and have 
significant influence to guide our company. Respect and Equality for all
In 2018, Alaska Airlines continued our commitment to equality 
for LGBTQ people by joining the Human Rights Campaign’s 
Business Coalition for the Equality Act and to endorse this 
important piece of legislation to ensure equality for all. 
We’re proud to partner with organizations like HRC, Lambda 
Legal, and the Frameline Film Festival and others to reflect 
this commitment – including through more public events, 
advocacy, and employee engagement in many Pride Parades 
across the communities we serve. 
In 2018, we talked a lot about respect – and implemented 
sexual misconduct prevention & response training, including 
an anti-bias module, for all people leaders across the 
company. We also integrated training for unsafe or unfair 
situations into our required compliance training suite for all 
employees, strengthened our People Policies, and updated 
onboard announcements and written information to make our 
commitment to safety at all levels clear.50%

12 We are all about people      Diversity and inclusion in the workplaceHonoring those  
Who Serve 
Alaska is a proud supporter of all 
members of our military, both past  
and present. 
A significant number of our employees are veterans, and we show our support in many 
ways throughout the year. We support veteran job seekers through information sessions, 
an Alaska-hosted web portal for veteran job seekers, and our Military Fellows program, 
which places former and current military personnel in temporary management positions, 
allowing them to translate their valued leadership skills in a corporate environment. 
Some of our notable activities around veterans in 2018 included:The Stand Up and Be Counted campaign
An important goal is to make sure we can identify our veteran community, so we can further 
engage and provide resources to succeed.  To do so, we ask our employees to disclose if 
they are a veteran. 
The Fallen Soldier program
An employee-driven volunteer effort to honor those who served by transporting the remains of 
our nation’s fallen heroes with the greatest care and respect. In 2018, we added two additional 
Fallen Soldier Carts, for a total of 11 across our airport network. These carts are a core part of 
honoring these heroes. All our employees have access to this program, which provides the 
military protocols to follow when transporting a fallen soldier, and we openly share the tools 
from our program with other airlines. When a fallen soldier arrives at one of the airports served 
by this program, the entire plane and gate area goes quiet in honor and respect.
Honor Flights
Where we help the men and women who have served enjoy once-in-a-lifetime visits to 
Washington, DC. In 2018, we flew 400 World War II, Korean War and Vietnam veterans 
on 15 Honor Flights to Washington DC to view their war memorials. Since 2012, we 
have flown more than 3,270 veterans on 65 Honor Flights.   
13 We are all about people      Diversity and inclusion in the workplaceEmployee engagement.
Great service begins with great employees,  
and ours are some of the best in the business. 
We hire people whose values align with our own: 
our employees do the right thing, are kind-hearted, 
deliver on performance and own safety. They are 
remarkable. We are committed to the growth and 
development of every individual who works here, 
and that they feel valued, heard, and have a range 
of opportunities to be remarkable.
As we grow, we are committed to learning from our 
employees about how to preserve core elements 
of Alaska’s small-company feel that translates into 
deep and genuine connections with each other 
and our guests. In 2018, as we wrapped up the 
vast majority of integration milestones from our 
merger with Virgin America, we recognized that we 
needed to make a significant investment in coming 
together as one team. To this end, and with input from volunteers across all 
our workgroups, we developed and launched a new 
program called Flight Path, which brought every 
employee to Seattle for a day of discussion about 
our history, business model, values, and strategy – 
an open question, answer, and listening time with 
senior leadership. We know that this is just one step 
in a journey, but were gratified to see employees’ 
feedback reflecting a better understanding of our 
purpose after attending Flight Path.To fully focus on 
this investment and understand employee needs 
following completion of the Flight Path sessions, we 
postponed our 2018 Employee Engagement Survey 
until in mid- 2019, so we don’t have an engagement 
metric update for 2018. Mergers and integrations 
are always a challenging time for employees – but 
we’re committed to the path forward, together.Our goals: Increase employee engage- 
ment scores to 80%  or more, with  
no less than 75%  for any division and 
be nationally recognized as a great 
place to work.
14 We are all about people      Employee engagementWe fly  greener.
15We’re always looking for ways to improve the efficiency of our operations and 
reduce the burden we place on the planet. Alaska has a proud tradition of 
innovation in environmental performance.
Our strategies
Our strategy is focused on the key areas where we have the greatest impact or see the most opportunity for innovation:
Reducing  
our aircraft  
emissions.
Reducing waste  
from our  
inflight service.
Decreasing  
our paper 
consumption.
16 We fly greener            Reducing our  
aircraft emissions. 
Fuel use and emissions remains our top 
opportunity.
As a member of the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) and Airlines for America 
(A4A), we are working alongside other airlines to 
address the challenge of climate change. We have 
adopted a set of global targets to mitigate CO2 
emissions from air transport, and are working to 
meet these goals through: 
1. Improved technology, including the deployment 
 of sustainable low-carbon fuels 
2. More efficient aircraft operations 
3. Infrastructure improvements, including 
 modernized air traffic management systems 
4. A single global market-based measure to fill the 
 remaining emissions gap on international routes In 2018, our overall emissions intensity (CO2 per 
revenue ton mile, or RTM) improved very slightly 
by .1%. We maintained our emissions intensity 
at a 13% improvement per RTM over our 2009 
baseline year.   The integration of Airbus aircraft 
into our fleet let to a temporary flattening of our 
efficiency gains, but we expect to return to our 
long-term trend of improvement in 2019.
Our goal: Decrease aircraft CO 2 
emissions by 17% per RTM over 2009 
through increased fuel efficiency and 
sustainable aviation fuels.
17 We fly greener      Reducing our aircraft emissionsIn 2017 we finalized installation of split scimitar winglets on all our eligible 737 aircraft, 
improving average fuel efficiency by over 34,000 gallons per aircraft each year. Aircraft 
fitted with split scimitar winglets are roughly 4.5% more fuel efficient than those without 
winglets. In 2018, the scimitar winglets modification saved approximately 4.5 million 
gallons of fuel. 
Our Boeing fleet is now 100% “NG” (Next Generation), supporting a high-level of 
efficiency. In our Airbus fleet, we took delivery of our first four A321neo aircraft in 2017, 
followed by four more in 2018. Equipped with ultra-efficient CFM LEAP-1A engines, the 
aircraft flies 102 seat miles per gallon—compared to the A319, which gets 65 seat miles 
per gallon.

18 We fly greener      Reducing our aircraft emissionsWe continued our use of RNP approaches and departures. Required Navigation 
Performance (RNP) is a performance-based navigation technique that uses a combination 
of onboard navigation technology and the GPS satellite network to fly safer, more reliable 
approaches. RNP technologies save an estimated 1.2 million gallons of fuel annually due 
to reduced track miles. 
We also continued our Arrival Fuel Program that encourages smart choices that optimize 
the use of fuel when planning and selecting alternate landing sites.  Through this, we 
save an estimated 300,000 gallons of fuel annually. Alaska is also partnering with 
NASA, as the sole airline to use new technology to optimize flight paths in real time.  This 
technology, known as Traffic Aware Planner, is estimated to be able to save between 
8,000 and 12,000 gallons of fuel per aircraft each year.  
How we fly
gallons of fuel saved
from using RNP in 2018  01200009The fuel we use
In 2018, we continued to build strong foundational partnerships with industry leaders 
in the sustainable aviation fuels arena. We are working with the port authorities, other 
industry leaders, local and state government representatives, and major producers to 
develop the strategy for a sustainable fuels path for SeaTac, San Francisco and other 
airports on the West Coast. By the end of 2018, we had signed partnership agreements 
with the Port of Seattle, San Francisco airport, and Neste—a renewable fuels company 
that is pioneering sustainable aviation fuel.
Procuring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that is priced competitively with traditional 
fuel has been difficult. We are searching for the best ways to obtain the volume of fuel 
that we need at the right price. In the meantime, we continue to make progress by 
partnering with alternative fuel companies, stakeholder groups, and industry steering 
committees to accelerate this innovation.
19 We fly greener      Reducing our aircraft emissionsReducing waste from our 
inflight service. 
Our robust, inflight recycling program is the 
most comprehensive of any U.S. airline. 
Recycling is a point of pride for our flight 
attendants; without their hard work and dedication 
our recycling efforts would not be so successful. 
In 2018, we were the first airline to eliminate 
plastic straws and stir sticks inflight.  We partnered 
with the Seattle-based nonprofit Lonely Whale, an 
organization that drives impactful market-based 
change on behalf of our oceans, to support this 
initiative.  This eliminates over 22 million non-
recyclable plastic items annually. 
Our combined waste to landfill dipped to 0.14 lbs. 
per passenger in 2018 for our Boeing fleet and 
our Horizon regional aircraft.  This reduction is 
largely due to our robust recycling efforts. Flight 
attendants captured a weighted average of 76% of 
all recyclable materials used onboard our aircraft, 
including cans, bottles, cups, paper, and plastic 
serving ware. To date, we have reduced our waste 
to landfill by 65% since our baseline year of 2010.  We’re excited about the progress, and about our 
Airbus and Boeing teams working together on 
a common service flow and recycling program. 
Mid-integration, our 2018 auditing process 
likely underrepresented our Airbus fleet, and we 
realize as a result that our waste per passenger is 
somewhat higher than .14 pounds per passenger.  
Our 2019 auditing process will better capture our 
entire integrated fleet in this metric.
Our goal: Reduce inflight 
waste sent to landfills 
by 70%  over our 2010 
baseline (lbs./passanger).
20 We fly greener      Reducing waste from inflight serviceDecreasing our paper 
consumption. 
Using new technologies as they become 
available, Alaska Air Group is pushing to become 
as paperless as possible. 
It started in 1995, when Alaska became one of 
the first carriers in the nation to offer ticketless 
travel; we’ve since gone on to adopt several 
other strategies in our efforts to transition away 
from paper, such as online software, mobile 
applications, and digital documentation. 
In 2018, Alaska and Horizon reduced paper 
consumption by an additional 5% per departure 
over 2017—that’s 39% less paper per departure 
and over 23 million fewer sheets of paper than we 
used in 2012. In summer 2018, we launched a digital flight 
release program called “JetPack” for Horizon 
pilots.  By digitizing the documentation needed 
for flight releases, we will decrease pilot paper 
use by an additional 30-60 pages per flight. 
Our goal: Reduce 
paper consumption  
by 50%  per departure 
over 2012.
21 We fly greener      Decreasing our paper consumptionWe invest 
for strong 
communities.
22We invest in many ways to support communities in our backyards—especially youth, education, and  
workforce development, with the goal of impacting 100,000 young people and workers by 2020.
Working with partners across our communities, we aim to inspire, empower, and equip young people for 
future opportunities – whether in aviation or beyond. With a goal of improved economic opportunity for young 
people, we support and partner with nonprofit organizations, host events and activities, and volunteer our time. 
The programs we support have impacted the lives of more than 88,000 young people since 2014. Additionally, 
we’ve provided educational opportunities for 453 airport workers since 2014 through Airport University, a 
program designed to provide airport workers with the skills training needed to advance their careers.
We are proud to report that we met or exceeded our 2018 goals in this area and will continue to look at ways 
to learn and improve our impact., and have increased our goal to reflect the higher number of youth and worker 
lives we hope to impact in the coming years.
In 2018, more than 19,685 young people and workers participated in Alaska-sponsored programs, bringing 
our cumulative number of youth and workers impacted by our efforts to 88,841 since we began measuring 
in 2012. Of the $17 million in philanthropic contributions that Alaska Air Group provided in 2018, 35% was 
specifically directed at educational and workforce development. The programs we support and track include 
a variety of local education initiatives, events, activities, partnerships, donations and employee volunteer 
time. Employees of the company have also served on key government-appointed committees and leadership 
councils focusing on helping young people prepare for future success.We are inspired by flying and the opportunities it 
creates. We want to see more students, from all 
backgrounds, have the chance to become future 
leaders in aviation—or any industry.

23 We invest for strong communities             Some of the more notable initiatives of the past year include:
• The Alaska Native Science Engineering Program (ANSEP) is a key recipient of our  
 support. ANSEP’s objective is to effect systemic change in the hiring patterns of  
 Alaska Natives in science and engineering by placing students on a career path to 
 leadership. In 2017, Alaska Airlines renewed its partnership with ANSEP as part 
 of our commitment to education in our communities. With this second, three-year  
 $1 million grant, Alaska Airlines’ total investment in ANSEP is now $2 million. Funds 
 will help transport nearly 2,000 students from rural areas of Alaska to Anchorage to 
 attend ANSEP’s Middle School Academy education program at the University of  
 Alaska Anchorage. Our support provides access to educational opportunities and  
 the associated economic benefits not otherwise available for thousands of Alaskans. 
• In 2018, Alaska Airlines served as the lead corporate partner for the San Jose Public  
 Library Foundation’s Coding 5K Camps, which offered free coding programs and lunch  
 to children in Silicon Valley.  Alaska Airlines also worked with the City of San Jose to offer  
 the very first Girls Coding camp in 2018.  More than 30 employees volunteered to  
 coach and speak with students at the Alaska Airlines Aerospace Education Center  
 (AAAEC) at Seattle’s Museum of Flight. This immersive, aerospace learning experience  
 gives underserved high school students a chance to experience the magic of flight and  
 learn about aviation careers and pathways from Alaska Airlines employees.  
 • We partnered with The Road Maps Project in South King County to host multiple 
 sessions at a one-day program called DiscoverU, impacting more than 180 students 
 in 2018. DiscoverU provides high school students at Title I schools with the 
 opportunity to explore their career interests, tour companies, and learn about the 
 skills and education needed to get there. 
• Alaska also proudly partners with Port Jobs at Sea-Tac airport through its economic  
 opportunity and workforce development initiative called “Airport University.” The  
 program provides a career trajectory for our employees and other airport workers by  
 providing them the training and professional skills needed to advance to better  
 positions in airport operations. In 2018, 88 airport workers completed a course at  
 Airport University, bringing the total number of workers supported through the  
 program to 453 since 2012. In 2017 we renewed our partnership with Port Jobs  
 through 2020 and are providing a $1.5 million grant to support training, workforce  
 development, job placement, and education funding. Out of this funding,  
 approximately $150,000 is dedicated to a scholarship fund for airport workers  
 seeking additional educational opportunities.
24 We invest for strong communities      Economic and educational outcomes We make  flying matter.
25The airline industry can make a big difference in people’s lives, beyond travel for 
business or leisure. We aim to make a positive impact through things like charity 
miles, disaster relief efforts, honoring those who serve, and by protecting the 
beautiful places we live and fly.
Our strategies
Our strategy is focused on the key areas where we have the greatest impact or see the most opportunity to make an impact:
Giving back through 
Charity Miles.
Investing in  
important causes.
Disaster relief.
26 We make flying matter             Giving back through

Our Charity Miles program offers 
Mileage Plan™ members a unique and 
meaningful way to support important 
causes and use travel for impact. 
Members can donate their miles to help people and organizations who need to have an 
urgent or mission-driven need to get from here to there. 
In 2018 alone, more than 53,000,000 miles were donated by our passengers, valued at 
approximately $1.4 million.52.3M           $1.4M

To support the following 10 organizations:
27 We make flying matter             Partnering with those 
around us to support 
communities
We provide airline tickets for 
organizations to support their 
fundraising and other travel  
that supports them in achieving  
their mission. 
In 2018, we provided airline tickets to over 1,300 nonprofit organizations with 
$7.6 million of in-kind ticket donations. The carefully selected community-based 
organizations who receive these donations use the airline tickets for auctions and 
raffles to raise support for their organizations. Additionally, tickets were donated for 
philanthropic efforts, such as medical travel with Angel Flight West. In 2018, Alaska

28 We make flying matter             Disaster Relief
Part of running a great airline is supporting the communities we serve,  
especially in times of need. 
We have a long-standing relationship with the American Red Cross and AirLink, and make monetary and Charity Miles donations to support relief efforts in the wake of natural 
disasters. In 2018, we donated $50,000 to the California wildfire relief efforts, in addition to our annual support of the Red Cross 365 program and Airlink. Our employees can 
also have their charitable donations matched through our matching gift program.
Donated 2M miles from our Charity 
Miles Pool to Airlink, a rapid response 
disaster relief organization that 
links airlines with pre-qualified non-
governmental organizations to transport 
aid workers and cargo to disaster areas.Contributed $25K to the Red Cross, 
who provided shelter, meals, and 
mental health services to those 
impacted by the fires in California.Donated $100K and 1.5M miles to 
the American Red Cross for ongoing 
disaster support including the fires in 
California and the earthquake in Alaska.

safety.Decrease medium risk safety events (3+)  
by 20% over 2017.40%
reductionWe had 6 medium safety risk events in 2018: a reduction of 40% compared to 2017. 
Employee safety reporting increased to 26%  
over 2017 baseline (rate/10,000 departures).Up 14.7%Our employee reporting increased 14.7% over 2017. Increased reporting helps target safety 
improvements in our operation, and contributes to driving down our high risk safety events.
Employee 
engagement.Employee engagement scores at 80% or more 
(with no less than 75% for each division). N/AOur Flight Path employee engagement program began in 2018 and targeted engaging every 
employee.  Due to a vendor change, we postponed our survey until 2019. 
Great Place To Work recognition by at least 
one external national organization. 1 of 1 Alaska was ranked among Forbes’ “America’s Best Employers” for the fourth year in a row.
Integrate diversity and inclusion initiatives into the 
people strategies of our four largest work groups. 3 of 4Our divisional work has progressed well, and is on track to complete all four largest work  
groups as well as smaller groups in 2019.
Ethical labor 
standards  
for suppliers.Embed Alaska’s Supplier Code of Conduct  
into all vendor contracts. 72%Continued momentum in 2018, with the challenge that only a portion of contracts are  
renewed each year.

ASM Available seat mile Airline passenger carrying capacity. It is equal to the number of 
seats available multiplied by the number of miles flown
CO2e Carbon dioxide 
equivalentsA standard unit for measuring a carbon footprint. It expresses the 
impact of each different greenhouse gas in terms of the amount 
of CO2 that would create the same amount of warming.
GHG Greenhouse gases A greenhouse gas is a gas that absorbs infrared radiation (IR) and 
radiates heat in all directions. Examples include: carbon dioxide 
(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (NOX).
GJ Gigajoules A measurement of energy equal to one billion (109) joules. 6 
GJ is about the chemical energy of combusting 1 barrel (159 l)  
of crude oil.
LTI Lost time injury Accidents resulting in personnel not being able to work as a 
result of their injury.
MWh Megawatt hours A megawatt hour (Mwh) is equal to 1,000 Kilowatt hours (Kwh). 
It is equal to 1,000 kilowatts of electricity used continuously  
for one hour.
NR Not reportedOJI On the job injury Employee Injuries that occur while at work.
RPM Revenue passenger mile A measure of traffic for an airline flight calculated by multiplying 
the number of revenue-paying passengers aboard by the 
distance traveled.
RTM Revenue ton mile One ton of revenue traffic (passenger and/or cargo) transported 
one mile.
RNP Required navigation 
performanceA type of performance-based navigation (PBN) that allows an 
aircraft to fly a specific path between two 3D-defined points in 
space using satellite technology.  This safer, more reliable, and 
more direct navigation system saves fuel by reducing track miles.
