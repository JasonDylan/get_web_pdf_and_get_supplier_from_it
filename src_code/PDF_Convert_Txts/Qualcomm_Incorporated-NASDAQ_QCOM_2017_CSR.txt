from Our CEO  
As CEO, I am frequently asked what my vision is for Qualcomm. The short 
answer is to continue to be the inventors for what’s next in the increasingly 
smart and connected world. With our legacy of mobile technology invention, 
executional excellence and deep investment in research and development, we have a tremendous opportunity to provide the technical foundation for others 
to build unprecedented and yet-to-be-defined products, experiences and new 
industries. The number of industries that we impact has grown dramatically since our founding in 1985, and it will continue to grow as 5G proliferates.
As an industry leader, we create value for all our stakeholders, including 
investors, employees, customers, suppliers and the global communities in which 
we live and work. At Qualcomm, doing business responsibly means developing 
technology that positively transforms the world, operating with unquestioned integrity, providing a respectful, inclusive workplace and much more.
Throughout 2017, we delivered on this value proposition in many ways. As 
members of our global community, we support the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) and believe that investments in technology are 
key to empowering communities worldwide. For example, our Qualcomm
® 
Wireless Reach™ program demonstrates new and innovative ways to utilize 
mobile technology to achieve sustainable development, and over the last 
10 years has positively impacted more than 12 million people in 47 countries. 
This report highlights the work we are doing to address the SDGs across our sustainability programs.
We remain committed to recruiting, retaining and building upon our 
inclusive and diverse workforce. Earlier this year, I joined other CEOs and 
business leaders in signing the “ CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion ” 
pledge, agreeing to promote diversity and inclusion values and to foster an 
open exchange of ideas and corporate culture best practices. One initiative 
supporting this commitment is our Qualcomm
® Thinkabit Lab™, which has engaged thousands of diverse students in career and hands-on engineering activities that focus on collaboration and innovation to help inspire young 
people to create, invent and choose a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) career. I’m proud of our programs and initiatives in this 
area and look forward to continuing our collective work to help drive results 
that will benefit the greater society.
I am also very proud of the support we’ve provided to those in the United 
States, Mexico and multiple Caribbean nations affected by the natural disasters of 2017. To assist with disaster relief, response and rebuilding efforts, 
Qualcomm and the Qualcomm Foundation committed to donate a combined 
$2.25 million to a range of organizations providing shelter, emergency services, food and other needed near-term supplies, as well as toward long-term 
recovery programs. This pledge included funds earmarked to match our 
employees’ personal donations to support these causes beyond our regular charitable match program annual limits.  
While our strong commitment to technology leadership will help drive an era 
of rapid innovation unlike anything we have seen before, we will continue to 
invent technologies that help empower people and enhance the quality of life 
around the globe. We are committed to changing the world through our efforts to do business in a responsible and sustainable manner.

Our Key Accomplishments: Qualcomm® Wireless Reach™China: Using mobile technology to 
modernize education and alleviate poverty
In China, there are more than 40 million children living in impoverished  
areas. The development levels of these children, particularly in health  
and education, are far behind the average. The Qualcomm 21st Century Classroom program, a collaboration between Wireless Reach and the China Children and Teenagers’ Fund (CCTF), is a mobile broadband-based 
learning program that has developed a cutting-edge, 21st century learning 
environment in select classrooms at three schools located in government-designated, poverty-stricken areas in the Sichuan Province.
200 teachers trained 4,000 students taught  
 
The Qualcomm 21st Century Classroom program supports the Chinese 
government’s use of information and communications technology (ICT) to modernize education and reduce poverty. Mobile technology 
has fundamentally changed access to educational materials and this 
collaboration enables even greater opportunities to enrich teaching and learning, and address learning disparities by decreasing the digital divide.
Since program implementation began in late 2015, 200 teachers and 4,000 
students - ages 7 to 15 - have benefited. Teachers have received a total of 152 
hours of instructor-led trainings, and 80 percent of teachers who participated 
in the trainings report their teaching skills and ICT knowledge have improved. In addition, over 450 teaching materials have been created and shared via 
an online platform. Based upon the program results achieved in the Sichuan 
Province, Wireless Reach is collaborating with CCTF to expand the program  to additional schools in the Jiangxi province.

Our Key Accomplishments: Qualcomm® Wireless Reach™India: Creating technology-based 
entrepreneurship opportunities for  rural youth
In India, approximately 70 percent of the nation’s 1.3 billion people live  
in rural areas. Largely due to poverty and illiteracy, many of these citizens  
are unaware of government entitlements that exist to help them. In addition, 
they may not have access to the internet, which could provide information about programs for which they are eligible.  The Soochnapreneur program, a collaboration between Wireless Reach 
and the Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF), equips rural youth with advanced wireless technologies that enable them to become entrepreneurs and deliver much-needed information about government entitlements and 
other digital services to citizens as a fee-based service. These youth are called 
Soochnapreneurs – a name derived from the words “Soochna,” which means ‘information’ in Hindi, and “entrepreneur.” Through this program, rural youth 
can earn a livelihood, help lift their families out of poverty and contribute to their 
communities. Since the program began, 100 Soochnapreneurs have assisted over 8,000 rural beneficiaries in applying for benefits, such as housing and 
emergency medical expense coverage or maternal benefits, and have earned 
an average monthly income of Rs. 1,600 through delivery of these services.
100  Soochnapreneurs 8,000+  rural beneficiaries
This program aligns with the Government of India’s Digital India Plan with  a focus of empowering citizens through ubiquitous access to the internet  
and spreading the use of mobile phones. The Soochnapreneur program
demonstrates how advanced wireless technology helps bridge poverty gaps for rural citizens through access to information and delivery of services to those most in need. Given its success, Wireless Reach and DEF plan to add an 
additional 100 Soochnapreneurs, with a focus on recruiting women.
Through this program, rural youth can earn  
a livelihood, help lift their families out of poverty  and contribute to their communities.

Our Key Accomplishments: Qualcomm® Wireless Reach™Philippines: Improving public health data 
management systems with wireless access
The Philippine Field Health Service Information System (FHSIS) is the 
government’s major resource for managing public health data. Data from  
the system is used for policy analysis and planning at all levels of the public 
health system. Most of the data originates during patient care at barangay (village) health stations, city health centers, rural health units and hospitals.  
It is up to the doctors, nurses and other healthcare providers at these facilities 
to treat patients, record their information and assemble clinic-wide reports. T raditionally, health care providers collect this information manually, recording 
on paper, which can be labor intensive and prone to errors. An electronic 
medical record system can improve access to quality patient records for clinicians and data to the FHSIS.
Supported by Wireless Reach, and in collaboration with  
various stakeholders through a multi-sector collaboration, the  
Wireless Access for Health (WAH) program is designed to improve  
health care in the Philippines by reducing the time required to record  
and report health data, while also improving access to accurate and 
relevant patient information for frontline health care workers, clinicians  
and decision makers. WAH leverages new and innovative technology to 
improve the quality and timeliness of data at health clinics. The ability to 
easily view, record and share patient information across multiple devices 
within a health clinic allows clinicians to complete patient consultations earlier in the day and provide more support to community health workers.
160+ clinics 1.3 million+ patients served
28 provinces 3,300+ clinicians trainedThe WAH platform has been successfully adopted in more than 160 clinics in 28 provinces in the Philippines, serving on average 8,500 patients a day.  
More than 3,300 clinicians have been trained on the platform and many have 
confirmed improvements in their ability to generate reports and retrieve and store information. The time-savings from the use of mobile has resulted in over 
1.36 million patients served since the start of the program. Patient care has 
improved and health visits have increased as they are handled more efficiently, having reduced the time needed to search paper records from several minutes 
to mere seconds. Local governments are committed to sustaining and growing 
WAH and have incorporated its efforts into their budgets, including allocations for mobile devices, personnel and system maintenance.

Our Key Accomplishments: Qualcomm® Thinkabit Lab™Providing free Thinkabit Lab resources to 
broaden our impact
As part of our Inspired by Thinkabit Lab expansion initiative, we  
announced the creation of the Thinkabit Lab Toolkit. This free, online  
set of resources helps schools and other organizations, regardless of their 
location, create their own Inspired by Thinkabit Lab experiences. Based on lessons learned at our original Thinkabit Lab, the Toolkit provides 
step-by-step guidance on how to develop and implement our engaging, 
hands-on engineering projects and career exploration activities. Currently, there are more than 20 Inspired by Thinkabit Lab sites in various stages of 
development across the United States and exploration globally.
In addition to our Inspired by Thinkabit Lab sites, we continue to work with 
universities, such as the University of Michigan (U-M). We are collaborating 
with U-M’s College of Engineering, Center for Engineering Diversity and Outreach and Office of Student Affairs to provide students in Detroit and 
southeast Michigan with a Thinkabit Lab experience. The new lab is located 
inside the Michigan Engineering Zone, an innovative makerspace within the U-M Detroit Center downtown. In its first year of operations, the lab 
will serve more than 1,500 students from 20 schools throughout the Detroit 
Public Schools Community District.  
"We are committed to contributing our industry 
knowledge and experience to the community and 
other organizations interested in establishing STEM programs. Our intent is to advance our wireless ecosystem and better prepare students to thrive in  a diverse workforce.”
– Erin Gavin, Director, Thinkabit LabIntegrating Io T into the Thinkabit  
Lab experience  
We also expanded our Thinkabit Lab Signature Activities to provide students 
with innovative experiences and integrated learning concepts in growing 
STEM fields, such as invention, IoT, creative robotics and communications. 
Exposing students to these topics is important because devices are becoming increasingly connected with one another; in the future, this interconnectedness 
will be a part of everyday life. 
Today’s students need to understand how IoT and other new technologies will 
positively impact their future so that they can be prepared to pursue careers in 
these exciting STEM areas. For example, during the QWOW IoT activity, students become inventors and imagine a world in which “things” such as mobile devices, 
thermostats, appliances and motion sensors discover each other, connect, 
interact wirelessly and intelligently respond to human needs. Working in small groups as “start-up companies,” the students then use the design process to 
dream up IoT-based inventions that can help others in the areas of consumer 
electronics, smart homes, smart cities, voice and music. One group of students envisioned a drone delivering food to people in need, such as starving people in 
rural areas or people in areas affected by natural disasters. They represented their 
invention by attaching a piece of fruit to the end of a popsicle stick, connected the stick to a motor and programmed the motor to rotate.

in our communities
Qualcomm Employee Networks (ENs) are employee-driven, enterprise-
supported networks, focused on promoting the professional growth of our 
employees. They offer collaboration and encouragement among employees; 
in the greater community, they promote and demonstrate inclusion and diversity at Qualcomm. We offer nine unique ENs that support specific 
employee populations around the world: women, Africans and African 
Americans, Latinos, military veterans, millennials, the lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgendered (LGBT) community and employees with disabilities, as 
well as employees who are caregivers of those with special needs. Currently, 
we have over 30 EN chapters around the world and our goal is to continue strategically expanding.
Here are just a few examples of activities offered by our ENs this past year:
• We celebrated LGBT Pride during the month of June with a variety of 
events led by our EN that fosters a safe, inclusive, supportive and open work environment for all employees, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity 
or gender expression. Several of our campuses, including our corporate 
headquarters, flew rainbow flags throughout June, and our CEO and other executives walked in the San Diego Pride Parade for the third consecutive 
year. EN-led activities ranged from a webinar that educated employees on 
how to create LGBT-inclusive workplaces to a volunteer event that assembled LGBT school resource and engagement kits benefitting PFLAG – a nonprofit 
organization that offers support, education and advocacy to LGBT persons 
and their families and friends. 
• Our EN focused on the African and African American community provided STEM outreach to local schools and universities in San Diego by inviting students and introducing them to our technology and careers in tech, as well 
as attending local community events. The network also worked closely with 
our campus recruiting team on conferences and university engagements with the objective of helping identify talent. On campus, they organized a film 
festival with weekly networking opportunities.

Our Key Accomplishments: Improving the Environment GloballyReducing our carbon footprint
In September 2015, we announced our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
reduction goal: to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our 
global operations by 30 percent, compared to a 2014 baseline, by 2025.  
Since then, we have implemented several direct emissions reduction activities that, through the end of December 2016, have resulted in approximately nine 
percent GHG emissions reduction from our 2014 baseline. These projects 
included consolidating office space and implementing energy efficiencies in various locations worldwide, as well as achieving LEED Gold certification for 
our new 219,000 square foot facility in Bangalore, India.
~9% GHG emissions reduction 
from our 2014 baseline through the end of December 2016
In addition, in 2017, we invested in a portfolio of carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates (RECs) to achieve three percent of our 
total GHG emissions reduction goal of 69,191 metric tons of CO
2e (tCO2e) 
through Natural Capital Partners – a company that specializes in helping 
businesses to meet their GHG and renewable energy targets through external projects. Our carbon offset purchases supported low carbon, sustainable development projects in China and India. For example, the 
Sichuan Household Biogester project is a Gold Standard CDM (Clean 
Development Mechanism) project that distributes small-scale biogas plants across the Sichuan Province, China. By using livestock waste to 
generate energy, low-income households get access to clean, affordable 
power and improved waste management that delivers better sanitation and health and well-being. The installation and maintenance of the biogas 
plants also creates employment in the region. By offsetting our carbon 
footprint, we can bridge the gap between our reduction target and our internal GHG efficiency program, while also contributing to essential  
low-carbon, sustainable development around the world.

Our Key Accomplishments: Improving the Environment GloballyEngaging our suppliers to use water  
more efficiently 
To ensure the sustainable management of water across our value chain, we 
expect our manufacturing suppliers to use water efficiently, reduce wastewater, 
reuse and recycle water and treat wastewater to regulatory standards prior to 
discharge or disposal. Because semiconductor processing is water intensive, we work closely with suppliers that make our integrated-circuit products to 
promote efficient water use. One example is our recent collaboration with one 
of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers, Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd (SPIL) . We sponsored a water recycling infrastructure project 
at SPIL that would allow treating up to 264,000 gallons of wastewater per day for reuse. During the construction of the recycling systems, our team tracked the progress and ensured operational effectiveness of the project. Various 
functions across SPIL were also involved, including wastewater quality, quantity 
inspection and process assessment. This new recycling system applies the latest membrane filtration technology.Turning sludge into clean energy:  
a win-win solution
In 2016, we provided financial support to World Resources Institute’s (WRI) 
sludge-to-energy initiative in China and India. The aim of this project was 
to study sludge-to-energy systems to prove the economic, environmental 
and energy benefits of these systems. Building on the success of a pilot project in the city of Xiangyang, China, WRI engaged key stakeholders, 
including academia, global NGOs and policymakers, to analyze and 
implement innovative city wastewater treatment solutions in select cities in China (Beijing, Changsha, Chengdu, Hefei and Qingdao) and India 
(Bangalore and Pune). As a result of WRI’s research in Xiangyang, the 
central government also selected 100 additional cities to pilot the use of waste-to-energy systems for kitchen wastes. WRI estimated that by 2020, 
waste-to-energy systems in China will have reduced emissions by 20 million 
tCO
2e – an amount equivalent to the annual emissions of 4 million cars. 
Further uptake of sludge-to-energy systems will reduce water pollution and 
help China to reach its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.  
Other project outcomes included development of a carbon calculator to 
help city leaders and other decision-makers estimate the energy recovery 
and GHG emission reduction potential from sludge-to-energy approaches 
and the first-ever comparative policy gap analysis for China and India that identities specific opportunities and challenges to bringing innovative 
approaches to scale.  Sludge-to-energy approaches help cities address a 
multitude of rising problems: waste management, public health, sanitation, clean water, energy demand and climate change. WRI is now working with 
the World Bank and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to promote 
sludge-to-energy systems globally.*World Resources Institute: http:/ /bit.ly/2mNLyfGWastewater-to-Energy System*

Our Key Accomplishments: Improving the Environment GloballyStove Trace: promoting the adoption of clean 
cooking technology
Approximately 3 billion people – about 40 percent of the world’s population–
depend on traditional cookstoves that use fuels like firewood, cow dung and 
crop residues for their cooking needs. The carbon emissions from these mud 
stoves contribute to the deaths of roughly four million people annually as a result of inhaling the smoke and soot they produce. T raditional cookstoves  
also contribute to global climate change. Alternatively, at a cost of 
approximately $40 to $100 each, clean cookstoves are too expensive for  the more than 2 billion people worldwide living on less than $3 per day.
To address this challenge, Wireless Reach is collaborating with Nexleaf 
Analytics, the Energy and Resources Institute New Delhi, Project Surya and 
other organizations to incentivize the usage of clean cookstoves by developing 
and deploying StoveTrace  – an affordable, reliable, mobile phone-based 
temperature sensing application that monitors and verifies the reduction in 
carbon emissions through the use of clean cookstoves. The StoveT race system 
enables widespread participation in a voluntary carbon market when individuals use clean cookstoves instead of traditional biomass burning cookstoves. 
“I am happy to have been blessed with a clean 
cookstove, and proud of living a healthy life in terms of 
less consumption of firewood, less smoke and heat, as well as earning money with triple benefit.”
– Indu Jani, Stove T race program participant
StoveT race has been tested and validated in field settings involving approximately 
800 households in rural villages in Uttar Pradesh and Orissa, India. Participating 
families have logged over 210,000 cooking hours on clean cookstoves, saving over 
480 combined metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) and black carbon in CO2 
equivalent. Stove users have been rewarded, thus far, with a combined total of 
about $1,800 in micro-payments, or cash, commensurate with hours of usage. 
Additionally, remittance of carbon credits based on usage has led to increased clean cookstove usage among families.

In September 2015, the United Nations (UN) established the  
17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at achieving 
long-term sustainable development, elimination of poverty and 
an overall healthy planet by 2030. Designed with a bottom-up approach, they help focus government policy, programs, 
innovation and spending. In addition, they help to highlight 
the need for private sector involvement and partnerships for achieving success. Each goal has specific targets to be 
achieved over the next 15 years.
Qualcomm supports the SDGs  
– throughout this report, the SDG  
icons highlight the work we are  
doing across our Company to address these goals by 2030.
