Introduction and reflections. Message from our CEO
As I write this, our world is in a very different place than a year and 
a half ago. The significant loss and upheaval of the pandemic and 
national reckoning with racial injustice have had a tremendous impact 
on our daily lives and how we think about our collective future. 
Some things have not changed. Our company’s purpose is 
creating an airline people love, and our values are to own safety, 
do the right thing, be kind-hearted, deliver performance, and 
be remarkable. This purpose and these values guide our culture 
and business to deliver value for all those who depend on us – 
employees, guests, communities and owners. Especially now, as 
we recover and move forward. 
One month into my role as CEO, and after 17 years with Alaska 
Airlines, I feel a great responsibility to lead us forward. Not only 
to remain a strong and growing company for years to come, but 
one in which every person feels they belong and has opportunity, 
and one that is truly sustainable in our impact on the environment 
and the communities where we fly. And as the newest member of 
the oneworld alliance, I am reminded this impact is felt not only 
individually and locally, but around the globe. 
We spent much of the last year focused on stability, navigating 
through steep financial losses. But we also focused on care: ensuring 
the personal health and safety of our employees and guests, working 
with our labor unions to protect jobs, and listening to and learning 
from our employees about the impact systemic racism has had on 
their lives and families.This theme and focus on care will also guide us moving forward. As 
you will read more about in this report, we are particularly committed 
to care for our people, to advance belonging and racial equity, and to 
care for our planet to reduce our impact on climate change. 
In each of these areas, the last year has been a powerful journey. 
I’ve been personally humbled to recognize how much I needed to 
learn and better understand the injustice and racial biases that Black, 
Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) employees and community 
members face every day. And one of my favorite moments of 2020 
was planting native trees on Oahu as part of our partnership with the 
Hawaiian Legacy Reforestation Initiative in support of Malama (which 
means to “take care”) Hawaii. It was a powerful, hands-on reminder of 
the imperative to protect the native culture, habitat, and environment 
for the places we fly and call home. 
My operations background taught me true change requires transparency 
and accountability, with specific goals and measurements to engrain 
these commitments into our culture. You will read about those goals 
here – they and our values will continue to guide our flight path for the 
next several years so we can continue to thrive for a long time to come.
There is much work yet ahead, but I am more optimistic than ever 
about our journey. Thank you for reading this report, for flying with us, 
for pushing us to always improve, and for joining us on the path to a 
sustainable future for aviation and communities around the world. 
Sincerely, 
Ben Minicucci 
President and CEO
REFLECTIONS ON THE JOURNEY4

Introduction and reflections. 2020 Executive Summary
The other night I flew home to Seattle from Northern 
California, watching the sun glittering across San Francisco 
Bay before disappearing over the Pacific Ocean. I remembered 
writing the introduction to our sustainability report last year 
and noting how much I missed flying, the perspective and 
reflection from being up above the clouds. Looking out from 
32,000 feet, one cannot immediately see the impacts of 
the pandemic, or of the loss and division we have seen and 
experienced over the last year. The vast expanse of the West 
Coast and ocean still look beautiful.
It is beautiful. But up close, we have all felt those impacts – 
economic recession and job loss, illness, disconnection from 
family, violence and hate, wildfires, and more. 2020 was a 
painful year, and the impacts were not equally distributed. 
But we have also learned, listened, changed, laughed, come 
together and even experienced joy. And from all of this, we are 
ready to move forward.
As Ben noted in his reflection, Alaska Airlines has been 
guided this last year by our primary value to focus on safety – 
operational safety, such as personal health and safety, but also 
the safety of belonging, opportunity, and an inclusive culture. Our historic focus on low costs served us well in bringing even 
greater management rigor and liquidity to not only survive the 
unprecedented downturn in revenue, but to emerge ready to 
recover and grow again. Through the last year, the concept of 
sustainability – for people and planet to coexist together, and 
to simply and literally continue for the long term – took on a 
whole new meaning. 
Fittingly, the year was also a pivot point in our sustainability 
work, as we dedicated time with our Board, leadership, and all 
employees to more deeply embed these values in our business 
strategy for the future, with explicit priorities around our 
impact on people, planet, and communities. 
This report is the final disclosure on progress toward our 
2020 voluntary sustainability goals, including where we’ve 
succeeded, where we fell short, what we’ve celebrated and 
what we learned. It is also the first public outline of our areas 
of focus for the next five years. We’ve worked with employees, 
guests and other stakeholders to understand what is most 
important to them, and where we can and must have the 
biggest impact in driving positive and sustainable change.  2020 Performance and Milestones
In 2020, we were proud of several achievements and 
acknowledge areas of significant ongoing work:
•  Putting people and safety first, we achieved our 2020 
goals for safety and seek to maintain our improvement. 
The pandemic also garnered an unforeseen focus on 
personal health and safety, and we launched the Next-
Level Care program with over 100 service changes to 
keep guests healthy – and even more within the operation 
to protect employees from the COVID-19 virus.
•  Serving our community through times of change, 
we surpassed our goal of supporting over 100,000 
young people and workers with education and career 
advancement opportunities. In 2020, our employees 
connected with students virtually about aviation 
operations and careers, wrote letters to seniors in 
quarantine, mentored students within the YMCA's 
Reach and Rise program, and upcycled old uniforms to 
sew and donate masks. We launched and achieved a 
Million Meals Challenge, donating over a million meals 
to community food banks and first responder locations 2020 PROGRESS AND THE PATH AHEAD
We launched the Next-Level Care program with over 100 service changes to keep guests healthy 
– and even more within the operation to protect employees from the COVID-19 virus.5
Introduction and reflections. 2020 Executive Summary
across the country while employees and community 
members matched our contributions with resources and 
food. And the Alaska Airlines Foundation completed the 
largest grant cycle in its 20-year history, delivering more 
than $750,000 to 41 nonprofits in Alaska, California, 
Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington to focus on education, 
equity, and the immediate needs of communities most 
impacted by the pandemic.
•  Ensuring belonging and opportunity in our culture. 
By 2020, we integrated diversity and inclusion initiatives 
into our four largest workgroups. And we rallied 
together to address the challenges of COVID-19. But 
most importantly, with input from our employees, we 
recognized how much work we have yet to do to ensure 
belonging and equitable opportunity for all. This is a 
focus for our 2025 commitment and goals. 
•  Reducing our environmental impact is a tale of two 
eras – pre-COVID, and during COVID. Prior to the 
COVID pandemic, we were on the path to realizing our 
greenhouse gas emission and inflight waste goals. We 
achieved our goal of halving paper consumption per 
flight since 2012, but the coronavirus pandemic led to 
suspending inflight recycling due to safety concerns 
of touching material to sort, and to flying more empty 
aircraft through the bulk of 2020 which significantly 
worsened carbon efficiency. Still, we used the year to 
re-set for the future. We announced a first-of-its kind 
agreement with Microsoft to create “renewable routes” 
for Microsoft employees flying from Seattle to our hubs in California, using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from 
SkyNRG. With 80% lower carbon footprint on a lifecycle 
basis, sustainable aviation fuel is critical on the path to 
decarbonization, and we are excited to be a catalyst for 
this effort. This will be a significant area of focus for our 
2025 goals and beyond. 
Building on our history of energy stewardship in our buildings 
and operation, we opened two new LEED buildings in the last 
two years, a new maintenance hangar in Anchorage in 2018 
and an Employee Hub in SeaTac, WA in 2020.
I am deeply grateful to the employees of Alaska and Horizon 
for their resilience, ingenuity, and more in the face of profound 
challenges over the last fifteen months. Our labor partners 
were also essential in working with us to preserve jobs and 
keep our people safe while taking care of our guests. 
 Focus Forward
Our purpose of creating an airline people love means doubling 
down on our commitment to employees, guests, and the 
planet. Despite the headwinds of the last year, the pandemic 
sharpened our focus for a stronger path forward. 
As we move forward, we will share progress on all 2025 
goals outlined in this report. And since clear priorities 
enable better results, we have a particularly intense focus 
on advancing inclusion and racial equity and reducing our 
climate impact.To make this a reality, we developed specific and measurable 
goals for 2025, and share those, and the work behind them, 
with you here.
Our most pressing first task is returning safely to pre-pandemic 
level operations. This means ensuring our employees and the 
people who fly with us feel safe and confident onboard and 
in traveling with us again, broadening our reach as we joined 
the oneworld international alliance, and ensuring a strong, 
sustainable, and growing future for the jobs and families 
that our company supports. And it means holding ourselves 
publicly accountable to our goals. We care for people and the 
planet, and we’re going to show our work.
I suspect I’ll always love to fly – not as an escape from the 
ground-level realities, but as a chance to gain perspective, a 
reminder to pick up my head, appreciate the beautiful planet 
we occupy, and take the long view. It’s part of why I work at 
Alaska Airlines, to share a passion for flying and to help ensure 
that the incredible value it brings to people and communities 
endures for generations through these commitments to make 
flying matter. I hope you’ll join us in this journey. 
Sincerely,  
Diana Birkett Rakow  
VP, Public Affairs and 
Sustainability

Sustainability goal summary. 2020 Progress and Results
WRAPPING UP 2020 GOALS
In 2013, we announced a set of goals to carry us forward 
through 2020. After seven years of progress, challenges 
overcome, and a mid-course goals adjustment in 2017, we 
are excited this year to announce a new set of 2025 goals.
Our 2020 goals were grounded in building a lasting 
business, caring for the planet, and serving our 
stakeholders: our employees, our guests, and the 
communities where we live and work. Overall, we report 
successful results. Where we fell short, there were some 
common themes such as navigating a merger that was 
not included in the original goal-setting process, and, 
especially, a global pandemic. However, these setbacks 
have served as valuable lessons learned that have informed 
our goal-setting process for the future and redefined the 
trajectory of what we believe is possible. We are in this for 
the long-haul and our successes and failures both provide 
the foundation of our progress for the next five years.
The 2020 goals are listed in the chart below, but there 
are important lessons in each subject area that should be 
highlighted for their importance in shaping our approach 
moving forward.
 Environment
In 2013 we defined our environmental goals based on 
emissions and waste, which represent our most significant sources of negative impact on the planet. In 2017, we 
refined these goals following our merger with Virgin 
America. Our performance against these goals was 
challenged in 2020, in part due to the pandemic.
We know that aviation has a significant impact on the 
amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced globally 
every year and reducing our portion of that impact remains 
our top priority. While we did not hit our 2020 marks 
for emissions reductions, the biggest factor in this was 
our acquisition of Virgin America, which immediately 
expanded our fleet with less efficient planes that hurt our 
per-mile performance. We adjusted our target at the time 
of the acquisition (from a 20% improvement to 17%), and 
we were close by 2019. But we fell well short in 2020 
due to the upheaval from the pandemic. This is a per-
passenger (and cargo) measurement and flying mostly 
empty planes was a massive negative impact. However, 
we are in the process of upgrading our entire fleet of 
planes and replacing for the most fuel-efficient Boeing 
aircraft, meaning that more planes in the sky will be flying 
to Alaska’s standard of efficiency. And, returning to more 
normal load-factors (how full our planes are) will reverse 
most of this negative trend.
Likewise, our inflight waste goals fell just short as our 
industry-leading inflight recycling program had to be halted 
during the global pandemic for safety purposes. This served 
7
Sustainability goal summary. 2020 Progress and Results
as a good example of how our 2020 goals met unexpected 
realities along the way and how that reality placed our number 
one priority, safety, into conflict with our waste goals. The 
measure was not met, but our top priority of keeping our 
people safe was. And we continued our #FillBeforeYouFly 
program to encourage guests to bring personal, reusable 
water bottles to save materials use onboard.
 People
Taking care of people goes back to our roots in the state of 
Alaska where taking care of your neighbors and community 
defined the culture that gave us our beginning. We built our 
2020 goals on these values, focusing on key metrics such 
as employee engagement to measure the growing strength 
of our culture. Although our final scores did not meet the 
numbers we set out to reach, the events of the past several 
years reflect deeper growth and more positive results than is 
reflected in the numbers.
Our merger with Virgin America in 2016 changed the 
trajectory of our employee engagement scores in ways we 
could not have expected when we announced our goals, but the process of merging two companies ultimately 
strengthened our culture in ways not reflected by the 
numbers. Merging companies and bringing labor contracts 
together is hard, but the process solidified our values, 
clarified our purpose, and focused our people in new and 
powerful ways in our path forward to becoming one team 
with a stronger commitment to our values and the future of 
our business.
The global pandemic presented another unexpected 
challenge that impacted all of us in different ways, but 
brought us together. When faced with this new adversity, 
we worked with employees to create our Next-Level 
Care safety standard to stay safe during the pandemic, 
while offering a structured safety incentive plan for 
our employees to continue relentlessly pursuing safety 
throughout the pandemic. We focused on preserving 
jobs, communicating transparently and often with our 
people, and providing support to lessen the impact of 
the pandemic on employees. These steps strengthened 
employee engagement, and we rallied together to get 
through the pandemic.The events of the last year also deepened our focus, 
discussions, and work on racial equity. Alaska has a long history 
of advancing diversity and inclusion values and goals, but this 
year forced us to listen and learn more deeply. Based on input 
from our employees, we developed new commitments to racial 
equity, and renewed our commitment to a culture of inclusion, 
enabling Alaska and Horizon to be a place where everyone feels 
they belong. We have much work ahead and are committed 
to continued learning, and to action and sustained change.
 Looking Forward
Results on our 2020 goals shaped our trajectory toward 
our next destination – 2025. Caring for the planet led us to 
set bolder goals for carbon emissions reductions, seek to 
change the market for sustainable fuels, and lead the industry 
in waste reduction and recycling. Our caring for employees, 
guests and communities led us to launch initiatives to serve 
people dealing with natural disasters, provide a million 
meals during the pandemic, transport personal protective 
equipment (PPE) and medical supplies, fly medical staff to 
areas in the most need, and, most importantly, to magnify 
our commitment to diversity and inclusion.
Caring for the planet led us to set bolder goals for carbon emissions reductions, 
seek to change the market for sustainable fuels, and lead the industry in waste 
reduction and recycling. 8

2025: OUR FOCUS FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS
Our 2025 goals are not simply a statement 
of values, they are a statement of action and 
accountable commitments we believe are essential 
to creating an airline people love. 
While the COVID-19 pandemic meant prioritizing 
immediate action on safety and the survival of our 
business, we also laid groundwork for the long-term work 
outlined here. We know our future depends not only on 
how we care for our people and business but also on how 
we care for the health of the planet and the communities 
where we live and fly. We remain guided by our values 
and the most pressing areas we can impact, to generate 
meaningful progress on caring for people and the planet.
We believe that as part of running a fundamentally 
sustainable business, our goals must become embedded, 
living commitments to drive real and meaningful 
reductions to carbon emissions and advancements in 
racial equity that engage our guests, employees, and other 
stakeholders in our progress.
PLANET  
Stewarding our Carbon, Waste, and Water 
Our biggest impact on the climate comes from greenhouse 
gas emissions produced from burning fuel. That’s why we’ve 
prioritized this work – to burn and emit less fuel, to employ greener alternatives, and ultimately to transform aviation 
for a more sustainable future. We also developed goals and 
strategies to reduce our waste and water impact on the 
planet and invited guests along on the journey.
Specifically, we are setting both short and long-term goals 
to address our climate impact. Alaska is committed to 
regaining its position as the top US airline in fuel efficiency 
while maintaining carbon-neutral growth through 2025. 
We have instituted a metric of carbon efficiency in our all-
employee incentive pay plan, because we know that what 
gets measured gets managed. Near-term improvements 
in reducing fuel use will come largely from replacing older 
aircraft as we bring the Boeing 737 MAX into our fleet and 
using technology and best practices to continue improving 
the fuel efficiency of our operations. 
We are also setting our course for net zero carbon 
footprint by 2040. Achieving this goal will require the use 
of sustainable aviation fuels, implementing new aviation 
technologies, and investing in credible high-quality 
carbon offsets to close any remaining gap. Succeeding 
on this course cannot be achieved alone; it will also 
require support and partnership from government and the 
aviation industry to ensure that more sustainable fuel and 
technology alternatives are both commercially viable and 
available at a cost and scale that can keep the benefits of 
aviation accessible for communities and consumers. 
11
Sustainability goal summary. 2025 Goals
As we recover from COVID-19, we also look forward 
to returning to our industry-leading inflight recycling 
program and working with our supply chain on more 
sustainable alternatives for onboard service – fewer 
single use items and less plastic. And as we have 
for the last few years, we will restore as much water 
as we use through investments in local habitat for 
salmon, whales, and other parts of the ecosystem that 
support and connect the places we live and fly. 
PEOPLE  
Cultivating safe and strong places to  
work, live, and fly  
Throughout the last year, we spent considerable time 
listening to and learning from our employees across 
the company to understand the impacts of systemic 
racism on them, their families, and their work at 
Alaska and Horizon. 
The conversations have been powerful, at times 
painful and uncomfortable, and humbling. We have 
come to better appreciate that racial equity is a 
human rights issue at the heart of our business, and 
that we can and must do better to advance racial 
equity in our company and communities. Alaska and 
Horizon stand against hate, intolerance, and racism 
of any kind, and we are guided by our values to “be 
kind-hearted and do the right thing.” Our guests 
should always feel welcome on board, and our OUR WORKFORCE PROFILE FOR RACE / ETHNICITY AND GENDER

Our racial equity goals are focused on increasing the diversity of our leadership team at the Director and above levels 
where we have the most opportunity. We believe our leadership team should at minimum reflect the diversity of our 
broader employee base.
We will also continue to support and advance all communities and identities. We believe if we focus on 
belonging and address the process, systems and structures that support mitigating bias, being inclusive, and 
building allyship, everyone will benefit. RACE / 
ETHNICITY12
Sustainability goal summary. 2025 Goals
employees deserve to feel safe and a sense of belonging 
when they come to work. Guided by employees, we 
established commitments and goals – which you will see 
specifically outlined below – in three areas:
• Representation: Increasing the racial diversity of 
our leadership 
• Culture: Cultivating an inclusive culture so 
employees feel welcomed and that they belong, 
and
• Public Leadership: Working with community-
based organizations to positively impact the lives 
of young people through education and career 
development.
We are expanding our programs for outreach, 
recruiting, and career pathways to cultivate and 
support truly diverse talent, and continue to work 
closely with our employee Business Resource Groups 
and external partners to learn and improve. 
We will also work to develop a supplier diversity 
program in the next two years, learning from best 
practices across industry. To reinforce the priority 
of all this work, a portion of our long-term executive 
compensation will depend on advancing diversity, 
equity, and inclusion within the company.
We remain focused on safety as our number one value, 
including the Next-Level Care program established to protect personal health and safety through the 
coronavirus pandemic, and will measure and manage 
our continued performance in three areas:
• Running a safe operation with robust safety 
management and reporting systems
• Maintaining safety as the top priority among 
employees, and 
• Maintaining a favorable perception of safety  
among guests. 
And we will continue to support productive 
relationships with our labor unions to support 
employees and solve problems together, community 
involvement amongst employees, best practice crisis 
management, responsible political engagement, 
consumer privacy and data security, and rigorous 
financial management.
 Our Approach 
To develop the 2025 goals shared in these pages, 
we worked with a diverse group of stakeholders 
inside and outside the company to assess our most 
significant impacts, identify issues most important to our 
employees and guests, and evaluate industry and cross-
industry best practices. We benchmarked ourselves 
against industry and non-industry counterparts 
on measures being tracked and evaluated by key 
stakeholders. We have chosen a five-year timeframe to 
be long enough for progress, while short enough to be 
clear and measurable in today’s rapidly changing world. 
13
Sustainability goal summary. 2025 Goals
Each goal is tied to specific measures we will use to hold 
ourselves publicly accountable, sharing annually what 
we care about and how we are performing against our 
expectations and targets. 
These goals reflect our responsibility to help keep 
the places we live and fly beautiful and viable for our kids, grandchildren and generations to come; and our 
commitment to creating an inclusive environment in which 
everyone feels they belong. 
We continue to call our sustainability program 'LIFT', 
inspired by the foundational force of physics that enables 
airplanes to leave the ground. Lift enables us to fly, and we do so with care in every part of what we do: care for safety, 
for our guests, for each other, and for the world around us. 
Our 2025 goals are not simply a statement of values, they 
are a statement of action and accountable commitments we 
believe are essential to creating an airline people love. We 
have lengthy runway in front of us, are excited to share this 
route map, and remain committed to the journey ahead.

SASB CLIMATE NARRATIVE
 Management and Governance of  
Climate-Related Issues:
Our Sustainability and ESG team uses multiple avenues 
to identify and evaluate climate risks, including input 
from employees, investors, governments, NGOs, 
reporting organizations, trade associations, and key 
stakeholders within and outside of the aviation industry.
Our Executive Committee of senior management 
engaged in education on sustainability issues and 
the company included sustainability education in 
employees’ annual compliance training. Climate risks 
and opportunities factor into key business decisions, 
such as fleet decisions and fuel efficiency.
 Board Governance:
The full Board has given guidance that sustainability and 
ESG be leading parts of our company strategy and have 
regular discussions about this work including specific to 
climate impact. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee of the 
Board is responsible for overseeing the company’s 
practices and reporting with respect to the breadth of ESG matters, including voluntary ESG goals and 
disclosure, annual reporting, and environmental and 
climate impacts. This Committee includes members 
with deep experience in energy and environmental 
impact from two different industries, as well as in 
governance, safety, and risk. These perspectives and 
those of the full Board drive robust oversight of our ESG 
strategy and initiatives. In early 2021, the Board created 
a dedicated Carbon Working Group to work with 
management on climate goals and progress.
The Governance and Nominating Committee reviews 
our ESG / sustainability performance quarterly, 
including our performance on enterprise-wide publicly 
reported sustainability goals and climate-related issues. 
Other board committees receive relevant updates 
on issues such as CORSIA, and climate risks that 
may elevate through our enterprise risk management 
program. Alaska’s enterprise-wide risk analysis and 
oversight program is designed to identify the various 
risks faced by the organization, assign responsibility for 
managing those risks to individual executives as well 
as align these risks with Board oversight. The Safety 
Committee receives regular updates on environmental 
risk, and the Compensation and Leadership Development is responsible for oversight of advancing 
diversity, equity, and inclusion in our employee 
population including recruitment, hiring, retention, 
development, and culture.  
At a management level, a member of our Executive 
Committee has formal responsibility for driving 
progress and disclosure in Sustainability and ESG. 
And because this work is inherently cross-functional, 
we have also formalized governance and oversight 
of ESG at the management level. An ESG Executive 
Steering Committee meets monthly for oversight 
of performance and work toward our goals and is 
responsible for ensuring progress. Additional Steering 
Committees focused on reducing carbon emissions 
and advancing racial equity, respectively, bring explicit 
focus and reports progress to the ESG Executive 
Steering Committee. Finally, a group dedicated to our 
ESG Goals and Disclosure ensure that we’re bringing 
appropriate stewardship and transparency in our data to 
the breadth of ESG matters. These groups are staffed 
by senior executives across all areas of accountability for 
delivering on ESG – including operations, finance, human 
resources, legal, commercial divisions, government 
affairs, philanthropy, and more. 
Climate risks and opportunities factor into key business decisions, such as fleet decisions and fuel efficiency.24
Appendix. SASB Climate Narrative
 Climate Strategy:
Alaska’s most material sustainability priority is reducing 
our carbon emissions from jet fuel. Jet fuel is over 
99% of our direct climate footprint and represents 
our second largest expense as a company. Because of 
this direct tie to expenses and Alaska’s management 
focus on low costs to enable low fares, Alaska has had 
a multi-decade focus on increasing the fuel efficiency 
of our fleet (“what we fly”) and on developing and 
deploying new technologies to optimize our routes 
and minimizing fuel use in our taxiing and using 
preconditioned air at our gates (“how we fly”). In 
addition, Alaska has a decade of leadership in piloting 
and pioneering low-carbon sustainable aviation fuels 
(SAF), directly supporting the development and 
deployment of the SAF market in partnership with 
many key organizations (“the fuel we use”). 
In addition, as a member of the International Air 
Transport Association (IATA) and Airlines for America 
(A4A), and the oneworld alliance, we are working 
alongside other airlines to address the challenge of 
climate change. We have adopted a set of global 
targets to mitigate CO2 emissions from air transport, 
and are working to meet these goals through: 
1. Improved technology, including the deployment 
and more local availability and manufacturing of 
sustainable low-carbon fuels 2. More efficient aircraft operations 
3. Infrastructure improvements, including 
modernized air traffic management systems 
4. A single global market-based measure to fill the 
remaining emissions gap on international routes 
(CORSIA).
Alaska Airlines began setting and tracking progress 
to a voluntary climate goal a decade ago, and our 
2020 climate goal was to reduce our aircraft carbon 
emissions by 17% per revenue-ton mile (RTM) in 
2020, from our 2009 baseline. We were nearing 
this goal in 2019, but the unprecedented change 
in air travel in 2020 meant we missed the goal 
significantly for our final year. More detail is in the 
goals section of this 2020 LIFT Report, as well as 
a listing of our 2025 and beyond climate goals that 
chart our direction on climate moving forward.
 Transparency and Disclosure:
We annually report our greenhouse gas impact in 
our LIFT Report, as well as submitting our climate 
metrics to the CDP. For CORSIA, we have submitted 
our baseline calculation and are assessing efficiency 
and offset options.25
Appendix. SASB Climate Narrative
OUR CLIMATE INVESTMENTS
 What we fly:
We fly an efficient fleet and have invested in efficiency 
where possible. In 2017 we finalized installation of 
split scimitar winglets on all our eligible 737 aircraft, 
improving average fuel efficiency by over 34,000 gallons 
per aircraft each year. Aircraft fitted with split scimitar 
winglets are 3-5% more fuel efficient than those without 
winglets. In 2019, the scimitar winglets modification 
saved approximately 4.5 million gallons of fuel. Our 
recent announcement to purchase sixty-eight 737 MAX 
aircraft will reduce our per passenger CO2 significantly 
over the airplanes they are replacing.
 How we fly: 
We continue to use RNP approaches and departures 
where possible. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) 
is a performance-based navigation technique that uses 
a combination of onboard navigation technology and 
the GPS satellite network to fly safer, more reliable 
approaches. For years, we’ve advocated to expand the use of RNP technologies to airports across the 
country and to enable broader air traffic infrastructure to 
support that goal. RNP technologies save an estimated 
1.2 million gallons of fuel annually due to reduced track 
miles. We also continued our Arrival Fuel Program that 
encourages smart choices that optimize the use of fuel 
when planning and selecting alternate landing sites. 
Through this, we save an estimated 300,000 gallons of 
fuel annually. 
 The fuel we use: 
We continue to build strong partnerships with industry 
leaders in the sustainable aviation fuels arena. We 
are working with the airports, other industry leaders, 
local and state government representatives, and major 
producers to develop the strategy for a sustainable fuels 
path for SeaTac, San Francisco and other airports on the 
West Coast. We have partnership agreements with the 
Port of Seattle, San Francisco airport, and sustainable 
aviation fuel companies Neste and SkyNRG Americas 
and have supported public policy proposals that would 
support the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). We use SAF on an ongoing basis at San Francisco 
and were one of the three airlines that launched this 
offtake. Procuring SAF that is priced competitively with 
traditional fuel has been difficult. We are searching for 
the best ways to obtain the volume of fuel that we need 
at the right price. In the meantime, we continue to make 
progress by partnering with alternative fuel companies, 
stakeholder groups, and industry steering committees to 
accelerate innovation.
 Additional efforts:
We also look beyond the impact of jet fuel to 
greenhouse gas emission reductions in other aspects 
of our operations and corporate footprint. For example, 
we partner with airports on the adoption and growth 
of the use of electric ground-service equipment and 
other efforts that require collaborative effort. In addition, 
we pursue green building and energy efficiency in our 
building footprint including LEED certification for new 
buildings and retrofitting existing buildings with more 
energy-efficient lighting and technology. 
We look beyond our impact of jet fuel and pursue other greenhouse gas emissions reductions 
in other aspects of our aviation operations, as well as in other areas of our corporate footprint.26
Appendix. SASB Safety Narrative
 Alaska Air Group Safety Narrative for SASB:
Safety is the foundation of everything we do and remains 
our top priority. We have an unwavering commitment to 
run a safe operation, and we will not compromise this 
commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives. Alaska and 
Horizon were the first U.S. major airlines to receive FAA 
validation and acceptance of their Safety Management 
System (SMS) in 2016, and we are at the continuous 
improvement level. 
Report It!, our mobile safety reporting application, makes it 
easier for employees to file safety reports. Alaska has been 
on the IOSA registration audit since 2005. In early 2021, 
we were the leading US airline on the AirlineRatings.com 
list of the world's Top 20 safest airlines. 
We believe that maintaining safe operations, through 
adherence to well-defined processes and ensuring 
every Air Group employee is aware of their individual 
contribution to our operation, is critical to on-time 
performance. The rigor we apply to running a safe 
operation has resulted in Alaska consistently being 
one of the top airlines in North America for on-time 
performance; and Horizon was recognized again as the 
leader in on-time performance among regional airlines.
 Management and Governance of Safety:
Our Safety Management System (SMS) utilizes multiple 
levels of performance review in all areas of the company to create visibility to hazards, safety risk, and ensure 
management accountability with mitigation controls and 
corrective action plans. The SMS uses multiple safety 
assurance systems to identify hazards and continuously 
evaluate the control environment to ensure the highest 
margins for repeatable safety performance. 
Our Executive Committee of senior management review 
safety quarterly with our VP of Safety and Security. Our 
Executive Safety Review Board also occurs quarterly, 
attended by all of operational VPs and COO. These meetings 
are intended to analyze safety performance and to discuss 
continued improve our safety culture and process. Safety 
risks and opportunities factor into key business decisions.
The Safety committee of the Alaska Air Group (AAG) 
Board reviews our safety performance quarterly, including 
our performance on enterprise-wide safety goals. 
Alaska’s enterprise-wide risk analysis and oversight 
program is designed to identify the various risks faced by 
the organization, assign responsibility for managing those 
risks to individual executives as well as align these risks 
with Board oversight. 
 Goals: 
For 2020 our goals were to increase employee safety 
reporting by 26% over 2017 baseline (reports per 
employee) and decrease medium risk (3+) safety events 
by 20%. We had 8 medium safety risk events in 2020: a reduction of 20% compared to 2017, and employee safety 
reporting is well past our goal and is up 55% over our 2017 
baseline. AAG performed 781 safety risk assessments in 
2020 and identified 1,434 hazards. Out of the 1,434 hazards 
identified, 80% (1,148) of the hazards required mitigation. 
And 2,226 mitigation actions have been assigned.
In addition, as a member of the Airlines for America 
(A4A), we have active representation on the Safety 
Council with all other US major airlines in order to 
develop strategies to address systemic safety issues 
through continuous improvement of safety management 
systems and collaboration with FAA and other aviation 
stakeholders. The council guides annual initiative targets 
to improve safety risks to include: 
1. Cross-carrier collaboration on flight operations, cabin 
operations, ground operations, and maintenance risk 
mitigation procedures
2. Ensuring active flight data monitoring and reporting 
systems of airline operations
3. Reducing injuries through improved procedures, 
training, and technology
4. Reducing aircraft ground damage through innovative 
ground service equipment technology, procedures, 
and training
5. Data sharing of safety risks across safety 
management systemsSASB SAFETY NARRATIVE27
