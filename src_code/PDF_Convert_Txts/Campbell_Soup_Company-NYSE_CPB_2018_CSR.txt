CEO MESSAGE
For the last two years, I began my 
comments to you by sharing our Purpose—Real food that matters for life’s moments. This year is no different, because, at Campbell, living our Purpose is so integral to everything we do. It has fundamentally altered the way we think, talk and act about our food, and has led us to take principled position on the most pressing issues facing the food industry. 
Each day, the food industry is challenged 
by seismic shifts that are changing our consumer food and retail landscapes. These changes include:
• Shifting demographics on an unprecedented scale;
• Evolving consumer preferences toward health, fresh and “real food”; 
• Cutting-edge technologies that are reshaping customer shopping experiences;• Rapidly evolving retailer and foodservice landscapes; and, 
• Navigating today’s socio-economic forces. 
Health and well-being means different things to different people. Many Millennials, and now Generation Z consumers, are focused on health and well-being; and it’s where many aging Baby Boomers are headed as they, too, seek a better quality of life. In the last six years, we’ve made an unwavering commitment to move Campbell in the direction of the consumer’s definition  of health and well-being. 
In 2017, we declared our goal: to be 
the leading health and well-being food company. It is an ambitious goal—one that not only includes the foods, beverages and snacks we make, but Dear Campbell Stakeholders,
“We’ve made an unwavering commitment 
to move Campbell in the direction of  
the consumer’s definition of health and 
well-being.”

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AT CAMPBELL
2017 Calendar Year RecognitionsCEO Message, cont.
also embraces the well-being of our 
local communities and our planet. 
To strengthen our commitment to 
corporate responsibility, we are launching an expanded set of measurable goals. These goals will help us drive continual improvement as we grow, source, produce and share our food into the future. By 2025, we are committing to responsibly source 100 percent of our priority raw materials and establish traceability to the country of origin; source 50 percent (by volume) of plant-based priority ingredients from suppliers engaged in an approved sustainable agriculture program; and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations by 25 percent. 
Our corporate responsibility 
commitments hold us accountable to a sustainable environment, to quality food and, ultimately, to you. At Campbell, the most important ingredient in our foods—your trust—can’t be found on a label. We make food that we are proud to serve in our own homes, and we work hard every day to earn trust. We believe that:
• Transparency builds trust. Consumers have a right to know what is in their food. Campbell is setting the standard for transparency in the food industry. We are leading the industry in GMO labeling and have created resources like www.whatsinmyfood.com where consumers can find detailed information on our leading products.
• Real food has roots. Consumers should know that we strive to use recognizable, desirable ingredients  to make our food. 
• Real food is prepared with care. Consumers should feel confident that their food is responsibly crafted using ethical sourcing and sustainable practices that safeguard our natural resources. We are leading the food industry on sustainable agriculture, clean water and responsible waste management. In fact, through the Consumer Goods Forum, we are committed to halving our food waste by 2030.
• Real food should be accessible to all. Food should always be delicious, safe and available at a fair price—all three, without compromise. That’s why we’re thinking and acting differently about our food and helping restore consumers’ connection to food. 
We strive to meet a higher standard, and we want you to expect that from us. We are committed to earning and keeping your trust, but we can only accomplish that by doing business in a way that is transparent, authentic and meaningful  
to you.
Best,
Denise M. Morrison
President and Chief Executive Officer

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AT CAMPBELLSTRATEGY
Our sustainability strategy reflects our Purpose to provide Real food that matters for life’s moments and our strong 
commitment to transparency in the decisions we make and the actions we take. During our annual formal strategic planning 
process in FY2017, we revised our sustainability strategy to more closely align with our value chain and to support our business intent to be the leading health and well-being food company. This new framework reflects how we grow, source, produce and share our food. 
We developed this strategy with major food industry trends in mind. Global population growth, water scarcity, climate change 
and constraints on agricultural land are placing massive strain on the food system. A growing number of people lack ready access to good, affordable food, while food-related health issues such as obesity and diabetes continue to rise. At the same time, demographic shifts are producing a base of aging consumers interested in foods that can help them manage chronic diseases, and a younger generation that craves food that suits their active, wellness-focused lifestyles. Both changes add up to an increased focus on health and well-being, and Campbell is rising to meet this demand. We are not only developing healthier products—we’re being more transparent about how our food is grown and produced and where we stand on issues that matter, like animal welfare and mandatory labeling of GMOs. 
Our Vision
We strive to build a more res ilient 
food system, maki ng real food that

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AT CAMPBELLStrategic Foresight Into the Future
Throughout the year, we maintain dialogue with our suppliers, customers, NGOs and investors to monitor and assess 
emerging issues and the evolution of the topics in Campbell’s materiality assessment. Over the past year, we engaged a broad cross-section of Campbell leaders in developing an actionable, enterprise-wide view of the future of food. More specifically, we sought to define disruptions and opportunities in the five- to seven-year horizon within the areas of real  
food and food and technology. 
We gathered and synthesized marketplace, consumer, culinary and technology trends, and conducted extensive interviews 
with futurists, academics, chefs, designers, nutritionists and anthropologists. The themes identified represent an emerging pattern of change that combines and categorizes internal stakeholder perspectives, external influences and broader strategic drivers. These platforms cut across real food, technology and sustainability and are informing our decision making.
The platforms, which include Future Commerce, My.Moments (snacking), Limitless Local, Better.Me (personalized nutrition), 
Bio(Diverse) Sources, Connected Culinary Experiences, Clean AgTech and Purposeful Regeneration, bring together the disruptors, drivers, trends and signals existing across social, technological, economic, environmental, political and values-driven contexts.
To build and extend organizational competency for strategic foresight, we have developed a curriculum and an active 
learning model for Campbell employees, which we call our Sparkplug training program. The program equips employees  to spark the adoption of a future focus into our strategies for the coming years.Strategy, cont.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AT CAMPBELLEthics
Everything we do at Campbell reflects our strong foundation of ethical business practices. This foundation allows us to 
attract and retain talented people who share our values, and also reduces the potential for risk or reputational damage. We pride ourselves on having built an ethical company where employees are proud to work. 
Campbell’s compliance and ethics program, Winning With Integrity, reflects our conviction that conducting business in 
compliance with the law and the highest standards of business ethics is essential to our success. As reflected in our Code 
of Business Conduct and Ethics, employees share responsibility for ensuring that the Winning With Integrity principles are fulfilled every day, through each and every action taken—whether in the marketplace, the workplace or the community.
The Code outlines our company’s basic standards and expectations, highlights important policies and summarizes certain 
fundamental legal requirements that employees must follow. Each employee receives a copy of the Code, which is available in multiple languages, and participates in training annually. We review the Code on an annual basis. The most recently updated version was approved by the CEO and the Board of Directors, announced and distributed to employees in their language of choice and posted on the company’s internal and external websites.
Campbell’s Legal Department is responsible for maintaining and administering the Winning With Integrity program. 
The Vice President–Corporate Compliance/Deputy General Counsel has overall responsibility for the direction and 
administration of the program and has direct access to the Chair of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for all compliance-related matters. A full report on the program is presented to the Audit Committee on an annual basis.Governance, cont.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AT CAMPBELLMATERIALITY
Material corporate responsibility issues are those topics that influence the judgment and decisions of our external 
and internal stakeholders, as well as having an impact on them and our business. We identify and prioritize material corporate responsibility issues through the four-step assessment process below.
Step 1: Identify Issues–We review the priorities publicly reported by our peers, conduct a media audit of trending issues  
and discuss issues with NGOs and investors.Step 2: Survey Stakeholders–We send the survey to employees, customers, suppliers, NGOs, community partners, 
government or regulatory agencies, investors, trade organizations and consumers, and post it publicly on social media.  
More than 1,250 participants responded to our most recent survey.
Step 3: Interview Stakeholders–We conduct interviews internally with global employees and external stakeholders. In 
addition, as part of our most recent assessment, Sustainable Brands interviewed five internal stakeholders, and Business  for Social Responsibility interviewed five external stakeholders. 
Step 4: Validate–Campbell’s Sustainability Steering Committee and various leaders around the organization provide feedback 
on the issues and validate the results of the research, survey and interview process. The results are shared below, and are reevaluated and revalidated throughout the year to allow for the inclusion of major or minor shifts in issues of priority.

15 2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTHow We Manage Metrics That Matter1
We believe that real food has roots. It should be made with 
recognizable, desirable ingredients from plants or animals. 
Real food is also prepared with care, which includes how our 
ingredients are grown. These beliefs are nothing new; our 
company has worked closely with local and regional farmers 
since our earliest days. 
Today, as the world’s population grows—and along with it, the 
demand for land, water and food—we’re increasingly aware that the capacity of our current agricultural system is finite. Adding to this uncertainty are the potential risks to the food system posed by a changing climate. For these reasons and more, we are working to optimize agricultural supply chains to ensure their resilience in an increasingly volatile and changing environment.
Farming itself is responsible for significant environmental 
impacts. Crop irrigation is often the largest contributor to a food product’s water footprint, and fertilizer production and use is often the largest contributor to its GHG footprint. Today’s consumers understand these issues and have demonstrated  that they will consider how a product was grown when they choose what foods to eat. 
That’s why Campbell is driving responsible and resilient 
agriculture to protect the long-term viability of the farms and ecosystems from which we source our ingredients. To better achieve these goals, we appointed a Director of Sustainable Agriculture and a Sustainable Agriculture Analyst in FY2017. Leveraging this new team, we are helping secure natural resources and livelihoods on farms by sharing the latest knowledge on sustainable and precision agriculture, promoting adoption of more efficient practices industry-wide, and investing in agricultural innovations and data analytics. This helps our farmers make better-informed decisions about how to manage their land and helps Campbell be more transparent with consumers about the full scope of our impacts. 
Real food begins on the farm. We’re doing our part to ensure 
that growers can keep growing, so we can continue sharing real food for generations to come. NITROGEN USE

Farming has always required a precise 
understanding of many variables: water and nutrient levels, soil quality and sunlight. Farmers judged when to plant and how to care for their crops, using knowledge passed down by generations before them and intuition refined by years of experience. 
Now, the tools at farmers’ disposal are 
significantly more advanced. Sensors, drones, data analytics software and other technologies allow for precision agriculture, giving farmers more detailed information more easily. This helps them provide exactly what their crops need when they need it. 
With a farming history dating back 
more than 100 years, Bolthouse Farms understands the traditional ways of tending to a field, but is also embracing new technologies through investment in precision agriculture tools that are delivering higher yields and more efficient use of natural resources.Tradition Meets Technology at Bolthouse Farms

Grows Better Carrots  
More SustainablyPlanting seeds varying 
distances apart yields 
differently shaped carrots. 
We sell thick carrots whole 
and slice narrow ones into 
baby-cut size.
A specialized 
machine uses 
electroconductivity 
to map soil types 
so we can optimize 
planting and 
apply variable and 
accurate levels 
of crop nutrients 
across a field.
Pest control advisors visit fields 
frequently to assess what pests 
are present and how to address 
them in a responsible manner 
to avoid unnecessary pesticide 
applications.A fleet of GPS-
driven tractors, 
planters, harvesters 
and accompanying 
equipment ensures 
that carrots are 
planted in straight 
rows, allowing 
nearly every carrot 
to be harvested. 
This not only 
reduces waste 
but makes more 
efficient use of our 
resources.By removing more dirt 
from carrots during 
harvest, we leave 
more soil in the field 
and limit the weight of 
carrot loads trucked 
from the fields—which 
in turn reduces fuel 
consumption, water 
needed to clean the 
carrots and waste at 
the plant.We evaluate our seed 
choices every year, testing 
new varieties to see what 
works best.
Carrot tissue samples 
allow us to monitor 
nutrient levels and make 
science-based decisions 
about the optimal amount 
of inputs, like nitrogen, 
to apply throughout the

As part of our effort to support our 
farmers in developing sustainable 
growing practices and drive environ -
mental improvement, Campbell collects data from our tomato growers and pro-vides report cards back to them that benchmark their resource use compared to their peers within Campbell’s family of growers. We also connect tomato farmers to educational materials and the latest research, including information on how to use fertilizer more efficiently and how to apply for grants to fund drip irrigation systems that conserve water. 
While our tomato growers use 
sophisticated technology to collect data about their own operations, Campbell’s report cards allow them to see how their efforts stack up against other growers like them. This transparency provides invaluable insight and encourages strong collaborations between Campbell and our farmers—which leads to more sustainable growing practices and financial benefits for farmers. 
Report Cards Extend All the Way to the Farm 
In 2012, we set a goal to reduce GHG emissions from nitrogen use per tonne of tomatoes by 20 percent and reduce water use per pound of tomatoes by 20 percent by the end of 2020. We’re proud to share that we met both of these goals ahead of schedule and are setting additional sustainable agriculture goals in FY2018. Our farmers continue to invest in drip irrigation technologies to meet our third goal of reducing nitrogen applied per pound of tomatoes by 10 percent. Drip irrigation can more precisely deliver nitrogen to the plant, reducing the risk of nutrient runoff that can pollute waterways. In FY2017, 69 percent of acres farmed for Campbell tomatoes used drip irrigation systems. In FY2015, we extended these commitments to include additional priority ingredients, and continue to work toward improving data tracking capabilities for those ingredients.2020 Tomato Goals: Where We Stand

GROWNFor the Yeung family, farming roots—
and connections to Campbell Soup Company—run deep. Joe Yeung emigrated from China in 1948 and began farming. Over time, Joe’s son Richard began farming with his dad, and in 2000 they began growing tomatoes for Campbell. As he transitioned into retirement, Joe assumed that Richard’s own son would one day continue  
the tradition.
Richard did have a son, but he also had 
two daughters, Melissa and Becky. As luck would have it, Melissa worked in the agriculture department of Campbell Soup Company, and Becky worked for a company growing tomato seedlings used by Campbell tomato farmers. Both women had insights into innovations in agriculture, and five years ago, they decided to leave their jobs to farm full-time. Now, they manage the Campbell tomato contract with Joe Yeung Farms. 
The sisters rely on the knowledge of 
their father and grandfather, but have also made significant changes on the farm. For example, they initiated drip irrigation to reduce water use and purchased advanced tillage equipment to reduce the number of tractor trips through the field (and associated fuel use and carbon emissions). Taking the best of both past knowledge and present technology, the women are ensuring that their family farm is sustained for the next generation. And that next generation might just turn out to be their own daughters.Growing Tomatoes Is a Family Affair
Reviving the Soup That Started It All 
To celebrate our Real Food heritage, a team of Campbell employees brought a 100-year-old tomato soup recipe back to life. Following instructions handwritten by John Dorrance, who invented condensed soup and is responsible for making soup our middle name, we sourced local New Jersey beefsteak tomatoes and cooked up a batch in our pilot plant. The result was delicious. The limited edition jars have been sold at Cracker Barrel stores in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and continue to sell in limited quantities in local stores throughout the same region. 
With Goldfish® crackers, Milano® cookies 
and many other baked goods in our portfolio, Campbell has identified wheat as a priority ingredient to source more sustainably. We have partnered with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and Land O’Lakes’ SUSTAIN program to do our part to make fertilizer efficiency and soil health the norm in U.S. grain production, not only because of the environmental benefits, but also to help improve farmers’ bottom lines. 
SUSTAIN provides practical tools, 
products and practices that are available to farmers through Land O’Lakes’ network of agricultural retailers. Agricultural retailers serve as trusted advisors to farmers, and SUSTAIN trains them on ways to improve air, water and soil quality, while increasing yields, improving soil health and building resilience to unpredictable climate conditions. Using the power of this network, SUSTAIN hopes to eventually reach thousands of U.S. farmers working millions of acres of crops, tipping the balance in favor of more sustainable growing practices nationwide. Campbell is committed to optimizing fertilizer use on 70,000 acres of wheat and is deploying SUSTAIN in our Pepperidge Farm sourcing regions to help achieve this goal.

21 2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 21How We Manage Metrics That Matter
Transparency builds trust. That’s why we’re working to set 
the standard for transparency, with the goal of becoming the 
world’s most trusted food company. By improving transparency 
from farm to fork, we can ensure that ethical and sustainable 
practices are used across our entire supply chain. Knowing how 
our ingredients are produced and where they come from has become more important than ever as we expand our product portfolio to meet the needs of our diverse consumer base. This includes adding unique ingredients from new places, like cinnamon from Asia and quinoa from South America. As our supply chain grows more complex, it is important for us to build mechanisms for transparency to understand and minimize risks related to human rights, animal welfare, climate change and unsustainable resource consumption. To help build this transparency, Campbell’s Procurement team has revamped its Strategic Relationship Management (SRM) program. This program will focus on Campbell’s key suppliers, and social and environmental responsibility are included as elements of the program. We will engage with these suppliers through top-to-top meetings, in-person workshops and surveys, and suppliers will be rated on their performance against several key elements, one of which is sustainability.
To live into our Real Food Philosophy and our commitment 
to build trust through transparency, we created the role of Director of Responsible Sourcing in 2016. This individual reports to Campbell’s Chief Procurement Officer and is part of the Procurement Leadership Team and the extended Supply Chain Leadership Team. Along with a Responsible Sourcing Lead, our new Responsible Sourcing team is focused on building a holistic strategy for managing social issues such as human rights and animal welfare along the supply chain. 
In FY2017, we identified four strategic focus areas that will align 
with our Real Food Philosophy and help pave the way for us to become a leader in ethical and sustainable sourcing. In addition, we set forth a new set of goals and will begin reporting progress in the next fiscal year.CAMPBELL ’S GLOBAL CERTIFIED

 FOCUS AREA:  Responsibly source 
ingredients, packaging and services 
for our products and operations 
We strive to procure ingredients, 
packaging and services from suppliers who share our commitment to environmental stewardship, ethical business practices and diversity. Our Responsible Sourcing Supplier Code, published in May 2017, is applicable to all suppliers globally. The Code is the foundation of our Responsible Sourcing Program, which is currently being rolled out to our suppliers. The Program incorporates a holistic approach of education and compliance, such as training for Campbell’s buyers globally, supplier training and supplier audits. 
Responsible sourcing extends to the 
animal products used in our food, including eggs, chicken, pork and beef. This year, we rolled out new Animal Welfare Guidelines, which include a new commitment to broiler chicken welfare. We are making progress on our pledges regarding cage-free eggs and gestation crates for hogs. Campbell is also working to address ingredients whose sourcing may have unintended social or environmental impacts, such as deforestation resulting from palm oil cultivation.

23 2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 23 FOCUS AREA: Develop a diverse  
supply base that reflects the 
demographics of our consumers
Supplier diversity adds value to our 
long-term growth, strengthens our competitive advantage and can increase market share and shareholder return. Our supplier diversity program is focused on strengthening our U.S. supply base by offering diverse suppliers equal access to potential business opportunities.
 GOAL: By 2020: Measurably 
advance Campbell’s Supplier Diversity ProgramOur Strategic Focus Areas and Goals, cont.
 FOCUS AREA: Advance respect 
for human rights in our operations and across our supply chain
Our commitment to health and well-
being extends to protecting the human rights of the people along our supply chain, but it starts with our own employees. In our own operations, we hold ourselves accountable to a set of Human Rights Principles to ensure we are treating our own employees with respect and are compliant with industry standards. As part of our engagement with the Consumer Goods Forum’s Social Sustainability Committee, we updated Campbell’s Human Rights Principles in 2017 to include and codify our long-standing policy for ensuring no forced labor exists in our own operations. These Principles are the foundation of a new internal Social Accountability Program which is under development and will include employee training, proactive internal facility audits, and alignment between our internal Code of Conduct and Responsible Sourcing Supplier Code.
 GOAL: By 2020: Proactively assess 
100% of Campbell-owned facilities for compliance with Human Rights Principles FOCUS AREA: Improve capabilities 
for farm to fork traceability
We know that today’s consumers want 
to know exactly what’s in the food they are feeding their families, down to where the ingredients in those foods come from. We are committed to traceability of the priority raw materials that go into our products, and as technologies like blockchain become more widespread, we are exploring ways to build full traceability in our supply chain from farm to fork. 
 GOAL: By 2025: 100% of priority 
raw materials are traceable to country of origin
Diverse Suppliers  for a Diverse Consumer Base 
Through support of minority- and women-owned businesses, Campbell has increased our social impact on local communities by offering employment opportunities, modeling behavior for younger generations and encouraging purchases from other diverse businesses. We’ve also witnessed competitive cost and quality improvements, responsiveness and agility to adapt to changing business needs, dedicated and enhanced customer service, and fresh perspectives that promote innovation. In FY2017, we updated our Supplier Diversity Commitment and joined Walmart and other consumer goods companies in collectively reporting our annual spend with women-owned businesses.

Where Does 
Arnott’s Chocolate Come From? 
Cocoa liquor is what gives Arnott’s biscuits their distinctive taste. Our cocoa liquor comes from beans grown in Southeast Asia and Ghana, and our biscuits contain blends of chocolate from both regions. Because ethical production issues, such as forced labor and child labor, exist for cocoa grown in West Africa, all of our chocolate from that region is certified Fair Trade. 
Palm oil is the most widely consumed 
vegetable oil around the world and is used as an ingredient in some of Campbell’s snacking products, such as cookies and crackers. It requires less land to grow than soya, rapeseed and sunflower, the other three major oil-producing crops, and can also support jobs in emerging economies. However, improper sourcing of palm oil can contribute to deforestation, which can increase global GHG emissions, harm wildlife and impact vulnerable communities. For these reasons, Campbell is working to ensure responsible sourcing and traceability  of palm oil used in our products.
In 2016, Campbell achieved its goal of 
using 100 percent Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) in our global operations, and we have committed to providing full plantation-level traceability by  
2020. To date, we have achieved  
98 percent traceability to the mill and 58 percent traceability to the plantation. We updated our Sustainable Palm Oil Sourcing Guidelines in 2017 to reflect this progress. In our Arnott’s and Kelsen businesses, we have taken it a step further and use 100 percent segregated palm oil, ensuring that all palm oil originates from CSPO plantations and is fully traceable.
Sustainably sourced palm oil has been 
a priority at Arnott’s for years, due in part to the Australian market’s proximity to Indonesia and Malaysia, the source of roughly 85 percent of global palm oil. Engagement with consumers and NGOs near Arnott’s Australian headquarters has helped the brand emerge as a leader on this issue and earn a perfect score on the World Wildlife Fund’s 2016 Palm Oil Buyers Scorecard. A More Transparent Palm Oil Supply Chain

2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT25
PRODUCEDSOURCEDThe humane treatment of animals 
is an important part of our vision for a responsible supply chain. NGOs, consumers and other outside experts have shared concerns about the welfare of animals whose meat and eggs are present in our food, as well as the negative environmental, health and social consequences of certain practices. We’re listening and moving  to address concerns.
Changes such as these are complicated 
and require time, investment and partnership to succeed. They must also align with our commitment to ensuring access to good, affordable food for our consumers. We will continue to work with NGOs, growers, suppliers, peers and other industry stakeholders to identify cost-effective solutions for our industry. 
Cage-Free Eggs 
We have committed to sourcing exclusively cage-free eggs globally by 2025. As of September 2017, 12 percent of Campbell’s egg supply was cage-free. Kelsen and Arnott’s are leading the way in this effort, as both have already transitioned to cage-free eggs. 
Broiler Chickens
In 2017, Campbell implemented a Whole Bird Model for sourcing our chicken meat in the U.S. and Canada. In addition to the economic benefits, this model gives us visibility into the entire life cycle of the chicken, from egg incubation and hatching to growth and processing. This will be instrumental in ensuring that all chicken meat in our North American product portfolio is raised with No Antibiotics Ever (NAE) by FY2018.In addition, we committed to working with our suppliers to improve the treatment of broiler chickens while thoughtfully addressing the impact of these standards on the farmers from whom we source. We aim to move our U.S. chicken meat supply to a higher standard of animal welfare by 2024  that includes: 
• Transitioning to breeds of birds approved by Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) or the Global Animal Partnership (GAP), which are scientifically recognized as having higher welfare outcomes
• Providing more space for chickens by reducing stocking density to a maximum of six pounds per square foot
• Offering improved environments including litter, lighting and enrichment that meet GAP’s new standards
• Processing chickens in a manner that avoids pre-stun handling and instead uses multistep, controlled atmospheric stunning
• Using third-party auditing to ensure compliance
PorkIn 2012, we made a commitment to eliminate gestation crates from our pork supply chain. With our suppliers’ engagement, we intend to reach that goal no later than 2022. We have made progress on this commitment, due to both favoring suppliers that raise hogs in a gestation crate-free environment and continuing to work with suppliers who have transitioned from crates to group housing. We also favor suppliers that can provide audit and tracking reports for sourcing of crate-free pork. As of September 2017, 34 percent of Campbell’s pork supply is crate-free.

PRODUCEDSOURCEDCampbell has made a $40 million 
investment in new packaging capabil-ities to help Arnott’s address environ-mental, consumer and economic needs. Much of this investment is centered at Arnott’s Huntingwood bakery in Western Sydney, where a new Multi-Pack Centre equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and technology was opened to support product and packaging innovations. Biscuits produced in the facility are now packed into recyclable corrugated boxes, rather than the nonrecyclable plastic bags that once held multiple single-serving packs. The boxes are also more efficient to ship, which means fewer delivery trucks on the road. Once they arrive at supermarkets, products from the Multi-Pack Centre should also please consumers. The new corrugated packaging protects biscuits from breaking, is easier to navigate on store shelves and fits more neatly in a pantry. The Huntingwood facility employs more than 500 people, and is the latest recipient of Arnott’s investments in Australian manufacturing, which total more than a quarter of a billion dollars over the past five years. Through this project, Arnott’s managed to score a win for the environment, its consumers and its community.

PRODUCEDSOURCEDA Packaging Evolution at Plum Organics  
and Pepperidge Farm
Responsible sourcing extends beyond the ingredients in our food. It also includes 
a focus on the packaging in which we deliver our products. Plum Organics, a Public Benefit Corporation and certified B Corp, along with Pepperidge Farm are making progress on packaging sustainability in ways both big and small.
1. Improved retail cartons. In FY2017, 
Plum Organics transitioned 100 percent of its pouch portfolio to a six-pouch, 100-percent recyclable corrugated carton and eliminated the need for an additional corrugated shipping box. This reduced our total corrugated packaging by weight by 40 percent. We eliminated this extra layer of packaging by upgrading the cartons to “ship to sell” status, adding shelf-ready graphics and perforation to each box. 
2. New products.  In 2017, Plum Organics 
launched Baby Bowls designed for 
spoon-feeding. They join baby formula tubs and containers of Super Puffs®  
snacks in the Plum Organics® lineup of fully recyclable product packages. 
3. Strong partnerships.  Plum Organics 
partners with industry leaders, such as Materials Recovery for the Future and One Step Closer to an Organic and Sustainable Community (OSC
2), 
to actively seek out new, more sustainable materials and end-of-life solutions for packaging waste.   Plum Organics also remains a member of How2Recycle, a labeling system that makes it easier for consumers to recycle.
4. Consumer engagement.  Plum 
Organics pouch caps, which are made of #5 plastic, are too small to go through the standard recycling system. Plum Organics and other participants in the Preserve “Gimme 5” program encourage consumers to save up these plastics and dispose of them in Preserve’s designated bins inside Whole Foods Markets and other stores. Once collected, they are transformed into products like toothbrushes and razors. 
5. Updated materials.  Pepperidge 
Farm transitioned from polyethylene-coated paperboard to an aqueous coating called Enshield for its layer cake cartons. The cartons require 1.3 million pounds of paperboard annually, and now that amount is  fully recyclable, without increasing cost for the company.

How We Manage Metrics That Matter
Real food is prepared with care. It should be crafted using sustainable 
practices that safeguard the natural resources we all share. That means 
producing our food with minimal impact on the environment, ensuring the 
safety and quality of every product we sell, and developing employees 
with the knowledge and tools they need to do their best work. 
A rising global population and accelerated resource use make a 
sustainable business model more important than ever. We have set aggressive targets to reduce our footprint, and our environmental management system helps us to better manage compliance, reduce costs and increase efficiencies. The risk of operating unsustainably is detrimental to long-term success and impacts profitability and reputation.
In 2017, we reaffirmed our commitment to climate action by signing 
the “We Are Still In” declaration. Our commitment to addressing the risks of climate change and reducing our environmental impact is unwavering. We continue to promote stewardship of natural resources in our operations by investing in efficient and low-carbon technologies and practices. Starting with our own operations, we are using our role as a leading food company to help tackle the global challenge of waste, especially food waste. We also continue to invest in energy- and water-saving opportunities. 
The global engineering team, in conjunction with the local facility 
engineers and Campbell’s sustainability team, transform these resource-reduction opportunities into actionable projects that bring about real change. Since global data tracking began in FY2008, we have reduced GHG emissions intensity by 39 percent, energy intensity by 25 percent and water intensity by 36 percent. In FY2016, reflecting significant changes in our operations due to acquisitions and divestitures, we set new environmental targets for our operations. These targets use FY2017 as the base year and are more aggressive in that they require absolute reductions.
Food safety and quality are implicit requirements for any major food 
company. We dedicate all resources at our disposal to ensure that consumers are protected from foodborne illnesses, allergens or other health and safety concerns, and are transparent about what ingredients are present in our food. Campbell has a long history of regulatory compliance and is in compliance with all applicable regulations, including the provisions of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).

PRODUCEDWe continue to expand our contribution 
to the clean energy economy through renewable energy investments. In 2017, a 4.4 MW solar array was installed at Campbell’s world headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, making it the largest solar array in the city. Through carport, rooftop and ground-mount solar solutions, we are generating the equivalent of 20 percent of our world headquarters’ electricity demand and making use of an otherwise unusable brownfield. The project also features electric vehicle (EV) charging stations for Campbell employees, encouraging the use of EVs. 
This project joins four other existing 
renewable energy projects at Campbell facilities, a 9.8 MW solar array in Napoleon, Ohio; a 1 MW solar array in Bloomfield, Connecticut; and 1.2 MW and 1.4 MW fuel cells in Bloomfield, Connecticut. In total, Campbell contributes 27,670 MWh of renewable energy to the grid annually.
Solar Energy Is Heating Up in Camden
In alignment with the Montreal Protocol, Campbell has made a commitment to reduce the use of hydrochlorofluoro-carbon (HCFC) refrigerants, specifically R22, at our facilities. HCFCs, such as R22, are known to deplete the ozone layer. At our Pepperidge Farm facil-ities in Downingtown, Pennsylvania; Lakeland, Florida; Richmond, Utah; and Willard, Ohio, we phased out our R22 refrigerants by converting to low-charge ammonia and CO
2, which are natural refrigerants. The use of natural  refrigerants significantly improves energy efficiency, lowers energy costs and reduces GHG emissions, which contribute to climate change.
Campbell has also commissioned a 
new CO
2 refrigeration system at its 
corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. The CO
2 system will 
support a new centralized storage cooler and freezer facility in the corporate R&D pilot plant. In addition, we installed a CO
2 system for a new 
frozen bread line in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, which was commissioned in January 2018.
By transitioning to best-in-class 
refrigeration technology, Campbell is also aligned with the Consumer Goods Forum’s commitment to phase out hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants.Making Our Refrigeration Systems More Efficient

Campbell’s Bolthouse Farms business has made significant strides in tackling water efficiency at our carrot packing and juicing facility, thanks to two recent equipment updates. After implementing cleaning and refurbishment pilot projects, our cooling towers now require 27 percent less incoming water and 80 percent less blowdown water. This will save the facility more than 25 million gallons of water per year. By retrofitting our reverse osmosis technology and improving monitoring, we will be able to increase the reverse osmosis recovery rate from 72 percent to 90 percent, with an expected savings of over 40 million gallons of water per year. Finally, new ultra-low pressure membranes will last 20 percent longer than other membranes and reduce energy use and costs, delivering both a financial and environmental win for the facility.

PRODUCEDThe statistics on food waste are hard 
to believe—but impossible to ignore. Across the world, roughly one-third of all food produced intended for human consumption is lost or wasted. At the same time, one in nine people remains undernourished. This inefficiency amounts to economic losses of close to $1 trillion per year. Campbell is committed to doing our part to address this challenge and has set a goal to  cut our food waste in half by 2030. 
Engaging With Our Peers
This effort starts at the top. Campbell’s CEO, Denise Morrison, is a Champion in Champions 12.3, a group of executives from government, business and civil society committed to accelerating prog-ress on UN Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 to cut food waste in half worldwide by 2030. Denise’s leader-ship has expanded Campbell’s visi-bility regarding food waste globally. Internally, it has increased our focus on building transparency into sources of food waste and strategies for reduction. Campbell participated in the development of the Food Loss and Waste Accounting and Reporting Standard with the World Resources Institute. This Standard, which we implemented in FY2017, provides guidance to more precisely measure the types of food waste generated in an organization’s operations and the destinations of those waste streams. This Standard has helped Campbell establish a baseline by which to measure and report on efforts to achieve our food waste reduction goal. Campbell is also a member of The Consumer Goods Forum Food Waste working group and was among the first companies to be a U.S. Food  
Loss and Waste 2030 Champion. 
Consistent with our commitment 
to transparency in all facets of our business, Campbell supports a product labeling framework that clearly communicates food quality and food safety. This stance aligns with the Consumer Goods Forum’s Call to Action on food date labeling. We believe that simplifying and harmonizing labels and establishing federal standards for “best if used by” and “use by” language will reduce consumer confusion and limit waste. 
A Closer Look at Our Operations 
We’re making progress against our 2030 goal to reduce food waste by  50 percent. For example, we’ve reconfigured production equipment to decrease ingredient waste during processing. Lost ingredients are diverted to feed animals. 
In Canada, we recently tackled food 
loss and waste at our Toronto facility, partnering with Provision Coalition, Canada’s food and beverage manu-facturing sustainability organization. We piloted Provision Coalition’s online Food Waste Reduction Toolkit and engaged Enviro-Stewards to conduct a food waste prevention assessment. Enviro-Stewards evaluated the entire operation, from raw vegetable receiving to final product packaging and canning, and identified measures that could increase the amount of food produced by the facility by 938 tonnes per year.

PRODUCEDCarrot processing at Bolthouse Farms is designed to make 
use of the entire carrot from tip to greens. Take a look: Making the Most of Every Vegetable 
Carrot tops are left behind in our fields to improve soil health.
Long narrow carrots bred for their sweet taste and small core are cut and peeled into baby carrots or chopped into time-saving products like Chips and Matchstix. 
Thicker whole carrots are bagged unpeeled for fresh produce sales.
Other whole carrots and broken pieces are juiced into fresh beverages, like our Mango Ginger + Carrot juice. 
Unripe tomatoes, stems and other plant material are returned to the ground at harvest to improve soil health. 
At our facilities, stems and damaged fruit are sorted and sent to nearby cattle farms for animal feed or to compost. 
Tomato peels and seeds become ingredients for animal feed and pet food. 
Fruit that doesn’t match the size needed to make diced tomatoes is rerouted to another production line to make tomato paste. 
In Campbell’s tomato operations, everything has a 
purpose, and nothing is wasted—practices that we think would make our company’s farming founders proud.

PRODUCED
Preparing safe, high-quality food 
has always been one of Campbell’s 
fundamental strengths. We assess food safety risk in our operations in compliance with the current requirements of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) of 2011, and are always working to continually improve ahead of emerging requirements. FSMA aims to help food 
manufacturers shift their focus from 
resolving issues to preventing them from happening in the first place and is the most significant legislation passed on food safety in the last 30 years. 
As we begin to offer more packaged 
fresh products and new ingredients, Campbell’s portfolio is becoming more complex, making this a perfect time to enhance our quality controls. We have incorporated additional controls and prevention steps to mitigate food safety risks within our processes. In addition, all of our manufacturing facilities worldwide are audited and certified to the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) standard. 
The rollout of FSMA has also been an 
opportunity for closer collaboration with our suppliers and across our industry. Members of Campbell’s food safety and quality team have participated in industry events to share expertise and set benchmarks. Over 100 of our employees have received FSMA-related training and certification. In addition, we’re working with our suppliers, particularly those with smaller operations, to help them provide the documentation that the law now requires. Thanks to FSMA, food is becoming safer worldwide, and Campbell is proud to help raise the bar. In FY2017, operations in our Asia-Pacific region reduced energy use by  4 percent and water use by 11 percent across the region. Operations in  
Denmark were able to expand production while managing energy usage.  Here are some of the projects that are contributing to our success.
Australia  
HuntingwoodWe replaced all fluorescent office lighting with LEDs and added motion sensors, reducing our electricity usage for office lighting by 40 percent. 
Shepparton 
After implementing the second phase of a new water sterilization process, we’re saving more than 80,000 liters of water per year. In addition, using only behavior-based initiatives, we’ve reduced waste to landfill by 17 percent.
Virginia
New semi-automated ovens will offer more fine-tuned controls and optimized start-up times, giving us better control over natural gas usage. Denmark
Nørre SnedeWe installed a new ventilation system, which will improve air quality in the plant and save over 440,000 kWh per year. In addition, by optimizing our compressed air supply lines, we were able to meet increased production demands while saving more than 240,000 kWh per year.
Ribe
When installing our new Pepperidge Farm production line, we needed to increase our cooling capacity and were able to optimize our energy consumption while meeting the cooling capacity demand. This reduced the plant’s energy use by over 470,000 kWh per year.

The strength of our products depends on the strength of our 
workforce. We believe that creating a high-performance culture 
rooted in integrity, accountable for results and committed to 
bringing our Purpose to life is essential to the sustainability of 
our company. This requires the interplay of many elements, 
including talent management, business ethics, workplace 
safety and wellness, employee engagement and diversity 
and inclusion. Attracting, developing, engaging and retaining 
a diverse and high-performing workforce reflective of our 
consumer base is crucial to achieving our business objectives. 
To this end, Campbell’s CEO, Denise Morrison, has joined the 
CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion™ and has committed to 
advancing diversity and inclusion throughout the organization through the hiring of a Chief Diversity Officer, the sharing of best 
and unsuccessful practices, the expansion of unconscious bias 
education and the fostering of a safe work environment for all 
employees to have challenging conversations.
In February 2017, Campbell launched a new communication 
and information-sharing platform to global salaried employees, 
Workplace by Facebook, which has transformed how employees 
connect and engage. The platform has facilitated cross-functional 
visibility, collaboration and recognition. In just nine months, we 
saw a significant increase in engagement metrics compared to our 
previous internal communications platform, including an increase 
of 121 percent in readership, a 201 percent increase in reactions 
and a 234 percent increase in commenting. It has also opened 
up new opportunities for employee engagement in sustainability 
through storytelling and competitions, which have encouraged 
positive behaviors like recycling and using reusable mugs.

Since 2014, we’ve been on a 
journey to become a purpose-driven organization. We began by defining our Purpose, Real food that matters for life’s moments, which helped us capture who we are, what we believe, and the company we want to be. We’ve made great progress on our journey, including our work to define what real food means to us through our Real Food Philosophy. But to truly activate the philosophy and become a purpose-driven organization with innovation at the helm, we needed to reinvent our culture, and that started with answering a simple question–What do we value?
In 2016, the Campbell Leadership 
Team set out to answer that question. Each word was meticulously and purposefully chosen with the goal of redefining Campbell’s Values to create the behaviors and culture we need to live into our Purpose. We believe in these Values and the accompanying behaviors they put forth. Our Values are a representation of what our company and our people have always stood for, while inspiring us to embrace change to compete effectively in a dynamic marketplace.
How We’re Living Our Values
More than a year after introducing these Values, we’re seeing them come to life in a variety of ways across Campbell: 
• On our social network. Campbell employees interact on Workplace, an internal social media platform powered by Facebook. Our people have gotten creative and made the site their own, using the hashtag function to tag corporate Values in their posts. • In our talent development efforts. Our Values are being embedded into performance management internally and behavioral interviewing externally, allowing us to attract and retain individuals who share Campbell’s ideals. 
• In our training. We introduced new Campbell University training through which employees can learn how to apply the Values to their own work. Values 360 helps employees assess how well their own behaviors align with company standards. 
• From our leaders. Our C100, or the top 100 leaders within Campbell, are key to transforming our culture to reflect our Values. Leaders recorded a series of videos discussing what Campbell’s Values mean to them. Dare

Each year, Campbell recognizes teams 
across the organization who are living our Purpose, Real food that matters for life’s moments. These employees exemplify our core Values and are recognized for their contributions to our success. Read the stories of a few Living Our Purpose award winners for FY2017. 
Do Right and Be Real
Our Maxton, North Carolina, Community Team has made significant improve-ments to its already strong community engagement efforts. The team tripled its giving to the United Way; has achieved $1.1 million in giving over 14 years of hosting the Campbell’s Kids for a Cure Golf Tournament benefiting the American Cancer Society’s Relay for Life; and expanded sustainability programming.
Seek the Power of Different
Our Black Resource Group leverages the power of different in workforce diversity. They are committed to driving development, affinity and retention for their members. In FY2017, they engaged leaders and influencers to make progress toward inclusion across a range of corporate and business issues.
Dare to Disrupt
Campbell is committed to expanding our e-commerce offerings, and the Pepperidge Farm® Goldfish® Cracker team is making important strides. The team made Goldfish the #1 cracker on Amazon and figured out how to sell Fresh Bakery on Amazon Prime Pantry, becoming the first manufacturer to sell fresh products on Amazon’s highest-volume grocery platform.
Own It Like a Founder
Our North American Food Service team redesigned more than 120 products to create the cleanest-label products in Campbell’s portfolio. They made sure that each ingredient earned its place in every recipe, just as our founders did. For their efforts, they were recognized with the Dr. John T. Dorrance Award, the most coveted of the Living Our Purpose awards.
Recognizing Those Who Live Our Purpose
Campbell’s Purpose–Real food that matters for life’s moments–serves as a filter for decision-making in all aspects of our business, from the ingredients in our products to the ways we engage with consumers. Our choices about employee benefits are no exception. 
In 2016, we began offering 10 weeks of 
fully paid leave to primary caregivers and two weeks of fully paid leave to non-primary caregivers in the U.S. following the birth or adoption of a child. We’re proud of this decision, which puts Campbell in a leading position in the U.S. food industry with respect to parental leave. Campbell parents are also looking foward to our new Family Center, located on the campus of our world headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. The center will provide care for children from infancy through kindergarten and focus on health and well-being, with nutritious food choices and optional activities like karate  
and dance.  We’re continuing to engage with our employees on other benefits that matter to them. Beginning in 2017, Campbell began offering a majority of Medicare-eligible retirees access to health care coverage through a private exchange. This change gives our post-65 retirees greater choice and advocacy support to meet their individual needs. In line with our companywide commitment to well-being and health, we are in the process of revamping our employee well-being offerings and have formed a work group that will determine what benefits are most needed at each of our facilities. Our Purpose will continue to guide us as we explore additional benefits for Campbell employees and their families.

The makeup of Campbell’s workforce 
is changing, and with it, the resources our employees need to find meaning in their work and chart their career paths. We began to respond to this changing dynamic in 2016, when we conducted our most recent Drive Survey of salaried and hourly employees globally. 
The survey measured “performance 
confidence,” which research shows is a strong predictor of an organization’s success. Performance confidence is defined as the extent to which employees believe that Campbell has an outstanding competitive future, based on innovative, high-quality products and services that are highly regarded by the marketplace. We were pleased to see strong scores against this measure. The survey also revealed high levels of employee engagement. Employees reported pride in Campbell’s history and iconic brands and optimism about our company’s future. 
At the same time, our employees 
were telling us they wanted more meaningful and personal career conversations, more transparent access to opportunities and a more personal connection to their work. The Drive Survey identified gaps in resources for career development and in managers’ ability to help employees clarify and pursue their career goals. That’s why over the past year, Campbell has been hard at work transforming the way that we help employees think about growth and development. 
Our Career Commitment 
The result is Our Career Commitment, a new talent development strategy rooted in transparency and intentionally designed to reflect our new way of looking at talent practices. The Commitment encourages employees  
to practice three habits: get to know the real you, explore real options and take real action. 
Our Career Commitment formally 
launched in 2017 with a career day at our global headquarters and subsequent events at facilities worldwide. An internal website, launched at the same time, gives employees resources to assist them in reflecting on their personal values and goals, learning about colleagues’ career paths and tuition assistance for continuing education, and applying for open roles within Campbell. An important part of this new framework is Campbell Gigs, a pilot program initially undertaken by our HR and Finance organizations. Gigs are voluntary side projects that employees can use to learn and support their career journeys with on-the-job skills. For example, an HR professional interested in communications could voluntarily work on a communication plan for the rollout of a new process, or an employee who wants to gain financial experience could participate  in an audit process. 
Employees can explore, apply for 
and provide feedback on their Gig experiences using our Workday platform. We are expanding Gigs to other Campbell functions and will roll out additional career development tools, such as a talent marketplace and coaching resources, to the myCareer platform over the coming year. As we do so, we will assess our progress using Drive Surveys and stay/exit interviews to refine our offerings and continue to meet the needs of our evolving talent base. 
Using Transparency to Transform Careers 
We believe great 
careers are: 
SELF-DRIVEN
Discover your personal purpose and let it shape your path. We’ll help guide you. 
MULTIFACETED
Seek new opportunities that  offer the greatest learning.  Have courage to experiment  and explore.

Campbell’s relentless focus on 
employee safety has continually produced results that exceed industry benchmarks. In FY2017, we updated the tactics outlined in our Environmental Health & Safety strategy in the areas of leadership, employee engagement and safety systems. Underlying all new tactics is a deliberate focus on communication, transparency and reporting of results. For example, new Daily Direction Setting meetings provide routine, consistent communication on common safety hazards. Site Improvement Plans help individual plants identify unique ways to address concerns. And new training on ergonomics and slips, trips and falls is getting more employees engaged and thinking proactively about reducing risk. These tactics are paying off: Campbell saw a 13 percent reduction in its Lost Time Incident Rate (0.23 to 0.20) between FY2016 and FY2017 and a 30 percent reduction in its Total Recordable Incident Rate (1.96 to 1.37). Though these are best-in-class achievements, we will continue to  strive for zero injuries by focusing on the small, day-to-day actions that  make everyone safer. 
Safety for Everyone, Every Day
We’re especially proud of these Campbell teams:
INDONESIA
Our Indonesia team achieved 10 million hours without a Lost Time Incident (LTI), making them Campbell’s leading LTI-free site globally. The team celebrated this milestone with a meal served by the Indonesian leadership team.
RICHMOND, UTAH
Our Richmond plant has achieved a Total Recordable Incident Rate of 1.0 for seven years in a row, which is significantly below our sector’s industry standard, and has gone more than 440 days without a recordable incident. This success is thanks, in large part, to the “Red Belt” safety team’s relentless efforts to drive safety engagement and shift culture to a zero-accident mindset. The Plant Management team also played a critical role in achieving 100 percent participation in the facility’s 90-day safety blitz.
MAXTON, NORTH CAROLINA
The North Carolina Department of Labor honored our Maxton team with the Gold Award for safety for the 20th year in a  
row. To qualify for the annual safety award, a firm must have  
no fatalities during the calendar year at the site for which  
the award was given and maintain an incident rate at least  
50 percent below average for its industry group.

How can a company make more room 
for women in top leadership positions? One way is to ensure that women are empowered and included at every step in the career pipeline. This was the thinking behind Be Real Circles, an opportunity for leading Campbell women to “pay it forward” to other women on their way up. 
The idea originated with a group of 
the company’s top female leaders who were being mentored by Campbell CEO Denise Morrison. In 2017, these women decided to share what they’d learned with a wider audience. The Be Real Circles were launched as a pilot program by Women of Campbell (WOC) during Women’s History Month in March. Each Circle is facilitated by one of the female leaders, who mentors a group of no more than eight Campbell women. Circle leaders use a toolkit and discussion Helping Campbell  Women Lift Each Other Up

We rely heavily on them as pathways to leverage talent and increase cultural curiosity, sensitivity and connection. Our groups currently include: 
• Asian Network of Campbell (ANC): Focuses on Asian employee and professional development
• Black Resource Group (BRG): Works to attract, retain and empower top black talent
• Bridge Network: Fosters trust and collaboration across generations
• Campbell Administrative Professionals (CAPs): Enhances organizations’ vitality and promotes excellence among administrative employees

Out and Proud
Bethmara Kessler SVP , Integrated Global Services 
My career journey has led me to many crossroads—am 
I in the closet, or am I out? For most of my career I was in—a very difficult place to be. I had to compartmentalize myself into two separate people; Work Me and Real Me. Integrity prevented me from lying about who I was, so I built a wall of privacy around my life outside of work. Making authentic connections with people was never truly possible. 
This story is not unique. It applies to all of us. It’s familiar 
to kids who grew up feeling different, who played on the perimeter of the playground but never got picked for a team. It’s familiar to the mom or dad who leaves work at 5 p.m. to pick up a child from daycare and detects a side-eye glance from colleagues. It’s familiar to anyone trying to be someone they are not.
As I considered the opportunity to join Campbell 
three years ago, being fully out was non-negotiable. Now, three years later, being out has never been an issue—Campbell not only encourages, but embraces the real me. I’m proud to be part of an organization that has scored 100 percent on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index not once, but eight times. I am proud that this company embraces employee diversity with affinity networks, which I have dedicated my time to as the executive sponsor of Our Pride Employee Network (OPEN). And I’m proud that our marketing, such as our Made for Real, Real Life campaign features modern American families, including gay and lesbian couples.
Our differences make 
us awesome. That’s why I tell Campbell employees to show their pride and be themselves. There’s no one else you can be.

How We Manage Metrics That Matter How We Manage Metrics That Matter1
Campbell’s Real Food Philosophy has revolutionized the way 
we think, talk and act about our food. We’re staying abreast of 
changes in food and nutrition to better understand how we can 
provide consumers with the healthy foods they desire and thus 
identify opportunities for growth. If Campbell doesn’t evolve with 
these changes, we risk being left behind. 
One important trend we’re addressing is consumer demand 
for greater transparency. Campbell is committed to setting the standard for transparency in the food industry, sharing more information about what goes into our food and listening more closely to consumers about what matters to them. These conversations have led us to add positive ingredients, like vegetables and whole grains, and minimize negative nutrients, like sodium and sugar; expand our organic offerings; and remove substances of concern, like artificial colors and flavors, antibiotics in chicken meat and BPA linings in steel cans. 
This mindset has inspired brand-new products that deliver whole 
grains, vegetables, lean protein and plant-based options for consumers. These new products have required us to identify new suppliers, production methods and packaging alternatives, and, as we make progress, we’re sharing what we learn at every step. On the public policy front, we’re a leading advocate for guidelines that tell consumers more about what’s in their food, including mandatory labeling of GMOs. We believe that people have a right to know what they’re eating and feeding their families, and we will continue to push for greater transparency throughout our supply chain and across our industry. 
In response to global increases in chronic diseases and greater 
understanding of the links between food and health, we are also observing heightened consumer interest in fresh and healthy foods. Consumers are seeking out more nutritious, personalized food that suits their lifestyles and values. We’re seeing the emergence of an age in which shoppers purchase food online and use technology to track and monitor their personal health. As this new food future evolves, Campbell is committed to being the leading health and well-being food company. SALES FROM PRODUCTS

What We’re Taking Out of Our Food
We are working hard to deliver real food with recognizable ingredients. We make decisions about what ingredients to 
use in our recipes based on the best health and nutrition science, and we’re learning more every day. We also improve with feedback from our consumers, who know best what’s right for them and their families.

BPA linings in soup cansTransitioned to 100% of 
steel can linings in U.S.

presence of bisphenol A (BPA) in steel cans. We

is antibiotic freeWe will no longer allow antibiotics to be added to the 
feed, water or any commercial vaccines used by our

What happens when you put 
transparency, health and well-being first when crafting a new product? Look no further than Well Yes!, a new line of soups launched in early 2017. 
The idea began with a group of 
Campbell employees who started thinking about their own cooking—and realized there was something missing from the soup aisle at supermarkets. These employees wanted a soup that contained real, nutritious ingredients they could feel good about serving their families. They also wanted something quick and easy to prepare: food that fit into their busy lives. 
They suspected others felt the same 
way. Our chefs, product developers and nutritionists began talking to consumers and discovered a similar need. People craved delicious meals with clean labels and purposeful ingredients, like kale, quinoa and lean protein. But they didn’t want to compromise on affordability. 
With these desires in mind, we looked 
back into our supply chain. We leveraged relationships with existing suppliers to source classic ingredients like tomatoes and celery, and built new relationships with small-scale suppliers for ingredients that are firsts for Campbell, such as black barley, fennel, farro and jicama.  The cross-functional team that undertook this project co-created the product with a group of consumers, which was an entirely new approach for the company. The process  forced us to think differently—not just about ingredients, but also flavor combinations and even package design. The team also managed to iterate rapidly, entering the market  six months ahead of schedule. 
The result is Well Yes!, a line of soups 
that meet consumer demands for cleaner ingredients and provide an incredibly strong nutritional profile. Each Well Yes! variety uses real food ingredients to deliver at least two positive nutrients like iron, potassium, calcium, vitamin A, protein or fiber and most also deliver a serving of vegetables. Take a closer look: 
Well Yes!®: A Better Soup From the Can Up 
Well Yes! is one of the most successful Campbell soup launches of the past 10 years, achieving $28 million in retail sales in just six months. Since the brand launched, we’ve introduced five new varieties and made our way into 6 million households—allowing more people than ever to say yes to real food. WHAT’S THERE

Real Food Shouldn’t Go to Waste SHARED
Putting Transparency on the Menu 
Since the days of our founder, who 
insisted on using only Jersey beefsteak tomatoes in our cans of soup, openness about our ingredients has been part of Campbell’s consumer promise. With the launch of our Purpose and Real Food Philosophy, we’ve rededicated ourselves to serving real food to our consumers and sharing more about what’s in our products. 
Our Real Food Philosophy combines 
the wisdom of our heritage with insights about what matters to consumers today. Transparency is the foundation of this philosophy. We believe that transparency builds trust, and we strive to be open about our ingredients, processes and decisions regarding our food. 
This isn’t just theoretical. Transparency 
touches every aspect of our business, from supplier engagement and talent development to our annual incentive program. Nowhere is this commitment clearer than in how we’re communicating with consumers. Across our products and brands, we’re exploring new ways to tell consumers more about what’s in their food. 
WhatsInMyFood.com
Consumers asked, “What’s in my food?” and we’re answering. This website dives deep into the choices behind the ingredients in Campbell’s brands, including where they come from and how they’re prepared. It also addresses less common ingredients and explains their purposes, such as to improve color or texture. Arnott’s, Campbell Canada, Pepperidge Farm and Plum Organics introduced similar transparency webpages in 2016 and 2017. 
The Sage Project 
While we’re proud to offer brand-level transparency on WhatsInMyFood.com, we wanted to go deeper and share what’s inside individual Campbell products. To determine what and how to share, we talked with consumers to better understand their expectations. We learned that about one in three consumers is actively seeking product information beyond what’s available 
The Sage Project presents product-level 
data in a user-friendly way.

on a label, including nutrition profiles, 
definitions of unfamiliar ingredients and ingredient origins. 
These insights led us to The Sage 
Project, a nutrition technology startup that is helping us present product-level data in a compelling, user-friendly way. We began with a pilot with our new Well Yes!® soups. When a user visits a product page on the Well Yes! website, they can view a product’s nutritional content, ingredient descriptions, a list of potential allergens and other important information, like whether it’s sold in recyclable packaging. Campbell will expand this information to more U.S. SKUs over the next two years, and consumers can easily access this information on brand websites. 
Pushing for Nationwide Progress
We believe that knowing what’s in your food should be a right for all consumers—not just those who purchase our products. That’s why we’re advocating for smart national policies regarding food labeling and staying on the leading edge of compliance with new requirements. The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) new Nutrition Facts panel is designed to be easier to interpret, with calories more visible and both per-serving and per-container nutrition information for certain package sizes. The new panels also calculate added sugars as a percentage of total sugars and require reporting of nutrients of public health concern, such as potassium and Vitamin D. Campbell became one of the first food companies to use these new standards, and although the FDA has delayed the date at which it will require full compliance, we’re continuing to strive to meet the original deadline of July 2018. 
Campbell also continues to participate 
in the Facts Up Front program, printing calories per serving and nutrients to limit on the front of product packages. As new issues rise to the forefront of consumers’ minds, Campbell will find new ways to deliver our Purpose and give people the information they deserve about the food they eat. 
The Australian government has 
introduced new Country of Origin food labeling. Arnott’s has started applying these easy-to-understand labels across Campbell’s® soups, simple meals, stocks and V8® juices. The new labels tell 
consumers at a glance where their food is grown, produced, made or packed and also shows what percentage of the ingredients come from Australia.
Our Arnott’s business also continues 
to roll out Health Star Ratings across the entire portfolio. This front-of-pack labeling system provides a quick, standard way to compare similar packaged foods, helping consumers to easily make informed decisions about the foods they buy.
Campbell Leads on GMO Transparency 
In 2016, Campbell became the first major food company to support a mandatory national labeling standard for products that contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We’ve put that stance into action by labeling all U.S. products that contain ingredients derived from GMO crops. The decisions we have made with regard to GMOs have not been because we dispute the science behind GMOs or their safety. The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence indicates that GMOs are safe and that foods derived from crops using genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different from other foods. Instead, the decision was guided by our Purpose and our commitment to be open and honest about our food. GMO labeling is a practice that the majority of Americans support, and we believe it is the right thing to do for consumers and for our business.

Imagine if people could leave behind 
the trial and error of fad diets, and instead gain their own “nutrition intuition.” That idea was the inspiration for Habit, a new company in which Campbell is the sole investor. Think of Habit as a personal nutritionist and eating coach. The company began with a pilot in San Francisco, California, and is now available nationally. The pilot yielded valuable insights for Habit and Campbell as we continue to serve consumers seeking to lead healthier lives. Neil Grimmer, Habit CEO and co-founder of Plum Organics, shares the personal journey that changed his outlook on food.Inside the Personalized Nutrition Revolution  with Habit’s CEO
I’ve always wanted to get more from my food. In my early 30s, I helped start and run Plum Organics and was 
so focused on bringing the best, healthy food to kids that I lost sight of my own health. Too much work, too much food and mega-dosing of caffeine, combined with not enough sleep, healthy food or exercise was a damaging, but all too common, lifestyle. One day, I looked in the mirror and saw a stranger. 
I was 50 pounds heavier than my weight 10 years prior, and my unhealthy startup lifestyle was leading me 
to some serious health issues. With guidance from physicians and nutritionists, I learned that much of what I was battling could be resolved—not with pharmaceuticals or fad diets—but with real, healthy, whole food, in amounts and ratios that were optimized specifically for me.
I wanted this type of health transformation to be available to anyone. That’s how Habit was born. Habit brings 
together a brilliant team of scientists, registered dietitians, nutritionists, technologists, food scientists, health coaches, designers and business leaders. We’re on a mission to feed human potential through the power of personalized nutrition, and through Habit, we believe food can transform lives, one plate at a time.

Consumer desires are changing, 
shifting toward ingredients and products that promote health and well-being. And technology is transforming the way we learn about, purchase and prepare what we eat. That’s why Campbell is developing an ecosystem of innovative partners who are defining the future of food. Explore the many ways we’re bringing about a new kind of food system. 
In early 2016, we announced the 
formation of a venture capital fund that will invest $125 million in innovative companies across the food system. To date, this fund has made commitments to companies like Farmers Business Network, Back to the Roots and Pilotworks (formerly Foodworks). 
Another investment includes Spoiler 
Alert, whose technology platform helps food businesses manage their unsold inventory and increase food access nationwide. Through this investment, Spoiler Alert will begin tackling the food waste problem in the U.S., which amounts to $220 billion in wasted food every year. Real Food Innovation Challenge  
Campbell is now working with Pilotworks, a kitchen incubator dedicated to growing early-stage retail and wholesale food businesses. Through this relationship, we’ll help support up-and-coming innovators with a passion for real food. We kicked off in summer 2017 with the Real Food Innovation Challenge at their commercial kitchens in Brooklyn, New York. Campbell invited Pilotworks members to participate in an idea pitch session, and out of nearly 40 entries, Campbell selected seven finalists to present their ideas to judges in front  
of a live audience. 
To choose the winners, the judges 
used criteria influenced by Campbell’s Purpose and Real Food Philosophy. The three winners—Red Velvet NYC, Better Almond Butter and Watermelon Road—received credits to apply to their Pilotworks memberships. As a second part of the partnership, these winners and other Pilotworks members will have access to professional advice on topics such as branding, marketing, product development and packaging—in the form of nearly 20 Campbell experts.

MassChallenge
MassChallenge calls itself “the most startup-friendly accelerator on the planet.” With the PULSE@ MassChallenge program, a component of the Mass Digital Health Initiative, the accelerator plays matchmaker between promising digital health companies and business and health care experts. An important component of the program is the “reverse pitch” process, in which potential investors tell entrepreneurs what sorts of initiatives they’d like to fund. In its first year as a Champion partner, Campbell paired with AARP to encourage entrepreneurs to submit ideas related to: 
• Food that enhances sustained mental and physical energy
• Food that helps prevent chronic disease, like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease  • Technologies that can help people prepare foods that are tastier, more nutritious and more affordable  
Funders and startups were matched at the end of 2017, and the accelerator began in early 2018. At the end of the program, $200,000 will be distributed to program winners to scale their ideas.  Chef’d® Campbell believes that the future of grocery shopping is digital. Today, only a small percentage of our food is sold online, but we believe that our industry is headed for a disruption like the ones that transformed how we buy music, clothing and other goods. By 2021, Campbell expects e-commerce sales of food and beverages to reach $66 billion, growing at a compound annual rate of 38 percent. 
One way we’ll leverage this opportunity 
is by partnering with companies that are already cracking the e-commerce code, like online meal kit company Chef’d. Chef’d enables people to choose and reorder from hundreds of meals at any given time, without the hassle and cost of subscriptions or membership fees. Chef’d partners with notable chefs, culinary personalities and over 125 trusted brands to offer more than 1,000 meal solutions. 
With our $10 million investment and 
strategic partnership with the company, Chef’d will help us with infrastructure and distribution of meal solutions through Campbell’s Kitchen™. We’ll also 
benefit from insights on e-commerce business models, data analytics and shopper behaviors. Over the next three years, we will work together to test new capabilities related to product innovation and fulfillment. As our grocery shopping carts become increasingly virtual, we look forward to seeing where this partnership leads. 
 “In the future, 
shopping for and preparing meals 
will be flexible, fully 
automated and even anticipatory. Chef’d 
will help Campbell 
connect with our 
consumers where they 
are today and, more importantly, where 
they’re headed.”

Campbell Healthy Communities 
established the Healthy Corner  Store Network, which is designed to increase access to affordable, healthy food in low-income neighborhoods  by providing technical assistance to store owners. In Camden, a city of 77,000 residents with no full-service grocery store, corner stores are a  key to healthy food access in the  
city. Of 50 participating corner stores,  
90 percent reported increases in  
sales of healthy foods at their  
locations after the program began. 
The program has expanded to include 
Heart Smarts, a supplementary program that provides onsite health screenings, in-store nutrition education and cooking lessons as well as distribution of Heart Bucks, coupons that are redeemed for healthy food. The impact has been widespread. Take Edward, a local Camden resident. In early 2015, Edward would visit a local corner store every day to purchase lottery tickets. After being convinced to try an in-store nutrition education lesson, he liked it so much that he returned for 10 more lessons and was an active participant in health screenings and Heart Bucks redemption. Edward, who had uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes, not only lost 40 pounds over the course of the year, but also decreased his A1C levels from 12.7 percent to 5.2 percent.
“The program changed my life 
completely,” Edward said. “It’s all because of the nutrition education lessons in the store, the Heart Bucks coupons and help from my doctor that I’ve been able to make such a drastic change in my life.”
Building a Network of Real Solutions
In December of 2016, Campbell’s Metro Detroit Healthy Communities program held a Special Pantry with Forgotten Harvest and Gleaners Community Food Bank, along with our school site, Ferndale Lower Elementary. Families in need were invited to our Special Pantry to receive food to help them prepare a worry-free holiday dinner and more. 
More than 100 local families attended 
the event on a snowy afternoon. Every participating family received a ham or turkey, bread, fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables, dairy products, fresh pies and other items needed for daily meal preparation. The local Garden Fresh Gourmet team used a Ferndale community Facebook site to ask neighbors to donate grocery store gift cards for each family, and, with the community’s help, every family also received a $25 gift card to a neighborhood grocery store. Through the collaboration of a few local organizations and the Ferndale, Michigan, community, we ensured that more than 100 families were food-secure during the holiday season.

What you have for breakfast can set 
the tone for the rest of your day. Eating whole grains can lead to healthier choices—and knowing your meal is helping another person can jumpstart  a day of doing good. 
That was the driving force for four 
Campbell employees—a marketing manager, a design manager, an R&D scientist and a chef—who founded The Soulfull Project, a “buy one, give one” Public Benefit Corporation and certified B Corp. For each serving of hot cereal the company sells, another serving is donated to a food bank to feed someone in need. 
The team developed their cereals in 
collaboration with the Food Bank of South Jersey, who helped the team identify breakfast as the meal during which it is hardest for their patrons to make healthy choices. Partnering with the food bank, Soulfull developed its first product, Four Grain Hot Cereal, a combination of rye, oats, barley and red quinoa with no added sugar, a rare quality for breakfast foods. It was a welcome alternative for food bank patrons, many of whom live with chronic health issues like diabetes. 
A Delicious Difference
Since its inception, Campbell Soup 
Company has funded The Soulfull Project. The founders pitched their idea to the company’s senior leaders, and Campbell responded with funding, resources—including the use of the pilot plant at Campbell’s world headquarters—
and connections to suppliers. The newly 
certified B Corp is now in the process of expanding nationally, adding capacity in R&D and sales. 
More Than Just Breakfast 
Donating food has never been  
The Soulfull Project’s only goal. The company’s founders also wanted to give back in their own communities. To celebrate local communities and inspire action, Soulfull kicked off its  
first product launch in 2016 with “The Soulfull 100.” The campaign consisted of 100 volunteer events held over 100 days. The events, which were chronicled on social media, drove brand recognition and served as a daily reminder of Soulfull’s mission. The stories struck a chord: over the three-month period, Soulfull’s Facebook followers grew from 300  
to more than 19,000, and the company gained more than 200 nonprofit  
giving partners nationwide. 
The Soulfull Project has inspired many 
across the nation and within our own walls. The startup has introduced us to new business models and ways to engage consumers. Recently, the Soulfull team was asked to speak to participants in an internal “Shark Tank”–inspired employee competition, one of many efforts helping employees live into one of Campbell’s core Values, “Own It Like a Founder.”

 Five years ago, a team of Campbell 
employees put their heads together with the Food Bank of South Jersey to address a major food waste dilemma: supermarkets often won’t accept undersized or misshapen produce, despite its being perfectly safe and nutritious to eat. This leads to millions of pounds of fresh, nourishing fruits and vegetables being wasted every year, even while many communities, like our New Jersey hometown, face food insecurity. We thought there must be a way to address both of these challenges at once—and Just Peachy was born. Since 2012, Just Peachy salsa has rescued some of the 800,000 pounds of peaches thrown away each year by just one farmer’s cooperative in southern New Jersey. We make the salsa in our pilot plant in Camden, New Jersey, and employees volunteer to package each new batch. Just Peachy salsa is sold at more than 100 New Jersey retailers, including farmer’s markets, restaurants and select ShopRite stores, and all profits support hunger relief programs at the Food 
Bank of South Jersey. It’s a peachy deal 
for the planet and everyone involved: growers, Campbell employees, the Food Bank and salsa lovers alike. Feeding People, Ending Food Waste:  That’s Just Peachy

Arnott’s Indonesia
• The Indonesian government has 
made a pledge to clean up garbage across the country by 2020. An Arnott’s team, along with local community leaders, participated in a cleanup day on Kenjeran Beach in Surabaya. To help with ongoing efforts, Arnott’s donated mountain bikes that will help sanitation teams clean up the country even faster. 
• Partnering with YCAB, a local youth development organization, Arnott’s will offer computer lessons to underprivileged children. An Arnott’s-branded van will serve as a classroom on wheels, carrying enough laptops for 10 students and a teacher. The program will operate for one year, during which Arnott’s will help educate more than 200 children. 
Arnott’s Malaysia
• Children everywhere need the right tools to succeed in school. For its “Bag to School” initiative, Arnott’s identified 188 primary school students in need across three schools in the Klang Valley. Employees sponsored children by donating school bags, supplies and water bottles, with Arnott’s matching their donations. 
• The Lighthouse Children’s Welfare Home in Bangsar got a surprise when Arnott’s delivered lunchboxes packed with healthy foods—plus a few treats to enjoy. Employees packed 100 lunchboxes with fruits, vegetables and Campbell’s® soup, and “party packs” with Tim Tam®, Shapes® and Good Time® cookies.

Supporting Healthy Communities in Campbell’s Hometowns
Founded in 1953, the Campbell Soup Foundation provides finan-cial support to local organizations that inspire positive change in communities where Campbell employees live and work. The Foundation’s grantmaking focuses on strategic giving to strengthen and empower healthy communities in Campbell’s home-towns. The Foundation is entirely employee-run, governed by a Board of Trustees comprised of senior executives, and advised by an employee-led Executive Committee. In FY2017, the Foundation provided $1.7 million in grants, including a youth urban farming program and mobile teaching kitchen in Camden, New Jersey, as well as a food waste and recovery program in Bloomfield, Connecticut.
A Record Year for The Arnott’s Foundation
In FY2017, The Arnott’s Foundation had a record year of giving, granting more than $517,000 USD to deserving nonprofits across Australia. Of the total amount donated, $461,000 was donated to Camp Quality and $56,000 was donated to Fairy Sparkle. On top of this, over $1.5 million of product was donated to Foodbank and $39,000 was donated to Driver Reviver. 
What makes The Arnott’s Foundation unique is that the majority of funds are 
raised by employees and the Arnott’s community. Through direct giving and fundraising events, the Foundation was able to further its mission to create positive environments that allow families to build, maintain and enjoy a better quality of life.

1 To drive consistency in our reporting metrics, sustainable agriculture data will be reported over fiscal year (FY) instead of calendar year (CY) moving forward. This means that 
the FY2017 tomato data under “Grown” in this Report is a restatement of CY2017 tomato data from last year’s Report.
2 We are restating our historic data because of improved data completeness and quality and full integration of data from our three most recent acquisitions completed through 
FY2017. Total waste has increased significantly compared to prior reports because we added animal feed waste for one of our acquistions, which previously we were not 
able to obtain data on.

• Developed a partnership with Dietitian Connection, an online network of 
dietitians in Australia. Through this 
partnership, Arnott’s engages with

Our panel of Scientific Advisors is made up 
of respected food and nutrition scientists 
from leading universities and private 
organizations. In December 2016, they reviewed our nutrition strategy and health and wellness reporting as benchmarked 
against key competitors. They commended 
our efforts to provide fact-based information 
with websites like www.whatsinmyfood.com  
and our dedication to transparency. The panel believes our criteria and reporting metrics are strong measurements of our commitment to health, but encouraged more transparency about the criteria. The 
panel recommended we create policies 
on our stance around food science and 
controversies. In FY2018, the panel will work with us to develop position statements on sensitive issues available for consumers 
and investors. This will be our first step to 
meet the panel’s recommendations to be 
even more transparent about our stance on important nutrition and health issues.
In order to help Campbell identify and prioritize our most relevant issues related to corporate responsibility, we conducted an in-depth materiality assessment in FY2016. This process allowed us to better understand how the priorities and concerns of external stakeholders align with our business priorities and corporate responsibility objectives. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards mandate that organizations do a materiality assessment as part of their reporting process to inform what are the most critical—or “material”—issues to report. 
Campbell defines material corporate 
responsibility issues as those that influence the judgment and decisions of our external and internal stakeholders and have an impact on our stakeholders and business today and in the future. In order to identify the key issues of importance, we seek the input of a variety of stakeholder groups and measure the risks and opportunities for all relevant environmental, social and governance topics. Our goal in this process is to help inform our overall corporate responsibility strategies, set priorities and ensure that our annual Corporate Responsibility Report communicates how we are managing those material issues.
Our assessment adhered to the 
following steps:
Step 1: Identification of Issues
We reviewed publicly available corporate responsibility communications of our peer set, including corporate responsibility reports, press releases and corporate websites, to analyze what issues and initiatives currently are of priority across our industry. We then conducted a thorough media audit of trade, corporate responsibility and mainstream media outlets to understand what issues are trending and of the highest concern in the news. We also had conversations with various NGOs, investors and corporate responsibility organizations to confirm our findings. 
Step 2: Stakeholder Survey 
We organized a widespread survey of global employees, customers (retailers), suppliers, NGOs, community partners, government or regulatory agencies, investors, trade organizations and consumers. The survey was not only sent directly to targeted external stakeholders, but was also posted publicly on Twitter and LinkedIn to gather input from as varied an audience as possible. In total, we received responses from more than 1,250 survey participants.
Step 3: Stakeholder Interviews
To further vet the issues and rankings as identified by the survey results, we conducted detailed stakeholder interviews. Sustainable Brands interviewed five internal stakeholders, while Business for Social Responsibility interviewed five external stakeholders. In addition, we Healthy: Products that meet the FDA criteria for healthy, a Health Star Rating of 3.5 or higher, comply with Health Canada, or Mexico Dietary Guidelines.
Presence of Positives: Products that 
have increased positive nutrients or food groups such as potassium, fiber, and vegetable servings. These products must also meet upper limits for negative nutrients such as sodium, sugar, and saturated fat.
Absence of Negatives: Products that 
are reduced in negative nutrients like sodium, saturated fat, and sugar. These products must also meet upper limits for all negative nutrients in order to be classified under this category.

Step 4: ValidationCampbell’s Sustainability Steering Committee met to review the findings and validate the issues. These issues were then presented to various company leaders who also provided their input on the importance of these issues to Campbell’s overall company strategies. 
Based on the results of these steps, we 
created a materiality grid, which maps where our long-term business success aligns with marketplace and stakeholder priorities. We will utilize these findings to identify and validate opportunities for strengthening our corporate responsibility 
strategies and reporting in the future.Materiality, cont.

In FY2017, Campbell went through a more in-depth water risk 
assessment using the WRI Aqueduct tool to assess current and 
future water risk at our facilities globally. Our highest overall water 
risk currently is at our Bekasi, Indonesia, facility. Water quality risks 
exist at our sites in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Utah 
and in Marleston, Australia. Risks related to water quantity are of 
highest priority for our facilities in Australia, California, Connecticut, 
Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Utah. Our facilities in Australia, California, 
Connecticut, Indonesia, Michigan and Utah are at high risk of baseline 
water stress. The risk of flooding is extremely high at our Downers 
Grove, Illinois, facility. Finally, upstream storage, which impacts water 
supply, is extremely low around our facilities in Indonesia, Illinois, 
Michigan and Ohio. This indicates that these locations could have trouble buffering variations in water supply from events such as droughts and floods. Campbell has also analyzed future water risk projections for 2020, 2030 and 2040 for facilities located in Australia, California, Connecticut, Indonesia, Malaysia, Michigan, New Jersey and Utah. This is consistent with the current geographic water risk across our portfolio with two additions, Malaysia and  
New Jersey. While we have water reduction goals at our global manufacturing sites, we will be using this data to expand our risk management considerations for facilities with high water quantity and quality risks to ensure that Campbell can positively impact water supply, access to safe and clean water, and biodiversity that can be impacted by changes in water quantity and quality.

Campbell Soup Company has an Environmental Management 
System with one of the key aspects being an electronic system, the Campbell’s Environmental Management & Metrics System (CEMMS). The CEMMS system is used globally at our facilities and is the backbone of our overall Environmental Management System. The CEMMS system addresses our document management, permit tracking, monitoring and measurement, tasks and calendar management, waste and recycling tracking/reporting, inspection notifications, incidents of notice of violations management, audits management, energy tracking/reporting and refrigerant tracking/reporting. While this system is auditable and supports ISO 14001, our Environmental Management System is not ISO 14001 certified, and we currently do not have any facilities that are ISO 14001 or OHSAS 18001 certified.103-2 The management approach and its components
