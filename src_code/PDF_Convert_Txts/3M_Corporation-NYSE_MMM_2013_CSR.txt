3M Sustainability Definition 
3M defines sustainability using the United 
Nation’s Brundtland Commission’s definition, 
"meeting the needs of society today while respecting the ability of future generations to 
meet their needs." Our definition is further 
informed by the work for the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development, Global 
Reporting Initiative, Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and others who define sustainability as 
encompassing environmental stewardship, 
economic success, and social responsibility.  
These three pillars are further defined by th e 
topics covered in this report .

INTRODUCTION  
 
INVENTING TOMORROW  -SUSTAINING OUR FUTURE  
 
3M does not have a separate sustainability 
initiative.  
 
It is simply part of who we are and what 
we do.  
 Initiatives speak of focus groups… of start-up dates… end dates… buzzwords.  
They tend to spring from what other companies do.  They are a reaction.  
 For more than 40 years, 3M has been a leader among global corporations in 
sustainability actions and measures, 
beginning with the cre ation of its ground -
breaking Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) Program in 1975  to a broad portfolio of sustainable product 
today.  
 
As a global corporation, we believe that we have a very real and sincere responsibility to society, in 
general, and especially t o the communities in which we live and work.  That is important from an 
environmental stewardship perspective, as well as a key competitive strategy.  
 
Our corporate vision states that  3M technology advances every company…  
3M products enhance every home… a nd 3M innovation improves every life.   
 
It is that vision – that focuses  on our customers’ needs and well- being – that guides our sustainability 
strategies and goals, the respect we demonstrate for our social and physical environments.  
 
Our sustainability  strategies are built upon three key principles:  environmental stewardship , social 
responsibility, and economic success.  By demonstrating global leadership within each of these powerful principles, 3M will continue to successfully deliver on its corporat e vision.  
 
Our f ocus on environmental stewardship  dictates how we do what we do.  It guides our design ethic, our 
manufacturing processes, and our means of distribution.  
 
Our focus on social responsibility means engaging in deep, meaningful conversations w ith our key 
stakeholders – our customers, our shareholders, our employees, and our communities – to ensure that 
we are acting as responsibly and as ethically as possible and that we are furthering our leadership 
position within our sustainability operation s. 
 
6 
 Our focus on economic success enables us to create impactful, innovative sustainable solutions today… 
and far into the future.  
 Our corporate vision, crafted with our customers and end users firmly in mind, is inextricably linked with 
our sustainability strategies.  Our culture of innovation, collaboration, the sharing  of technologies across 
platforms and business units, ultimately supports these guiding questions:  How can we best meet the 
articulated and unarticulated needs of our global customers and partners?  How can we harness the 
chain reaction of new ideas to not only invent the products of the future, but also do so in a way that 
creates the smallest footprint upon our precious planet?   
 
Our sustainability measures begin with the germ of an idea and are carried through every step of 
processes that deliver innovative products into the hands of our customers throughout the world.  Our 
partners and customers consistently turn to us for sustainability solutions within their own manufac turing 
processes.  We share our knowledge regularly and to the greater benefit of the worldwide community.  
 
We know that what we and our partners do today will have an impact far into the future.  We act to meet the needs of society today, while respecting  the needs of future generations.  
 At 3M, we don’t have a sustainability initiative.  
We have a sustainability culture.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
EXECUTIVE MESSAGE  
At 3M, we are working hard to help create a better world for people everywhere.  We apply our ing enuity, 
our expertise and our technology to solve problems innovatively, and with a focus on solutions for the 
longer term.  Sustainability is fundamental to our business philosophy – from product development and 
manufacturing to how customers use our products.   
 
Our Enduring Commitment  
For decades, 3M has pioneered sustainable business practices with outstanding results. Our 3P Program – Pollution Prevention Pays —is now in its thirty -eighth year .  Over the years, this innovative, world -
leading program has prevented 3. 8 billion pounds of pollution.  And that’s not all -  our efforts have 
reduced greenhouse gas emissions by  nearly 70 percent.  
 
We have created hundreds of sustainable solutions and product platforms to help our customers manage 
their enviro nmental footprint – from paint systems that reduce the need for cleaning solvents and 
window films that ease energy consumption to a greener tape that is made with plant -based adhesive 
and film.  
 
But we know there is much more to do.  3M and its customers  face ongoing challenges such as energy 
reduction and efficient use of raw materials.  When we look upon these challenges, we apply 3M innovation to overcome them, for our company, for our customers and for our communities.  
 
Our 2015 Sustainability Goals  
Sustainability is a real- world business initiative that is woven into the culture of 3M.  
We are building on our years of success to further reduce our environmental footprint. Our goal is to 
reduce volatile air emissions 15 percent by 2015, reduce solid was te 10 percent and improve energy 
efficiency by 25 percent, all from a 2010 base.  
 Our sustainability goals also measure progress on social responsibility and economic issues.  For 
example, we aim to increase sales of 3M products that offer environmental a dvantages and we are 
developing and implementing water conservation plans in areas with scarce or stressed water resources.   
 Sustainability will continue to be a vital focus as we work to truly advance every company, enhance every 
home and improve every life.

 11 
 3M BOARD OF DIRECTORS  
 
 
3M’s Board Structure and leadership is characterized by : 
 
• A combined Chairman of the Board and  CEO .  
• A  strong, independent and highly experience d lead director with well defined respons ibilities 
that support the Board’s oversight responsibilities  
• A robust committee structure comprised entirely of independent directors with oversight of 
various types of risks  
• An engaged and independent Board.  
 
The Board believes  that this leadership structure provides independent Board leadership and 
engagement while deriving the benefit of having our CEO also serve as Chairman of the Board.  As the 
individual with primary responsibility for managing the Company’s day to day operations and with in 
depth knowledge and understanding of the Company, he is best posit ioned to chair regular Board 
meetings as the directors discuss key business and strategic issues.  Coupled with an independent Lead 
Director, this combined structure provides independent oversight while avoiding unnecessary confusion 
regarding the Board’s oversight r esponsibilities and the data to day management of business operations.  
 The Board believes that adopting a rigid policy on whether to separate or combine the positions  of 
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) would inhibit the Board’s ability to provide for a 
leadership structure that would best serve stockholders. As a result, the Board has rejected adopting a 
policy permanently separating or combining  the positions of Chairman and CEO in its Corporate 
12 
 Governance Guidelines. Th e Board believes that combining the roles of CEO and Chairman contributes to 
an efficient and effective Board to drive change and continuous  improvement within the company.  
Tempered by respect for 3M’s traditions and values, the CEO must have maximum auth ority.  
 
The CEO is primarily responsible for effectively leading significant change, improving operational 
efficiency, driving growth, managing the Company’s day to day business, managing the various risk facing the Company, and reinforcing the expectation  for all employees of continuing to build on 3M’s 
century old tradition of uncompromising honesty and integrity.  
 
The Board believes that the Company’s corporate governance measures ensure that strong independent 
directors continue to effectively oversee t he Company’s management and key issues related to executive 
compensation, CEO evaluation and succession planning, strategy, risk and integrity.  The Corporate 
Governance Guidelines provide in part that (i) independent  directors comprise a substantial major ity of 
the Board; (ii) directors are elected annually with majority vote standard in uncontested director elections; (iii) only independent  directors serve on the Audit, Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and 
Governance Committees; (iv) the committee ch airs establish their respective agenda; (v) the Board and 
committees may retain their own advisors; (vi) the independent directors  have complete access to 
management and employees (vii) the independent  meet in executive session without the CEO or other 
employees during each regular Board meeting; and ( viii) the Board and each committee regularly 
conduct a self evaluation to determine whether it and its committees function effectively.  The Board has 
also designated one of its members to serve as Lead Direct or, with responsibilities  that are similar to 
those typically performed by an independent chairman.  
 
Board Skills and Responsibilities

Board committees, ref er to 3M’s 2013 Proxy Statement and 2012 Annual Report. 
S
HAREHOLDER AND STAKEHOLDER INPUT 
3M values shareholder and stakeholder input.  The Board of Directors has adopted the following process for stockholders and other interested parties to send communications to members of the Board. 
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Lead Director, the chairs of the 
Audit, Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Governance Committees of the Board, or with any of 
our other indepe ndent directors,  or all of them as a group, by sending a letter to the following address: 
Corporate Secretary, 3M Company, 3M Center, Building 220 -13E-34, St. Paul, MN 55144- 1000 
 
     13 
 SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE  
The Corporate Operating Committee, which is comprised of the CEO and his direct reports, approves 3M-
wide sustainability principles, strategy, and goals, and any associated major changes.  Executive 
committees associated with the strategic sustainability functions (comprised of cross functional 
members) help set and approve relevant policies and provide direction on executing the developed sustainability strategies.  
For example, the EHS Committee, appointed by the Corporate Operating Committee is composed of the following functions:  
•  Senior vice president of corporate supply chain operations  
•  Executive vice president of research and development and chief technology officer  
•  Vice president of EHS operations  
•  Vice president of public affairs  
•  Vice president of corporate research laboratory and international technical operations  
•  Vice president and medical director medical department  
•  Vice president of compliance and business conduct  
•  Vice president and general manager of Materials Resource Division  
•  Technical director of t he Materials Resource Division  
•  Assistant general council  
 
3M's Corporate Environmental Initiatives and Sustainability Group within the Environmental, Health, and 
Safety corporate staff organization collaborates with the various other global staff organ izations and 
business units to develop the corporate sustainability strategy and goals.  In addition 3M’s  corporate staff 
groups provide technical ex pertise to assist business groups  and area management in implementing and 
meeting the corporate sustainability strategy, policies, and goals.  
 
In January 2013,  3M CEO Inge Thulin formed the Sustainability Center of Excellence by appointing two 
Vice Presidents to the Center.  One to focus on developing and commercializing products which help our customers solve their sustainability challenges and the other to ensure sustainability within 3M 
operations  and supply chain.  Both VPs report to the Executive Vice President of 3M Supply Chain who 
reports to the CEO.  The formation of the Sustainability Center of Excellence demonstrates the commitment of the corporation to integrate innovation and sustainability for the benefit of our operations 
and our customers.  The primary role of the Center is to develop strategy, set significant goals to track progress and dr ive sustainable actions throughout 3M.  
Identifying Opportunities & Risks Related to Sustainable Development  
The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee through its charter the primary responsibility for  
the oversight of risks facing the Company.  The charter provides that the Audit Committee shall ‘‘discuss  
policies and procedures with respect to risk assessment and risk management, the Company’s major  
risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate such exposures.’’  
The Vice President and General Auditor, Corporate Auditing (‘‘Auditor’’), whose appointment and  
performance is reviewed and evaluated by the Audit Committee and who has direct reporting obligations  
to the Audit Committee, is responsible for leadin g the formal risk assessment and management process  
within the Company.  The Auditor, through consultation with the Company’s senior management,  
periodically assesses the major risks facing the Company and works with those executives responsible  
for managing each specific risk.  The Auditor periodically reviews with the Audit Committee the major  14 
 risks facing the Company and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate those risks.  The  
Auditor’s risk management report, which is provided in advance of the meeting, is reviewed with the  
entire Board by either the Chair of the Audit Committee or the Auditor.  The executive responsible for  
managing a particular risk may also report to the full Board on how the risk is being managed and  
mitigated.  
 
While the Board’s primary oversight of risk is with the Audit Committee, the Board has delegated to  
other committees the oversight of risks within their areas of responsibility and expertise. For example,  
the Compensation Committee oversees the risks ass ociated with the Company’s compensation  
practices, including an annual review of the Company’s risk assessment of its compensation policies  
and practices for its employees.  The Finance Committee oversees risks associated with the Company’s  
capital structu re, its credit ratings and its cost of capital, long -term benefit obligations, and the  
Company’s use of or investment in financial products, including derivatives used to manage risk related  
to foreign currencies, commodities, and interest rates.  The Nominating and Governance Committee  
oversees the risks associated with the Company’s overall governance and its succession planning  
process to understand that the Company has a slate of future, qualified candidates for key management  
positions.  
 The Board beli eves that its oversight of risks, primarily through delegation to the Audit Committee,  
but also through delegation to other committees to oversee specific risks within their areas of  
responsibility and expertise, and the sharing of information with the full Board, is appropriate for a  
diversified technology and manufacturing company like 3M.  The chair of each committee that oversees  
risk provides a summary of the matters discussed with the committee to the full Board following each  
committee meeting.  The minutes of each committee meeting are also provided to all Board members.  
The Board also believes its oversight of risk is enhanced by its current leadership structure (discussed  
above) because the CEO, who is ultimately responsible for the Company’s management of risk, also  
chairs regular Board meetings, and with his in -depth knowledge and understanding of the Company, is  
best able to bring key business issues and risks to the Board’s attention.  
 
3M conducts extensive interviews, group assessments, an d reviews by senior management for 
completion of risk analysis assessments to  provide more customized and useful prioritized results.   This 
process assures that  the appropriate risks are properly identified as an enterprise risk, to identify key “failure modes” that could lead to a risk incident, and to review and assess the quality of ownership of 
the risk and related resources available to assure proper avoidance, mitigation, and response 
capabilities.   A gap assessment is completed  to provide quantific ation on a common scale of the level of 
risk and 3M’s corresponding capabilities relative to each enterprise risk identified.  The outcomes are 
used to prioritize action plans for each topic.  More detailed quantitative and qualitative sensitivity 
analyses  may be conducted and cover topics such as  operational risk (business continuity), raw material 
sourcing and price fluctuation, compliance, revenue forecasting , climate change legislation, petroleum 
pricing and st rategic planning processes, amo ng many othe r areas.   
The Board of Directors Public Issues Committee review public policy issues and trends affecting the 
company.  The committee reviews and approves the company’s response to stockholder proposals 
relating to public policy issues.  The  Board of D irectors has determined that all Public Issues Committee 
members are independent under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards.  
 
  15 
 With complex global operations and a wide range of businesses and market s, developing 3M public 
policy pr iorities  can be a challenge.  3M manages this by working with local, national and international 
government agencies and through membership organizations.  Each country has an evaluation process.  
For example, in the United States, an evaluation process dev eloped by the 3M Public Affairs Department 
establishes a public policy agenda of issues impacting our businesses.  Internationally, 3M managing directors of host country businesses are responsible for evaluating and determining key government 
issues in their respective countries.  PUBLIC POLICY  
 
Top Public Policy Issues  
The Top -10 list of Priority Public Policy Issues serves as a roadmap for company activities to include 
lobbying, trade association work, executive involvement, political contributions, grassroots 
communications and advocacy involving employees and retirees, as well as meetings with federal and 
state government officials.  In selecting which priority issues make 3M's Top -10 list, the company uses a 
number of screens. Chief among these screens are issues with  the potential to significantly affect 3M's 
financial performance and/or our corporate reputation.  Other screens are immediacy of impact on the 
company; situations in which 3M may be uniquely advantaged or disadvantaged; importance based on instinct and/or history; or employee/retiree satisfaction.  This list of priorities helps the Corporate Public 
Affairs team focus on those issues that have the greatest impact on the company.  Finally, and probably 
most importantly, the Top -10 list of issues helps to en sure that the many faces of 3M always speak with 
a single, unified voice and it serves as the guide for advancing 3M's public policy goals and growth -
through- government objectives.  
 Example: Top 10 3M Public Policy Issues in the United States (as of March 2013)
 
 
(1) Tax Policy − Tax reform is essential to ensuring the long -term competitiveness of American 
businesses and workers.  3M believes business tax reform should focus on a significant reduction of the 
corporate income tax rate, transitioning to a territorial system, and creating incentives for U.S. -based IP 
ownership . In addition, state tax policy should incentivize capital investment and sustainable job creation 
by rewarding plant expansion and modernization investments, and efforts to increase em ployment.  
(2) Regulatory Reform − The U.S. regulatory environment plays a vital role in advancing the nation’s 
economic security interests. So as to promote genuine competition and sustainable job creation, 
regulatory reforms must include thorough cost -benefit and risk assessments, while preserving the 
highest standards for safety, quality and efficiency. Efforts by certain federal agencies to extend their regulatory reach without congressional oversight must also be curtailed.  
(3) Sustainability/Environmental Policy − 3M's strategies for sustainable development encompass the 
pursuit of customer satisfaction and commercial success within a framework of environmental, social and economic values.  To that end, 3M has made significant investments designed to reduce  the 
environmental footprint of our operations, investments which continue today .  And by developing 
sustainable products, we help our customers reduce their environmental footprint and help to meet their sustainability goals
.  Finally, 3M believes environmental policy and regulations should be guided by 
science- based decision making.  
(4)  Health Care Policy – The U.S. health system should remain market -driven and efforts to address the 
uninsured should not weaken the current employer -based coverage s ystem. Implementation of the 16 
 federal health care law should focus on increasing efficiencies within the system as well as improving 
quality outcomes and patient safety.  
(5) Energy Policy – National (and state) energy policy should ensure a continuous, reliable and 
uninterrupted supply of energy at competitive rates.  3M supports policies that address new sources of 
energy, alternative energy, faster adoption of technology and improved energy  efficiency.  
(6) Homeland Security  – 3M believes our nation’s homeland security and defense preparedness should 
be strengthened through improved border and immigration security, improved force protection measures, 
additional support for first responders, and planning for pandemics or other national emergencies.  
(7) Legal Reform/Patent Policy –The U.S. legal system is the most expensive in the world, driven often 
by lawsuit abuse.  To ensure the legal justice system is fair, efficient and consistent, we sup port reforms 
making liability litigation more equitable, subjecting punitive damages to reasonable caps, and ending 
destructive practices like indiscriminate screening, venue shopping and case bundling.  Such reforms 
can be achieved while ensuring that those injured by faulty products receive fair compensation proportionate to the injury of the claimant and the fault of the defendant.  3M believes in strongly 
supporting patent rights for innovators and patent holders across this nation and globally.  We sup port 
the implementation of the recent patent reform law to enhance the resources and capabilities of the 
United States Patent and Trademark Office, improve the quality and transparency of the patenting 
process, and bring more balance, objectivity and predictability to patent infringement litigation.  We 
support efforts, both in the U.S. and in patent offices and courts globally, to enhance the enforceability of 
patent rights against infringing activities and the remedies available against infringement.    
(8) International Trade Policy  – The U.S. economy and American jobs depend on the expansion of free 
and fair trade through the passage of new trade agreements.  3M supports renewal of the president’s 
Trade Promotion Authority so as to allow additional agreements to be negotiated. International trade policy also requires a level playing field, including recognition, protection, and enforcement of intellectual prope rty rights and trading rules.  
(9) Labor Policy – 3M supports the full measure of rights provided to employers and employees under 
the National Labor Relations Act.  However, we strongly oppose actions by the National Labor Relations 
Board that challenge U .S. manufacturing leadership.  We also oppose any legislative or regulatory efforts 
to diminish or eliminate secret ballot elections for employees as relates to either accepting or rejecting 
union representation.  3M invests in STEM initiatives that encour age and support student interest and 
achievement. We also support reform of our immigration system to ensure American companies are able to hire those with advanced degrees in STEM fields so we can continue to grow and innovate in the U.S.   
 (10) Transpor tation Infrastructure Policy – The maintenance and improvement of the nation’s 
transportation infrastructure – which is important to 3M as a supplier of traffic safety and construction 
products, and as a user of the system –  can only be achieved if the Hig hway Trust Fund remains solvent.  
3M believes all highway user fees should be dedicated to the fund; additional steps should be taken to 
crack down on fuel tax evasion; and Congress should consider other measures, if necessary, to ensure the fund’s solvenc y.

 BUSINESS CONDUCT
• a core set of business conduct policies;  At 3M, we believe that what the company stands for is just as important as what we sell. For 110 years, 
3M has operated with uncompromising honesty and integrity. 3M’s global compliance program is 
managed and administered by  the Compliance and Business Conduct department, led by the vice 
president, Compliance and Business Conduct, who is also the corporation’s Chief Compliance Officer 
(“CCO”).  The department is staffed with compliance professionals stationed at company headq uarters 
and around the world.  The CCO reports to the Audit Committee of the 3M Board of Directors, which 
assists the Board in oversight of 3M’s legal and regulatory compliance efforts.  The Compliance and 
Business Conduct department oversees and administe rs strategic, systematic and operational 
components of 3M’s compliance program design and implementation.  The compliance program is 
based on the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  Its elements include:  
• education and training materials and a schedule upon which compliance training is conducted;  
• periodic evaluations, audits and measurements of the compliance program’s effectiveness;  
• a 24-hour helpline and website through which employees and others can report concerns 
and ask questions;  
• programs to conduct appropriate due diligence on business partners, potential and new acquisitions, and candidates for hiring and promotion;  
• investigative expertise; and,  
• incentives and discipline to address compliance successes  and failures.  
 
The Compliance and Business Conduct department collaborates with and is assisted by dedicated 
compliance organizations and subject matter experts in the areas of corporate audit, corporate security, 
trade compliance, government contracting, health care reg ulatory, environmental health and safety and 
other areas.  In addition, 3M utilizes a network of Compliance Contacts in every business unit and staff 
group who assist the Compliance and Business Conduct department in ensuring that their organizations continuously demonstrate legal compliance and ethical business conduct. Compliance Contacts assist in 
business conduct policy training, communications and completing periodic risk assessments for their 
organizations.  
 
Business Conduct Policies  
3M’s Business Con duct Policies are an important component of the company’s long tradition of 
compliance.  Our Business Conduct Policies apply to all employees of the parent company and all 
subsidiaries throughout the world.  They also apply to employees of joint ventures and other business 
affiliates in which 3M has a controlling interest.  These global policies apply to all locations and situations 
where 3M business is conducted and to all company -sponsored events.  Although 3M has business 
operations in more than 65 count ries, there is only one set of Business Conduct Policies, available in 
multiple languages.  The Policies help employees and others acting on 3M’s behalf take a consistent, 
global approach to key compliance issues.  3M employees, including supervisors, mana gers and other 
leaders are responsible for understanding the legal and policy requirements that apply to their jobs and for reporting any suspected violations of law or these policies.  
 
3M’s Anti -Bribery Policy requires compliance with all applicable anti- bribery laws, including the U.S. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and all applicable local laws where 3M operates.  This policy applies to 3M employees and to our bus iness partners who act on 3M’s behalf.  This policy, and 18 
 3M-provided training, are designed to educate our employees and business partners how to recognize 
the many forms in which bribes can appear and how to avoid them, even at the risk of losing business  
opportunities.  
 
Business Conduct Committee  
The 3M Business Conduct Committee is comprised of several senior executives and is chaired by 3M’s 
vice president for Compliance and Business Conduct.  The Committee has oversight for 3M’s various 
compliance efforts.  The Business Conduct Committee reports jointly to the Audit Committee of the 3M Board of Directors and to the Corporate Operating Committee.  
 
Compliance Training and Education  
3M offers a comprehensive online compliance training program which is available to all employees 
worldwide. In addition to an anti -bribery course, the program offers training in related areas such as 
business across borders, understanding the Foreign Corru pt Practices Act, financial reporting, 
government relationships, business conduct, and other key compliance areas.  More than twenty five 
courses are offered in multiple languages.  In addition, the 3M internal Legal Affairs website offers additional anti- bribery training on 3M’s global anti- bribery compliance program.  
 All courses are available for employees to take at any time.  However, 3M also requires certain 
employees to take specific courses on a periodic basis.  To accomplish this, each course has a 
predetermined mandatory population based on employee job grade, job function and country location.  Course completion is tracked electronically when an employee takes the course and passes a quiz.  
Executives and managers are accountable for creating and  promoting, by sound leadership and setting a 
good example, a workplace environment in which compliance and ethical business conduct are expected and encouraged.  
 
In addition to on -line training, the Compliance and Business Conduct department, in close collaboration 
with the Office of General Counsel, provides frequent, tailored in -person training to business, subsidiary 
and staff groups, as requested or deemed appropriate.  
 
Dedicated Reporting System  
A 24- hour confidential and anonymous helpline is available internally and externally through Ethics Point 
(an independent 3
rd party firm) to report any business conduct concerns (see 3M Business Conduct 
weblink below).  Reports made through this system are promptly investigated and responded to by the Complian ce and Business Conduct department or one of the other staff departments.  In addition, 3M’s 
Non-Retaliation Policy prohibits retaliation against anyone who raises a business conduct concern in 
good faith or cooperates in a company investigation .  
 
Maintaining Business Conduct Compliance  
Operating with uncompromising honesty and integrity is one of 3M’s core values and includes avoiding 
bribery or corruption in any form.  One hundred percent (100%) of 3M’s businesses perform a business 
conduct self assessment every other year which includes an assessment of risks related to corruption.  
Calibrated based on transaction, geography and other risk factors, all of our business partners are 
subjected to reputational due diligence reviews.  Depending on the outcome , this process may also 
include training, inclusion of relevant contractual terms, and other mitigating controls. 3M’s businesses 
and subsidiaries undergo an array of audits on a regular schedule.  In addition, the Compliance and 19 
 Business Conduct departmen t collaborates with the Legal Affairs department on pre-  and post -
acquisition due diligence efforts and on extensive compliance reviews of selected businesses, based on 
a variety of risk factors.  
 
By setting and implementing policies and conducting assess ments, 3M ensures that compliance and 
ethical business conduct compliance are maintained throughout the organization.

IDENTIFYING KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND ASSESSING SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING MATERIALITY   
This report and 3M’s sustainability web site are the company’s primary mechanisms to communicate 
sustainability information (principles, policies, programs, challenges & opportunities, performance) to 
stakeholders. Therefore, defining the scope and content  of the remaining information  provided in this  
report  is extremely import ant.  3M uses the following tools and mechanisms to help define our 
Sustainability Report’s  content:  
 
• Identification of 3M stakeholders and 3M key actions and engagement  
• Stakeholder r elevancy evaluation of information provided  
 3M’s sustainability key indicators materiality evaluation  
 Feedback from previous sustainability reports  
 Investor and customer interests  
 The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting guidelines  
 
3M participates and engages with numerous stakeholders regarding sustainability aspects and 
programs.  The following resources provide guidance to the corporate stakeholder engagement process: 
AccountAbility’s  AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard and “From Words to Action” The  
Stakeholder Engagement Manual Volume 2: The Practitioner’s Handbook on Stakeholder Engagement

We identify and evaluate sustainability aspects  and their associated key performance indicators  based on 
what is materially relevant and important  to 3M to achieve long -term sustainab le operations  [Note:  
Materiality for  the purposes of  sustainability reporting is not limited only to those sustainability topics that 
have significant financial impact on the organization as defined by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) for financial reporting] .  In addition, the relevancy of the same aspects  and key 
performance indicators are evaluated for  our identified  global stakeholders groups.  Materiality, as 
defined by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, includes topics and indicators that reflect the 
organization’s significant economic, environmental, and social impacts or would substantively influence 
the assessments and decisions of stakeholders.  DETERMINING SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING MATERIALITY AND STAKEHOLDER RELEVANCY  
 
Key global societal trends (e.g. resource scarcity, emerging economies, growing/aging populations, 
poverty, technology shifts, and e nvironmental Impacts) along with 3M strategies, processes, GRI 
Indicators, and additional industry recognized key performance indicators are factored and integrated in to 21 
 the analysis.  The principles of materiality as defined by the AA1000 Guidance on Materiality  and the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Materiality principles are applied  throughout 3M’ s evaluation process  and 
assist in prioritizing the level of materiality importance and  relevancy to our stakeholders of the 
recognized sustainability aspects : 
 
• Relevancy and importance to stakeholders (AA1000 -Stakeholder Behavior and Concerns)  
• Contributio n and connection  to corporate strategies and core values (GRI- Strategy)  
• Level of direct financial impact -long term and short term (AA1000 -Direct Financial Impact)  
• Relevancy of topic to industry section (AA1000 -Organizational Peer Based Norms)  
• Level of con nection to laws, regulations, international agreements with strategic significance to 
the organization or stakeholders (AA1000 Societal Norms)  
• Level of organization’s specialized knowledge to contribute to sustainability in focus area 
(AA1000- Related Performance)  
 
OUR MATERIALITY MATRIX  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
In 2011, this analysis was completed  internally using 3M su bject matter experts  with a range of 
perspectives and positions related to each of the identified sustainability aspects and key performance 
indicators.  Their input for stakeholder relevancy was based on subject matter  interactions with the 
appropriate identified stakeholder groups. This evaluation was not done directly with a cross -functional 
team representing all stakeholder groups.  3M continues to increase engagement with our stakeholders both internally and externally and integrating the outcomes of those interacti ons into our s ustainability 
strategy  and processes .  A review and update of  3M’s mat eriality  analysis will be completed 
approximately every 2 years . 
 
22 
 
An evaluation  scheme of (9) High, (3) Medium, (1) Low, (0) Not Applicable for both relevancy and 
materiality importance with associated factors was utilized.  Aspects and related performance indicators 
that showed high in relevancy/importance to stakeholders and /or highly material/important for 3M (from 
a sustainability success perspective)  using the above criteria were considered  as key elements  to include 
in the report.  
 
For examp le, aspects relating to innovation, sustainable products, diversified workforce, and  3M’s 
environmental footprint along with the respective associated key performance indicators are both highly important and relevant to 3M and our stakeholders , therefore a re addressed in this report.  
 3M also included aspects that are either high ly important/material to 3M’s sustainability success but may 
not be as highly relevant to all of our stakeholders (e.g. Occupational Safety and Health , human rights ) 
and also those that are highly relevant to stakeholders but not as material to 3M’s sustainability success as other aspects (e.g. Biodiversity).  
 Focusing and reporting on aspects that are most material to 3M’s sustainability success and also most  
relevant to our stakeho lders will enhance and advance  3M’s sustainability  performance and contribute to 
a more sustainable future.  This s ustainability success starts with having a Sustainability Vision and 
Strategy.  
3M’ S SUSTAINABILITY VISION  AND STRATEGY  
 
3M's commitment is to actively contribute to sustainable development through environmental protection, 
social responsibility and economic progress.  To us, that means meeting the needs of society today, 
while respecting the ability of future generat ions to meet their needs.  OUR SUSTAINABILITY VISION  
Strategic  Sustainability  Principles  
 In 2008, 3M launched a project to develop three strategic 
principles around sustainability.  3M's strategies for 
sustainability encompass the pursuit of customer satisfaction and commercial su ccess within a framework of 
environmental, social and economic values.  These principles were developed to provide 3M businesses and corporate staff 
groups with a flexible framework to engage our customers 
and key stakeholders around sustainability including help our customers address environmental challenges through 3M 
products and technologies.  
  
  
 23 
 • Economic Success
• :  Build lasting customer relationships by developing differentiated, practical 
and ingenious solutions to their sustainability challenges.  
Environmental Protection
• :  Provide practical and effective solutions and products to address 
environmental challenges for ourselves and our customers.  
Social Responsibility
 :  Engage key stakeholders in dialogue and take action to improve 3M’s 
sustainability performance.  
 
For more than 100 years, 3M has achieved consistent, profitable growth by creating innovative products, 
establishing strong relationships with customers and boosting operational efficiency.  At the same time, 
we've created a culture that promotes employee pride and well- being, fosters integrity and supports 
social and environmental responsibility.  Each year, 3M continues to move toward sustainability and strives to raise the bar on corporate e nvironmental, social and economic management. In order to ensure 
continuous improvement, we annually reevaluate and/or identify new key sustainability objectives for the 
company.  3M’ S KEY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  OBJECTIVES  
 These key issues are identified through 3M's management systems  (e.g. Enterprise Risk Management, 
EHS Management Systems, Human Resource Management, Life Cycle Management, Supply Chain 
Management, Manufacturing and Operations Management ) and input and feedback from our 
stakeholders.  A fe w of 3M's key objectives regarding sustainable development include:  
• Manage our environmental footprint.  
• Develop solutions that address environmental and social challenges for our customers and 
society.  
• Assure  our products are safe for their intended use and through out their entire life cycle.  
• Assure  the appropriate management of any 3M health and safety issues that may impact  
customers, neighbors and the public.  
• Maintain  a safe and healthy workplace.  
• Satisfy  our customers with superior quality and value.  
• Provide a supportive,  engaging, and flexible work environment.  
• Support  local needs and education in communities where 3M employees live and work.  
• Conduct our business with the uncompromising honesty and integrity.  
• Provide an attractive return for our investors.

 SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT APPROACH AND PERFORMANCE  
An innovative company cannot be built just on inanimate lab or mathematics alone.  It is built on a belief 
in the power of research and development, belief in our people and their work, and a deep conviction that the collective power of their imagination and creativity will generate future opportunity and financial 
betterment for the company .  ECONOMIC  SUCCESS  
 In 2011, the following growth strategies were set for the company and highlight  expanding  focus on 
relevancy to our customers, innovation opportunities, regional self sufficiency, diversity and operational 
excellence.  In 2012, great progress was made across the company on the growth strategies all while 
maintaining a high level of business conduct, integrity, and character . Some indicators of success includ e 
the following:  
• Alignment of the organization to become more relevant and responsible  to our customers  
• Commitment to increased funding in innovation  
• Driving growth through new capabilities in marketing, sales, and e- platforms  
• Strengthening operational excellence through focus on acquisition integration and Lean Six 
Sigma  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In 2012, 3M also set financial goals for the next five years with targets that are both realistic and  
aggressive.  The five- year goals are as follows:  
• Grow earnings per share 9 -11 percent per year, on average  
• Grow organic sales 4 -6 percent per year, on average  
• Maintain return on invested capital above 20 percent  
• Free cash flow conversion of 100 percent.

 Financial Performance  
• For further financial performance results, refer to 3M’s 2012 Annual Report  
 
ACCELERATING  INNOVATION  
3M has a long standing reputation as being a company committed to innovation and dedicating a large 
percentage of revenue to research and development  (R&D)  around the world.  In addition to having 
extensive resources at the headquarters in Minnesota, 3M has been rapidly expanding operations around 
the world and now operates approximately 8 0 laboratories and technology centers globally.  3M 
continues to invest in R&D to drive global growth of the company with emphasis being placed on organic growth.  The increased R&D spending is reflected in t he New Product Vitality Index (NPVI) which is 
currently at 3 3.1% and continue s to increase.  The NPVI is the percentage of net sales of products 
introduced within the last five years as compared to total net sales.  
 
 
Leveraging strategic partnerships with  several external entities enables 3M to integrate a rich diversity of 
thinking and open innovation into superior technologies, business assets, and innovative products.  The seven phase New Product Introduction process 3M uses provides  a robust framework for developing 
products from idea to launch.  Several other tools and systems are in place to promote, manage,  and 
evaluate the innovation process.  These include but are not limited to technical committees , tracking 
systems, and customer interaction mechanisms .

 DRIVING GROWTH THROUGH NEW PRODUCTS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ADVANTAGES   
In 2011, 3M established a new goal to “ Further Enhance the Environmental Sustainability Attributes  of 
New Products.”  Externally, the goal is aspirational and directional.  Internally, we have developed a 
process to measure our progress on this goal that involves evaluating all new products against a set of 
sustainable product criteria and measuring the sales of those products versus new products that do not meet the criteria.   
 To be counted internally as part of the goal, a new product m ust m eet a ll of t hese:  
• Not Pose any Significant Environmental Health & Safety Concerns that O utweigh the B enefit  
• Attribute Must be Relevant to Product Type & Market Place  
In other words, the attribute must be relevant to the product type, relevant  in the market it is primarily sold in the year when it is introduced (e.g. the attribute cannot  be integrated to comply 
with legislation / regulation in the primary market where the product is sold and at least 30% of the existing competitor products must not contain the same attribute)  
• Contain One or More of the 3M Defined Product Environmental Sustainability Attributes . 
Attributed include Products with Sustainable Attributes in  Raw Materials, in Manufacturing,  in 
Customer Use and Product Design/Function, and in Disposal.

ACHIEVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND QUALITY  PRODUCTS  
 
Getting Closer to our Customers   
Serving our c ustomer base locally, while still maintaining a global network is  one of our  global strategies 
to drive innovation, strengthen local resources/suppliers, and better serve our customers around the 
world. We believe by moving the research and development process closer to our global customers we 
will develop products that more specifically address  the needs of the respective global markets .  That is 
why 3M has been working to dev elop local research and development and technical centers, increase 
our use of  local suppliers and  build  manufacturing capacity closer  to customers .  
 
Responding to Customers  
3M has a variety of mechanisms to listen, gather, and importantly act on feedback from customers in the marketplace.  3M’s main customer contact center is staffed 24/7 with trained personnel to direct customer inquiries to the correct resources.  The direc tor of Corporate Quality and  Lean Six Sigma has 
overall responsibility for customer satisfaction.  In addition, independent quality managers, not reporting to the manufacturing organization, staff each division.  They review customer feedback with key 
stakeholder s and assure that all questions  are addressed in a professional, timely, and effective manner.  
  
 
 29 
  Quality Management Systems  and Products  
Quality today is more than product quality;  it is delivering a consistently superior total customer 
experience, in every transaction to every customer.  From the purchase of raw materials through 
manufacturing, packaging, marketing, wholesale and retail sales, inventory control, distribution, service, 
and support, invoicing, collection, warranty claims and more, there are many opportunities for 3M to drive customer focused quality improvement along the entire chain of activities.   
 
3M’s Corporate Quality Manage ment and Quality Network are le d by the Strategic Quality Leadership 
Team supported by the Quality Council.  The strategic quality leadership team sets strategy, identifies common opportunities for improvement, and directs global synergy across all business units within 3M.  Several tools are used to manage variation in all our business processes to ensure that 3M understands , 
meet s, and exceed s customer expectations .  The Quality Council includes all quality leaders from 
divisions, facilities, and countries where 3M has operations and is respo nsible  for ensuring the 
deployment of best practices and the implementation of the Quality Management System company -wide.  
  
An effective Quality Management System assures that 3M has processes in place to produce products and deliver services that consist ently meet customer requirements. As of year -end 2012, In the US, ISO 
registered  Quality  Management Systems (ISO 9001, ISO 13485, TS 16949, TL9000, and AS9100) include 
(80%) manufacturing sites, (70%) distribution centers, (58%) product design centers, and (100%) metrology labs.  Internationally, ISO registrations include (85%) manufacturing sites, distribution centers, 
and labs.  Note:  Some sites have multiple registrations but are accounted for once;  sites with multiple 
building/businesses were accounted for individually . 
 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL  STEWARDSHIP  
Environmental stewardship at 3M is based on the principle of providing practical and effective solutions and products to address environmental challenges for both ourselves and for our customers.  Setting and 
implementing global environmental policies, management systems, and tracking and maintaining key performance metrics enables 3M to continually integrate and drive  environmental stewardship 
throughout the organization.  
 
L
ONG HISTORY OF COMMITMENT  
3M has been  making continuous progress to ward reducing  the environmental impact of our products an d 
associated processes .  In 1975, 3M’s commitment to environmental stewardship was formalized when 
the Board of Directors adopted the 3M Environmental Policy.  This global policy, still in effect today, is believed to be the first policy providing a framew ork with measureable results from a major 
manufacturing company.  It is a comprehensive statement of 3M’s environmental commitment, 
emphasizing preventing pollution at the source.  The executive Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) 
Committee, reporting t o the Corporate Operating Committee provides oversight of 3M’s  environmental 
programs .  Environ mental stewardship is integrated into each of the six business units globally ensuring 
consistency and innovative environmental thinking.   As reflected  by our environmental performance 
indicators  and 2015 Sustainability Goals environmental stewardship is a core corporate commitment 
backed by decades of proven performance.  30 
  
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS  
3M has extensive global environmental management systems in place to identify, track, and manage 
relevant information indicative of corporat e-wide environmental performance.  These include 
management systems covering a full range of environmental compliance and performance metrics 
relevant to 3M operations, including the following critical elements  and further described below : 
• Environmental c ompliance management  
• Climate change management  
• Energy management  
• Air quality management  
• Waste management  
• Water management  
• Biodiversity management  
• Product l ife cycle management  
• Sustainable Packaging  
 
Information and performance data on a majority of these program elements is  tracked and reported on  
through corporate  electronic  reporting systems.  3M Environmental, Health, and Safety  scorecards 
published quarterly include environmental performance data at the facility, division, business unit, and corporate levels and are reviewed by executive management  for performance.  This enables  3M to 
monitor and identify successes, risks, and opportunities for improvements and reduction s worldwide.  
 
E
NVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE  MANAGEMENT  
3M operations are subject to global environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and 
hazardous wastes.  These laws and regulations are enforceable by national, state and local authorities 
around the world. 3M strives to be 100% compliant with all global environmental requirements and regulations . 
 3M‘s  multi -faceted strategy for impleme nting e nviro nmental management s ystems and g lobal auditing of 
environmental compliance for our operations is key to understanding  any potenti al gaps and gain 
resolution quickly .   All manufacturing facilities are required to complete a Global Environmental 
Management Self -Assessment at least annually, which consists of a detailed evaluation of each facility's 
systems for ensuring environmental compliance and management system performance.  In addition , 
approximately 66 % of 3M’s global manuf acturing sites (which represents approximately 90% of sales 
value of production)  have ISO 14001 certified (or  equivalent) management systems which  are reviewed 
by an independent  3rd party as required by that standard.  
 
Key elements of the environmental aud iting program  include : 
• To measure and assure that procedures, practices and programs comply with environmental 
regulations  
• To identify potential environmental concerns and establish plans to address them  
• To apprise management on compliance matters  
• To assur e 3M environmental policy and standard expectations are met  31 
  
 
Following are several key elements of auditing program:  
• Manufacturing, distribution and laboratory operations are audited for environmental compliance 
on a frequency determined based on relative risk  
• At least annually, all global operations are assessed against a variety of criteria to establish a prioritized list of facilities for compliance auditing  
• 3M uses a variety of tools and resources for compliance auditing, including:  
o Internally -developed compliance protocols, created by subject matter experts in 
regulatory programs and 3M processes  
o 3M's Global Environment al Management Self -Assessment as an evaluation tool  
reference  
o Externally -purchased compliance protocols, especially for intern ational operations, to 
ensure local compliance obligations are understood  
o Internal environmental compliance experts from around the company  
o External environmental consultants as needed to provide additional expertise and 3rd 
party verification of our audit ing protocols  
o Complete and robust documentation of audit findings, assignment of responsibility and 
due dates for closure of findings, and detailed review of findings closure to assure corrective actions are appropriate and sustainable.  
 
  
3M's environmental auditing program is audited periodically by 3M's Corporate Auditing department.  
 
Environmental Compliance Metrics : 
All global 3M owned facilities that are within 3M’s operational control are required to report 
environmental exceedences, spills, agency n otices, and fines through 3 M’s Worldwide Incident 
Management  System  (WIMS) .  These are defined as follows:  
 
• Exceedences
• :  Emissions or other environmental parameters above permitted or allowable 
regulatory levels  
Reportable Spills
• : Spills required to be reported to a regulatory agency or government 
organization  
Agency Notices
• : Notices  received by 3M for allegations  from an environmental regulatory or 
permitting requirement  
Fines
 : Compensation  paid  by 3M to discharge an administrative fine or penalty imposed by an 
environmental regulatory agency.  
The chart s below  provide environme ntal compliance metrics for 2009 -2012 in each of these four areas.  32 
  
 
 
 
 
The Worldwide Incident Management system  (WIMS)  was implemented in 2010 as the new corporate-
wide database for reporting all EHS incidents.  Several different systems were utilized in the past.  Continuous improvement related to increased awareness of responsibilities, understanding of the WIMS 
system,  and more consistent reporting requirements has provided an increase in accuracy of reporting by 
the 200+sites globally in 2011 and 2012.  
 3M had 124  releases to the environment (spills) that were reported to local government authorities in 
2012.  Of those releases, one was considered significant as defined by our internal EHS incident severity matrix (e.g. a spill that results in significant off -site impacts and requires extensive and/or long term 
remediation or monitoring).  The situation was stabilized and applicable mitigat ion and monitoring 
measures have been  implemented.

the result of fines incurred at one of our US manufacturing sites.  
 
CLIMATE CHANGE  
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions have been a priority for a long time at 3M. 3M has taken 
voluntary, responsible action to reduce and control GHG emissions.  In addition to managing direct emissions from 3M operations, 3M has a decades -long track record of improving energy efficiency at our 
facilities and offers a wide range of innovative products to help our customers improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon footprints (see Energy Efficiency s ection below).  
 The Corporate Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Committee is responsible for all final decisions on climate change strategy and GHG emissions.  This includes setting Corporate GHG emission reduction 
goals and policies.  For climate cha nge strategy and GHG emission advice the Corporate EHS committee 
has appointed the corporate Climate Change Steering Team.  Complementing the efforts of the Climate Change Steering Team, 3M’s business continuity planning process and crisis management progr am 
review and manage risks posed to the company’s physical operations and supply chains that may be affected, for example, by severe weather events and longer term trends.                
 
Guiding Principles  
 
3M’s approach to global climate change is based on several principles:  
• 3M supports the long -term goal of sustainable development; the company is committed to 
continuous and measurable improvement in environmental performance as a means of 
achieving that goal.  
• 3M believes that sufficient information exists to take voluntary, responsible action to reduce its greenhouse gas footprint.  
• 3M recognizes the activities of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and intends to participate in the ongoing dialog over strategies to address potential 
global climate chan ge issues.  
• 3M endorses a voluntary approach that involves all nations. If reductions are mandated by regulation or legislation, 3M endorses a uniform market -based approach that includes all 
nations; this approach should also include provisions for emissions trading, and credit for early action.  
• 3M supports continued research to assess the scientific and economic impacts of strategies to address climate change, while considering the interrelationship to other environmental 
regulations and issues.  
• 3M appli es its environmental goals and standards, including those  pertaining to greenhouse 
gas reductions, consistently around the world.  
 
 
 
 34 
 Management Commitments   
 
To address the issue of climate change, 3M has committed to:  
• Develop and maintain an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.  
• Continue to improve energy efficiency in manufacturing and administrative operations.  This 
includes all aspects of direct and indirect use of fossil fuels.  
• Manage emission of greenhouse gases to optimize reductions and cost be nefits.  
• Assess the potential use of renewable energy sources at 3M operations.  
• Increase the use of energy efficiency products within 3M operations and encourage their 
use by 3M suppliers and customers.  
• Incorporate an evaluation of environmental and ener gy impacts throughout the full product 
life cycle (from raw material acquisition through manufacturing, use, and disposal) as part of the company’s Life Cycle Management assessment process.  
• Invest in research and development to create new products and tec hnology that will reduce 
the generation and emissions of greenhouse gases.  
• Develop partnerships and participate in a positive dialog with governmental agencies and other organizations engaged in the climate change issue.  
 
 
History of Climate Change Reductions  
3M understands the impacts and reduction efforts associated with greenhouse emissions require long 
term commitment as the affects of both are not realized in one year alone.  Therefore, implementing 
reduction initiatives have been a key 3M corporate priority.  3M’s greenhouse gas management strategy includes a rigorous greenhouse gas accounting system to generate an annual inventory of worldwide 
emissions.  The process and associated GHG emissions reported from 1990 -2007 were validated by an 
external 3
rd party consultant.  Since 2002, the global 3M inventory has been developed, maintained and 
3rd party verified by 3M’s ISO/IEC 17025 accredited laboratory in accordance to the World Resource 
Institute (WRI)/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) GHG Protocol.  The data 
charts below reflect 200 9-2012 results.  
 The total GHG Invent ory encompasses the company’s diversity and complexity.  A total of approximately 
600 facilities including R&D, manufacturing, distribution centers, and administrative support offices within 3M’ operational control are accounted for in the current inventor y.  Both Scope 1(direct) and 
Scope 2 (indirect) emissions as categorized by WRI are included.  3M tracks and reports both absolute and indexed to net sales emission data.  
 
GHG emission data for 2012 cannot be directly compared to prior years (i.e. 1990 -2011) as the WRI-
based GHG accounting rules 3M has historically used needed to be modified  for 2012 to comply (and be 
consistent) with the requirements of the US EPA Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule (EPA GHG -
MRR).  In addition, use of the US EPA GHG -MRR resulted in the re- categorization of some chemical 
emissions from Non -Kyoto to Kyoto gas and vice versa, which resulted in a significant change to 3M's 
Kyoto / Non -Kyoto GHG emissions distribution as compared to the time period prior to 2012.   
Accordin gly, the 2012 inventory serves as a new baseline for future GHG reporting by 3M and other 
companies subject to the EPA GHG -MRR. 
 35 
 With the publishing of the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and 
Reporting Standard in October,  2011, 3M has been working on developing a Scope 3 emissions 
inventory. 3M places a high value on sound science and decision -making so that data reported is in 
accordance to the WRI/WBCSD Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.  All 
Upstream and Downstream Scope 3 categories were evaluated.  When available for a Scope 3 category, 
primary data was used to calculate the GHG emissions.  When primary data was not available or the complexity of the supply chain did not allow for direct  calculation, an input/output model calculation 
method was used.  The input/output model calculations were based on the level of sourcing financial spend for each GHG emission category and was conducted in collaboration with Climate Earth, Inc. for 
categories 1,  2, 5, and 7  (see Scope 3 table below) .  In 2013, a  third party audit of the input/output model 
data was conducted in accordance to the WRI/WBCSD Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) standard w hich 
determined  the quality of the data reported  and reliability of the calculation method for 2012  was in 
accordance to the standard.  Regarding category 11, Use of sold products, 3M has only started to 
estimate these emissions.  3M has a Climate Change Solutions product catalog with many products that reduce GHG emissions for our cust omers.  A p reliminary estimate on our three largest Climate Change 
Solutions product s indicate s a reduction of approximately 20 million metric tons CO2 eq in 2012 based 
on sales. Further work is being conducted on other Climate Change Solution s products as  well as 3M 
products that use energy.

Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goals  
3M has demonstrated leadership in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions through setting and 
achieving GHG reduction goals.  3M has established and met two rounds of reduction goals.  The first set 
of goals was established in 2002, a U.S. goal, that was set as part of our participation in the U.S. EPA’s Climate Leaders program, to reduce absolute U.S. GHG emissions by 30% reduction from 20 02 - 2007, 
and a stretch goal to reduce our absolute 1990 global GHG emissi ons 50% by 2005.  We achieved our 
U.S. goal by reducing GHGs by 53% from 2002- 2007.  We achieved our stretch 50% reduction goal in 
2006 when we reduced our global GHGs by 53% from a 1990 baseline (we just missed the global 50% reduction in 2005 by a few percentage points).  
 
Our next GHG goal was established in 2007.  It called for a 5% reduction in GHGs, indexed to sales, by 
2011 from a 2006 base.  Final results for this goal were determined in May 2012.  We achieved a 55% in  
GHG reduction s, indexed to sales, from 2006 through 2011.  Our reduction far exceeded our goal due to 
innovative new products and processes, strong growth in global sales, effective emissions control technology, and strong employee energy efficiency efforts.  T hrough 2011, we have reduce d our 
absolute global GHGs by 72 % from a 1990 baseline.  
 
3M is currently working to establish its next GHG reduction goal(s). We plan to establish a new goal in 
2013.  The following considerations are part of our current GHG goal setting effort:   
• How to best align our new goal with 3M’s sustainability principles and strategy;  
• Relative materiality and impact by 3M on global GHG emissions throughout its supply chain;  
• Possible new goal structures; and  
• 3M system changes that may be required.

Product Carbon Footprint Evaluations  
3M conducts product carbon footprint evaluations as part of the product Life Cycle Assessment process 
on select products, and is engaged with key stakeholders to improve and refine common metrics for 
such analysis.  3M defines a product carbon footprint as  greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) emissions 
resulting from a product across its entire life cycle -- including raw material acquisition, manufacturing, 
transport, storage, use, and disposal of the product.  To calculate carbon footprints, 3M applies current ly 
available standards and tools (e.g., WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard).  One of the challenges in this area is the wide range of potential approaches and 
assumptions being utilized for such calculations.   To address these issues, 3M supports further 
development of common metrics and is working with the World Resource Institute and World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD), peer companies, governments, and environmental 
organizations.  The goal of these efforts is to enable 3M and others to provide cost -effective, accurate 
and useful information to customers and other stakeholders.  
 
Managing Carbon Offsets  
Using product carbon footprint information, 3M has offset greenhouse gas emission s from certain 
products through the purchase of carbon offsets.  To consistently manage carbon offsets, 3M adopted a 
Product Carbon Footprint Offsets Standard (available at www.3M.com/ sustainability) .  This standard 
addresses the requirements for the calcu lation of product carbon footprints and the management of 
product carbon offsets. This standard also establishes criteria for the carbon footprint methodologies 
applied and acceptable qualified offsets, such as Voluntary Carbon Standard offsets (VCSs) from  Certified 
Emission Reductions (CERs) and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) from Verified Emission Reductions 
(VERs).  
 
Through December 2012 , 3M businesses have acquired carbon offsets for product greenhouse gas 
emissions from seven dif ferent product lines across five business market sectors.  For these efforts, 3M 
Japan received the Encouraging Prize of the Carbon Offset Award from CO -Net in Japan in 2012.  
 40 
  
Regulatory Impacts  
Emission reporting obligations in the United States and emission control require ments under the 
European Union emission trading scheme apply to 3M operations in these jurisdictions.  
  
Currently, two 3M facilities (France and Belgium) are required to hold emission allow ances under the 
European Union Emission Trading S cheme.  At both facilities, for all compliance periods to date, actual 
greenhouse gas emissions have remained below the emission credit allocations awarded by the 
applicable regulatory agencies.  In 2011, 3M facilities in the United States began reporting greenhou se 
gas emissions under the U .S. EPA Greenhouse Gas  Mandatory  Reporting Rule.   Our large US facilities 
continue to calculate and report greenhouse gas emissions annually.  There are also a few states that 
have additional greenhouse gas reporting requirement s that have impacted our facilities in those states .  
 
Physical Risks  
Severe weather and long term trends could affect 3M’s operations and supply chain.  To address these 
and other risks, 3M has developed and maintains a systematic Business Continuity and Planning Process 
and Crisis Management Program.  To implement this process and respond to specific incidents, 3M’s 
Corporate Crisis Management coordinates  efforts of  local crisis management teams maintained at each 
3M facility and international subsidiary.   Corporate and local plans take into account natural disaster, infectious disease, employee safety, 
protection of assets, customer service and other bus iness continuity requirements that may impact 
specific facilities and businesses.  Every year, the local crisis management team must review and update their plan to reflect current conditions and performs a tabletop or actual crisis response exercise.  3M 
Corporate Auditing and Corporate Security monitor facility compliance with the Corporate Crisis Management Program.  
 3M mitigates supply chain risks through a variety of management practices, including multi- sourcing 
raw materials, pre- qualification of potential outsource manufacturers, maintaining appropriate stocks of 
raw materials and contingency plans with key suppliers to ensure allocation to 3M in the event of supply disruption.

NERGY EFFICIENCY  
At 3M, energy management  is global, comprehensive, and extends beyond energy efficiency efforts in 
factories and buildings.  It is a team effort guided by the global Corporate Energy Policy.   Energy 
management responsibilities are coordinated by the Corporate Energy Management team, with oversight 
by 3M’s  corpora te energy manager and senior engineering  vice president, with active support from the 
CEO.  The team invo lves personnel from environmental  operations , facility operations, finance, sourcing, 41 
 engineering, energy management and corporate marketing an d public affairs.  Each department provides 
cross functional contributions; ensuring energy efficient technology is being used, opportunities are 
being identified in the design process, renewable energy opportunities are identified and financed, and 
data is tracked routinely and consistently by facilities.  
 
Setting Energy Performance Goals  and Evaluating P rogress  
In 2010, a s part of our 2015 Sustainability Goals,  3M set a global goal to increase energy efficiency 
(resulting in decreased  greenhouse gas emission s) by 25% in 2015 from a 2005 base year (as measured 
by worldwide energy use indexed to net sales).  
 3M collects and analyzes energy -use data and energy efficiency project metrics to: track progress 
toward corporate energy and green house gas goals; identify opportunities for improvement, benchmark 
against past performance, and identify best practices that can be applied across global operation s.  All 
manufacturing locations and other locations greater than 30,000 square feet  report e nergy use and 
energy cost s into an electronic reporting system monthly .  Data is analyzed at the facility, division, 
business unit, and corporate levels quarterly for 3M’s six major business units (210 locations in 42 
countries) as part of 3M’s EHS Managem ent System Scorecard previously described.   
 
Total Energy Use (2000- 2012) : 
3M’s commitment to improving energy efficiency is evident in the figures an d goals summary below.  
From 2000 through 2012 , 3M has reduced energy usage by 49 % indexed to Net Sales.   Having exceeded 
its energy reduction goal ahead of schedule, 3M set an internal target to improve energy use per unit of 
product an additional 15% (2010 -2015).  Achieving these goals would help prevent 1.3 million metric 
tons of related CO2 emissions.

AIR QUALITY  MANAGEMENT   
An important component to 3M ’s sustainability strategy is our commitment  to improving air q uality 
globally .  Air emissions from 3M operations include volatile organics, particulates, and substances listed 
on the US EPA Toxic Release Inventory or global equivalent.   
 
With the increasing complexity of air quality regulations globally, reductions in actual air emissions  and a 
solid air permit/regulatory approach are increasingly important components to global business growth  
and long term sustainability .  Air emission reductions are achieved through a varie ty of methods at 3M 
and include, but are not limited to increasin g the use of more sustainable raw mat erials, water based 
coatings  improving  process/equipment efficiency upgrading equipment , and implementing and 
maintaining pollution control technologies .  All reduction efforts are integral to the company’s overall 
success and assist the company with the challenge of improving air quality in the areas in which we 
operate.  
 
Implementing and Maintaining Pollution Control  
Although 3M has made significant progress in reducing air emissions from our operations through  
pollution prevention thinking  (elimination at the source)  and improving process efficiencies (e.g. Lean Six 
Sigma), 3M implements and maintains pollution control equipment when necessary.  A variety of 
pollution control technologies are evaluated and utilized to control and reduce our air emissions.  These 
include thermal oxidizers, baghouses, scrubbers, and c yclones.  3M maintains rigorous preventative 
maintenance schedules to ensure proper operation and ongoing air pollution control effectiveness of volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ), particulate matter , and other air emissions .    
 
In the future, 3M is looking to expand the use of alternative control technologies to reduce energy and 
natural resource usage of pollution control equipment , while still provi ding required air pollution control 
efficiencies.  Biological air pollution control systems are an innovative solution to control VOC emission s 
in certain 3M process es. In pilot and select  full scale d installations, 3M has demonstrated the technology 
can adequately reduce VOC emissions while significantly reducing operating costs, greenhouse gas 
emissions, and eliminating natural gas usage.   
 
 45 
 Integrating Green Chemistry Initiatives  
 
To integrate more sustainable raw materials, select 3M divisions use the  12 P rinciples of Green 
Chemistry ( developed by Paul Anastas, with the U.S. EPA and John Warner  currently President  of Warner 
Babcock Institute for Green Chemistry ), a holistic set of principles and framework for putting green 
chemistry into practice, as a tool for product development in select divisions . Green chemistry is the 
design, development, and implementation of chemical products and processes to reduce or eliminate the 
use and generation of substances hazardous to hu man health and the environment .  They must be more 
environmentally benign, more economical, and better performing.    
 The principles can generally be grouped into four main categories:  Hazard Reduction, Lower Impact 
Products & Processes, Resource Reduction & Conservation, and Use of Renewable Raw Materials.  
 
In 2010, 3M’s Material Resource Division  (MRD) , a major  internal supplier for many materials within 3M 
created a new product design tool which mandates the evaluation of new chemistries/products against the 12 principles in their divi sion.  These principles are as follows : 
 
1. Prevent Waste Generation  
2. Atom Economy  
3. Less Hazardous Chemical Syntheses  
4. Designing Safer Chemicals  
5. Safer Solvents and Auxiliaries  
6. Design for Energy Efficiency  
7. Use of Renewable Feed  stocks  8. Use of most direct  synthetic route  
9. Catalysis  
10. Design for Degradation  
11. Real- time analysis for Pollution 
Prevention  
12. Inherently safer chemistry for Accident Prevention  
 The Material Resource Division  engages  researchers and manufacturers at every stage of development  
to meet or exceed 3M's 2015 Sustainability Goals waste reduction targets.  Green Chemistry is now a formal part of all scale- up efforts, most notably in an assessment of new programs as they move through 
research to full scale production.  These assessmen ts are documented to enable rapid implementation 
and broad application of Green Chemistry advancements, regardless of their origin.  T hese efforts enable 
MRD to effectively introduce alternative sustainable options aligned with increasing  regulatory trends and 
to minimize costs as petroleum prices continue to rise, giving 3M a considerable advantage in raw materials pricing.    
 
Broadening Focus in 2012- 13 
In 2011, 3M established a green chemistry network to expand these activities outside of the MRD.  This network became a formal 3M Tech Forum (Collaboration Network of 40+ technology focused chapters and approximately  11,000 employees) chapter in 2012 and is now called the Green Chemistry  and 
Sustainable Products Tech Forum chapter.  The ne twork provides a forum for 3M employees to 
communicate green chemistry ideas and  practices across all 3M businesses and functional groups to 
help drive business growth.  Through internal events  and collaboration  mechanisms, objectives of the 
network are to promote less hazardous materials, design products and processes with lower impacts, consider renewable raw material selections, and conserve and reduce resources for 3M and our 
customers.  The chapter’s members come from 3M's research and  development, product responsibility, 
sustainability, and marketing communities.

Setting V OC Goals and Evaluating Progress  
 
Air emiss ions from 3M operations ( e.g. volatile organics, particulates, and substances listed on the US 
EPA Toxic Release Inventory or global equivalent ) are tracked, reported, and aggregated through 
corporate environmental data management systems.  Reductions in corporate- wide air emissions have 
been accomplished through the development of solvent -less and lower particulate technologies, green 
chemistry initiatives, pollution prevention programs, and pollution  control equipment all mentioned 
above.   
 
Due to the nature and extent of 3M operations, volatile organic contaminant (VOC) emissions are used as  
an indicator air pollutant to track progress toward air emission reductions.  3M has had VOC reduction 
goals s ince 1990 as shown in the table below. Using 1990 as a base year, 3M has reduced VO C 
emissions 98% by year -end 2012 indexed to net sales.  Specific goal period achievements are 
highlighted below.  Manufacturing sites account for a majority of 3M's Environmental Footprint (96% of 
Sales Value of  Production (SVOP ). Manufacturing facilities under 10,000 lbs, Research and Development 
sites, Distribution Centers, Sales Offices, and other locations are considered de minimus  due to the 
limited use of solvents at these sites/locations .  3M's VOC data below  includes 3M manufacturing 
operations with total output greater than 4536 metric tons per year (10,000 pounds).

Waste management and minimization is an important component of 3M’s environmental stewardship .  
The 3M Corporate Reverse Supply Chain Services organization provides corporate oversight for global 
waste management activities.  3M’s Waste Management standard applies to all locations and provides 
the framework and corporate expectations that are required to manage all waste types from the t ime of 
generation until reused,  recycled, treated or disposed.  The standard sets a baseline for several core 
waste program elements and encourages waste minimization and recycling whenever possible.  
 
Recycling, Reuse, Treatment and Disposal  
All waste recycling, reuse, treatment, and disposal practices are required to comp ly with applicable 
regulations and the 3M Disposal of Chemical Waste Policy , including waste stream profiles, content 
identification, and labeling .  Waste management practices and technologies are required to be approved 
through the 3M Corporate Reverse Supply Chain Services organization wh ere the emphasis is on using 
only the most environmentally safe and appropriate waste management practices available.   0.18 0.19 0.20 0.21 0.22 0.23 2012 2011 2010 2009

3M Corporate Reverse Supply Chain Services has a team of subject matter experts (Resource Recovery) 
dedicated to initiating and supporting internal projects to identify materials for  recycling.  This team 
works with many levels within the organization  (e.g. facilities , divisions, businesses and corporate wide)  
on a variety of diff erent waste recycling and reuse initiatives .  The va riation of projects and programs 
range from basic office recycling to more complex such as developing and capturing intrinsic waste 
materials generated off a manufacturing line.  Through an evaluation process  all aspects of diversion 
benefits or risk are r eviewed .  Some programs have in itiated and implemented excellent reuse programs, 
which are then shared as a best practice throughout the organization for replication.  3M continues to 
work with our customers and manufacturing partners to manage or develop recycling programs to 
continue to supp ort our community commitment to sustainability.  
 
Ensuring Waste Compliance  
The 3M Waste Management Standard requires each location to assign a Waste Management Coordinator who is responsible for ensuring personnel rece ive applicable waste training.   Corporate Reverse Supply 
Chain services administers the waste training for  the coordinators in the US and is currently enhancing  
and expanding waste training internationally.  Compliance with all 3M and other regulated waste 
requirements is evaluated through the environmental auditing program.  
 
  
 
Setting Waste Goals and Evaluating Progress  
3M has been setting total waste reduction goals since 1990.  Using 1990 as a base year, 3M h as 
reduced our total waste by 68 % through 2012.  Specific goal period achievements are highlighted below.   
Manufacturing sites account for a majority of 3M's Environmental Footprint (96% of Sales Value of  
Production (SVOP).  3M estimates an additional 7% of waste generated from non -manufacturing s ites, 
including laboratories, distribution centers, and office facilities.   3M's waste data below includes 3M 
manufacturing operations with total output greater than 4536 metric tons per year (10,000 pounds).

WATER MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION  
 
Understanding our  Water Footprint  
Reducing w ater use and improving water quality are additional important elements of environmental 
stewardship .  Therefore, 3M continues to actively  understand,  manage, and work toward reducing our 
corporate water footprint.  3M’s Water Management Standard provides a global framework including  
both general and specific elements for water management within the company.  The standard requires 
3M operations to manage their water resources through understanding their water use, compliance with regulatory requirements, systematic conservation and reuse, and reporting of water usage .  Water 
resources include water intake, effluent water discharge, and rainwater.  
 
Setting Water Pe rformance Goals and Evaluating P rogress  
3M’s Corporate Operating C ommittee endorsed a water conservation goal as p art of the 2015 
Sustainability G oals.  The goal is focused on water conservation planning and reductions efforts in 
regions of the world where water resources are limited or excessively extracted  (water stressed and 
hyperstressed ).  3M uses the definitions and tools established by the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to compare the company's various site locations and their affiliated water use with validated WBCSD water  availability , population , and biodivers ity information on a country 
and watershed basis.   Currently 3M has identified 24 sites located in water stressed or hyper stressed 
areas  as defined by the Mean Annual Relative Water Stress Index (WBCSD -Global Water Tool)  and that 
have potential Medium to High  local water risks,  and use water for sanitary and process operations that  
is equal to or greater than 1000 cubic meters  annually .  Each 3M site located in a water stressed or 
hyper stressed area is required  to understand their water use in detail, associated business 
risks/impacts, and local water requirements .  Each identified site is also required to develop a water 51 
 conservation plan outlining current and future water conservation efforts.   Annual evaluations  are 
conducted using any updates from the WBCSD Global Water Tool, an analysis of site operations and 
water usage, and local conditions to determine 3M sites water stress level.  
 Manufacturing sites account for a majority of 3M's Environmental Footprint (9 6% of Sales Value of 
Production (SVOP).  3M estimates an additional 4% of water use from non -manufacturing sites, including 
laboratories, distribution centers, and office facilities. T he water data provided below includes 
manufacturing site s that produce m ore than 4,536 metric tons (10,000 pounds) of product.   
 Although 3M does not have a quantitative goal yet, conservation efforts indicate a 37.1% decrease in 
water use globally  indexed to net sales from 2005 to 201 2.  Water c onservation efforts have been 
achieved through recycling/reuse and improvements to our buildings and manufacturing processes.  A majority of our water int ense manufacturing operations are located in the United States and Europe in 
areas not water stressed or water scarce.  H owever , they  also contribute significantly to our conservation

ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY  
Enhancing and preserving biodiversity is an important part of 3M’s value of respecting our social and 
physical environment. 3M has been working to preserve biodiversity both on our property and through 
our support of organizations like The Nature Conservan cy. 
 
Biodiversity at 3M  
The locations of some of 3M’s facilities share the same land with rare species of wildlife. In these 
locations and on other 3M properties that support wildlife, the company works to enhance and protect 
the area’s natural habitat.  
 
When developing property, the planning process begins with a thorough evaluation of local soils and 
geologic conditions, ground water and hydrology characteristics, drainage, flora and  fauna and items of 
archeological or historical significance.  The resulting design seeks to comply with all known local, state 
or federal regulations and to avoid or minimize negative impacts on cultural or natural resources.  If an 
impact is unavoidable, we seek to mitigate the impact by preserving a property with property of equal or 
greater quality.  
 
3M has a very large, existing property portfolio, much of which was designed and built nearly 40 years 
ago.  As our business and customer needs change, we have focused on maximizing the efficient use of existing space and to t he extent possible renovating to meet our current and future business needs.  This 
allows the company to grow while minimizing our impacts on biodiversity and our natural reso urces.  
 
For example, one of 3M’s  facilities in Austin, Texas is located within cr itical habitat for the endangered 
golden -cheeked warbler.  The 3M Austin facility has worked hard to not only limit the impact of its 
operations on the warbler, but to enhance the facility’s property to create a habitat that can be used by 
the warbler as well as a number of other species found near the facility.  
 
The 3M Austin  site worked with The Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) , a nonprofit organization that helps 
corporations, conservation organizations and individuals interested in protecting and enhan cing wildlife 
habitat.  WHC  makes recommendations in the form of a detailed wildlife plan for the property that will 
allow wildlife to prosper. After programs are put in place, the WHC  operates a Corporate Habitat 
Certification/International Accreditation Pr ogram. This program recognizes exceptional habitat 54 
 management and environmental education programs at corporate sites.   Sites are required to re- certify 
each year.  
 
In addition  to the 3M Austin site, c urrently, two other 3M facilities maintain Wildlife Hab itat C ertification : 
Menomonie, Wisconsin and Cottage Grove, Minnesota.  
 
Biodiversity through Partnerships  
The Nature  Conservancy ( TNC):
   
Through the 3M Foundation,  3M has worked with 
the Nature Conservancy to preserve habitat 
around the world.  This partnership is helping to 
safeguard critical habitat and preserve 
biodiversity.  The partnership with TNC involves  
3M employees and local residents.  In addition to 
increasing the amount of protected lands for 
migration zones, endangered wildlife and rare 
indigenous plants, 3M is working with the Nature 
Conservancy to improve visitor access and learning opportunities for the public.  
 Each year, 3M works with the Nature 
Conservancy on a variety of projects worldwide:  
 
• Canada Dark woods  in British Columbia  
North America Region  
3M supported the preservation of land in Darkwoods .  Darkwood’s  255,000 acres of contiguous 
protected area links existing wildlife management areas with parks where threatened plant and 
animal species may thrive.  Through the Nature Conservancy’s efforts, h abitat is being restored 
for caribou , grizzly bears, and owls  while protecting water quality and forest lands.   
• United States  - Montana Forest Legacy and North Fork of the Flathead  
Sustaining the Crown of the Continent and connecting the vast network of wild lands in the Northern Rockies presents one of the best opportunities on the globe for ecosystem protection 
and resiliency.  In 2011, 3M provided a $1 million grant for the Crown of the Continent project  
representing  two of the largest conservation acquisitions in North American history and knitting  
together a 60 -million-acre network of protected public lands across Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, 
and into southern British Columbia.   
  
  
 
 
 
 
 “Over the past decade and beyond, 3M has been 
a critical partner in our organization’s evolution, 
helping to advance  our work in places across the 
world – from the indigenous lands of Australia’s 
outback, Mexico’s Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, 
and the Maya Forest; to Brazil, where we train 
Amazon indigenous leaders to conserve their 
vast territories; to China’s wetland reserves; to 
British Columbia’s Darkwoods and Alabama’s 
Paint Rock River watershed; and numerous 
points in between. . . We could not have 
achieved our goals and successes without the 
collaboration of 3M and the 3M Foundation.”  
Mark Tercek, President and CEO, The Nature 
Conservancy  55 
 
• The Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve  Asia Pacific and Northern China Regions  
The nature reserve is near the mouth of the Yangtze River 
near Shanghai.  It is an important corridor unique 
biodiversity for migratory birds from Japan to Australia 
and a critical fish spawning area.  With 3M support  
through funding and over 80 volunteers , TNC is helping to 
develop conservation management plans, including 
ecotourism to help  ensure that environmental safeguards are in place to protect the area.  The 
State Forestry Administration of China has asked TNC to help direct their efforts to create a 
system of 51 model Nature Reserves in China by 2020.  These reserves will serve as 
demonstration sites for the government to promote effective conservation management and the 
integration of community and economic development with conservation efforts.  
 
• Australia’s Fish River Station  
The 3M Foundation is helping The Nature Conservancy take on conservation priorities by 
supporting The Nature Conservancy’s purchase of the 457,000 -acre Fish River Station in 2010 
and has since begun working with Indigenous Ran gers and other partners to remove more than 
2,500 feral animals from the property, reduce wildfires, and abate more than 40,000 tons of potential greenhouse gas emissions.  The Fish River fire program serves as a model for other 
Indigenous -run conservation  programs across northern Australia.  
 
• The 3M Foundation and The Nature Conservancy are also helping to launch a new program that will enable indigenous people in Australia to earn carbon credits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions on their land.  Once ear ned, the community can then sell those credits to people and 
businesses wishing to offset their emissions.  The carbon credits will finance ongoing 
conservation work on their lands —helping to simultaneously stop deadly wildfires, reduce 
greenhouse gas emis sions, and prov ide jobs for indigenous people.  
 
• In the Brazilian Amazon , indigenous territories occupy 22 percent of the Amazon and many of its 
best-preserved areas, but it suffers from illegal encroachment from loggers.  This year, Brazil 
adopted its National Indigenous Territories Environmental Management Policy to strengthen 
indigenous peoples’ control of their lands and direct millions of dollars to needed sustainable 
development and conservation projects.  3M provided a $500,000 gift to The Nature Conservancy 
to support implementation of the Indigenous Territories Environmental Management Policy, 
which will help to address indigenous peoples’ rights, as well as protect pristine habitat in the 
Brazilian Amazon, setting a  sustainable development pathway for the future.  Latin America Region  
 
• Brazil- Atlantic Forest Water Producer Program  
In Brazil, a 3M grant is helping TNC preserve the concentration of unique and threatened plants and animals that can only be found in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest. Less than 8 percent of the original tropical forest remains today.  The purchase of nearly 2,400 acres will manage and protect it 
from further clearing and environmental threats.  
 56 
 The Atlantic Forest provides drinking water to 70% of Brazil’s 120 million p eople. TNC is working 
on a large- scale reforestation and protection program in the Atlantic Forest where one of its most 
important project sites provides water to nearly 9 million people in Sao Paolo.  3M’s plant in 
Campinas has been supporting national - and municipal -level reforestation projects in the area 
since 2004.   
 
• Mexico- Calakmul Biosphere Reserve and Maya Forest  
The forests of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula are of extraordinary ecological importance.  More than 
1.5 million acres of forest have been set aside – with assistance from 3M and other donors in 
protected areas such as the Calakmul Biosphere reserve. Still, important forest lands are lost or threatened by illegal logging, conversion to agriculture, settlement, and unsustainable tourism.  
 TNC’s goal for the region is to protect the forest while developing livelihoods for local people 
through sustainable forestry and tourism activities.  
 
Project strategies:  
o Protect an additional 250,000 acres of forest by acquiring land, decreeing protected areas,  and working with private and community landowners  
o Develop sustainable forestry practices on 100,000 acres of private and community -
owned forest lands  
o Promote and develop community -based, sustainable tourism  
o Reforest up to 10,000 acres of forest lands dama ged by Hurricane Dean  
Effectively manage forest protected areas by implementing wildfire controls, reducing  
illegal logging and deterring p oachers

RODUCT RESPONSIBILITY  
Our commitment to p roduct responsibility includes product regulatory compliance, life cycle 
management, and accurately representing our products through communications and marketing.  
 
Life Cycle Management  
3M’s global Life Cycle Management (LCM) process is used to identify opportunities associated with 
environmental, health, and safety (EHS) performance, and to characterize and manage EHS risks  and 
regulatory compliance throughout a product’s life cycle ( raw material acquisition, development, 
manufacture, use, and disposal).  LCM is qualitative in evaluation  and applies globally to all 3 M products 
and internal transfers regardless of their source.  All 3M products -  whether 3M- developed, developed 
jointly with another company, or ac quired from a third party may be subject to review.  Any product 
purchased from an outside supplier for sale as a 3M product receives the same product life cycle 
consideration as an internally developed and manufactured product. LCM evaluations are a required 
component of a 3M’s New Product Introduction (NPI) process.    
 All of the elements listed below may be incorporated and implemented through various tools and 
resources in 3M’s overall LCM evaluation process.  
• Environmental Impacts of Product use  
• Environmental Impact s of Product Manufacturing  57 
 • Environmental Impact s of Raw Materials/Procured Components  
• Climate Change Impacts  
• Reduction of Hazardous Materials  
• Reduction of Health Effects  
• Design for Recycling of Remaining Materials  
 
A more detailed, quantitative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)  is complet ed on selected products and 
analyz es the environmental impacts of m aterial acquisition, manufacturing, and distribution.  Individual 
LCAs may be conducted on specific life cycle stages to evaluate risk in more detail during the new product introduction process as needed.  3M has global strategy for conducting  consistent  LCAs, lead by 
the Corporate Environm ental Laboratory, which has adopted the ISO 14040 series standards, World 
Resource Institute, and World Business Council for Sustainable Development standards as guidance.  
 
 
Environmental Product Declarations  
Environmenta l Product Declarations (EPDs)  standardize  reports to communicate Life Cycle Assessment 
(LCA) results. Product Category Rules (PRCs) are developed to standardize application of a  Product 
Carbon Footprint or LCA standard to a specific product category.  3M uses EPDs as one tool to 
communicate aspects of our products that are environmentally beneficial to the user/consumer.  3M has 
adopted the ISO 14040 series standards, World Resource Institute, World Business Council for Sustainable Development standards  and the ReCiPe methodology  for creating Environmental Product 
Declarations.  In addition, oth er standards as well as published category rules may apply and are utilized 
upon request . 
 
Environmental Product Declarations are generat ed using Product Category  Rules  (PCRs) .  3M uses 
published Product Category Rules that have been established and are credible where appropriate for the use in making  Environmental Product Declarations.  3M is working with the Sustainability Consortium to 
assist in establishing Product Category Rules.  Internal guidance is provided to 3M businesses g lobally to 
ensure the EPDs meet  the company's requirements and are substantiated in accordance to the standards 
and methodologies specified.  
 
Product Marketing and Communications  
It is 3 M policy  (
3M’s Advertising and Product Representation Policy ) to represent our products trut hfully, 
fairly and accurately  in all sales, advertising, packaging and promotional efforts.  Management of every 
3M business unit is res ponsible for ensuring  appropriate review  of advertising and claims regarding 
respective business products and services.  
 
All Environmental Product claims must be substantiated and technically accurate to th e end user as 
specified by the Advertising and Product Representation Policy .  3M’s environmental claims support t eam 
assists businesses in determining the appropriate product claims and is compris ed of laboratory 
scientists, legal staff, life cycle management professionals, and other environmental marketing and business expertise.  Extensive environmental marketing claim information and guidance is provided in 
3M’s internal Environmental Claims Guide.  
  
 58 
 Providing Sustainable Products  
3M’s commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship  goes beyond minimizing our impacts 
to the environment from our operations.  Through innovation and as noted through examples highlighted 
above, 3M provides product solutions that help our customers minimize their own environmental impacts 
and make people's lives easier and better.  Our inspiration comes from listening to customers and creating new products and solutions for the challenges and opportunities they face.  As mentioned, 3M 
has developed env ironmental solution catalogs that  feature these products (see link in further 
information  below ).  Products included in the catalogs must meet one or more of the criteria below:  
 
Products that help 3M  customers to reduce their environmental footprint  
• Products that reduce air pollution   
• Products t hat reduce customer energy use and /or greenhouse gas emissions    
• Products that reduce customer waste (e.g. reuse,  recycling, and composting )  
• Products that red uce customer water use or pollution    
• Products that prevent the disturbance of environmentally sensitive areas or clean up industrial 
pollution  
• Improve fuel economy in vehicles (e.g. light weighting)  
 
Products that are manufactured with a reduced footprint   
• Products manufactured using a low/no solvent (VOC) process    
• Products that are made with recycled content, renewable resources, or using 3rd party certified materials  
• Products that do not contain materials of concern typically found in competitive produ cts 
Products with less of a carbon footprint than other similar solutions using the same methodology  
S
USTAINABLE PACKAGING  
Providing sustainable packaging solutions  for 3M produ cts and processes is an important component to 
our overall sustainable success.  
 
3M’s  global sustainable packaging vision  and strategy are aligned well with 3M’s Sustain ability 
Principles and  Strategies .  Our vision is that 100% of 3M’s packaging is environmentally sensible, 
responsibly sourced , preferred by our internal and external customers while providing added value and 
an economic advantage for 3M.  
 For 3M this means strategically working together worldwide in multiple aspects of packaging from  
design to distribution and use:
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 59 
 Environmental Stewardship  Social Responsi bility  Economic Success  
• Research, develop, 
validate, and share 
innovative sustainable 
material solutions  
 • Provide continued leadership in sustainable packaging 
solutions and 
communications  
 • Provide  innovative, practical, sustainable 
packaging solutions  
 
• Responsibly design and

sensible solutions  
 
• Continuously improve , 
and educate internally 
and ex ternal partners  
 • Ensure 3M and supplier 
packaging compliance  
 • Maintain performance, safety and regulatory 
compliance  
 
 
3M focuses on the “R’s” of sustainable packaging: Remove, Reduce, Recycle, Reuse, Renew.  The 3M 
packaging and sourcing team continue s to focus on optimizing new product packaging as well as 
continuously reviewing and improving existing packaging.  All packaging improvements receive a 
technical packaging review and/or go through package ship testing to ensure the new designs will move 
safely through the supply chain.   
 
The corporate packaging teams continue to understand and evaluate emerging packaging materials that 
support design improvements from renewable or recyclable sources.  Reusable packaging items are 
considered and integrated where it makes sense from a process, technical, and economic aspect.  
 
Packaging Challenges and Opportunities  
3M’s diversity of products and packaging in a variety of markets globally offer both k ey challenges and 
opportunities that include:  
• Diverse  Requirements -Marketing, Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Customers, Merchandising  
• Global Materials and Substantiation  
• Different Regulatory and Industry Requirements  
• Waste Stream/Recycling Infrastructure  
• Cost Effective and Bio- material S olutions  
 
Key focus areas:  
• Rigid Plastic Packaging  
• - Working to increase post -consumer recycled content  or use alternative 
packaging solutions  
Polyvinyl Chloride ( PVC
• ) - Working to eliminate PVC in packaging where technically and 
economically feasible  
Heavy Metals  
 - Monitoring and verifying supplier compliance with laws regulating heavy metals 
in packaging . 
Setting Goals and Evaluating Performance  
3M’s global packaging team is committed to driving sustainable packaging design solutions .  To quantify 
packaging design improvement imp acts, packaging design optimization improvements made by 
packaging engineers   are entered into a 3M developed, packaging sustainability reporting tool.  Several 
metrics are tracked.  The weight s avings data and sales volume are compiled each month to calcul ate 60 
 actual pounds removed from waste streams  due to design changes . Improvement data on all items are 
tracked for 12 months.   3M is expandin g these reporting tools internally to global packaging design 
teams  in 2013.  The chart below is a U.S example of a m etric that is currently tracked -total amount of 
packaging avoided from landfill waste streams  based on packaging design changes . 
  
Packaging Collaboration  
In late 2013, 3M will be hosting a Supplier  Sustainability Expo where existing and new suppliers with 
unique sustainability solutions will be invited to engage with 3M businesses to share and exchange 
innovative packaging solutions and/or emerging technology offerings  and needs .  The expo will serv e as 
a catalyst for sparking new sustainable packaging ideas throughout 3M’s value chain.  
 
Reducing Packaging Footprint for our Customers  
A variety of projects have been implemented within the company  worldwide and across many businesses  
to reduce our pack aging footprint.  For packaging optimization highlights, visit our 3M packaging

POLLUTION PREVENTION PAYS (3P) 
3M’s Pollution Prevention Pays program celebrated its 3 7th anniversary in 2012.  Over that last 37  years, 
the program has prevented more than 1.9 million metric tons  of pollutants and saved nearly $1.7  billion 
(USD) based on aggregated data from the first  year of each 3P project.   The 3P program helps prevent 
pollution at the source, in products and manufacturing processes rather than removing it after is has 
been created.  When the 3P  program  was launched in 1975, the concept of applying pollution prevent ion 
on a companywide basis and documenting the results was an industry first.  
 Active and thriving today, t he 3P program invites participation from all aspects of the company including 
research and development, manufacturing, logistics, transportation, and  packaging employees with 
various award categories and criteria.  
 
3P is a key element of our environmental strategy and is advancing our sustainability efforts.  3P has 
achieved  that status based on our belief that a prevention approach is more environment ally effective, 
socially acceptable, and more economical than co nventional pollution controls.  3P seeks to eliminate 
pollution through the following methods:  
 
• Product R eformulation  
• Process Modif ication/Redesign  
• Equipment Redesign  
• Supply Chain Improvements  
• Recycl ing and Reuse of Waste Materials  
 
The program depends directly on the voluntary participation of 3M employees.  Innovative projects 
selected by a 3P committee representing R&D, engineering, EHS, manufacturing, and supply chain 
organizations are recog nized for t heir achievements with 3P awards.

 Leveraging Diversity  
Diversity and inclusion is a 3M business strategy  in which we are working to embed cultural competence 
in all talent and business processes.   3M’s Employee Resource Networks ( ERNs) are an integral part of 
3M’s business grow.  The networks below drive networking, engagement, and development of diverse 
populations, provide insight and education to the company and employee specific to diverse populations, 
provide leadership opportunities, influence change, and sponsor and participate in community outreach 
on behalf of 3M.  All ERN s align their strategies wit h 3M’s visions, strategy and human resource 
principles.  
 
3M Employee Resource Networks and Business Resource Teams include:  
• disAbility Awareness Network 
• Latino Resource Network 
• Military Support Network  
• African American Network  
• Native American Network  
• New Employee Opportunity Network 
• Gay Lesbian Bisexual  & Transgender ( GLBT+) Network

Engaging Diverse Perspectives   
 
Employee Resource Networks  partner with 3M businesses to tackle specific business challenges.  What 
results from the partnerships among the groups is impressive.  Many of our employee resource networks  
are able to identify significant market potential in specific customer segments – some of which include millions of cu rrent or potential customers.   Some examples of ERN work is provided below.  
 
• Our employee resource network, GLBT
+, was instrumental in driving changes to our policies and 
benefits offerings.  As a result, we were recognized  as a Best Place to Work for LGBT  Equality 
with a rating of 100 percent again.   Last year , the Human Rights Commission put more stringent 
requirements  into the survey and out of 315 companies,  only 190 companies  achieved a 100 
percent rating .  
 
• Our businesses are lev eraging employee resource networks  to accelerate growth in emerging 
markets.  For example, the Industrial and Transportation Business partnered with the Latino Resource Network to understand how to engage and sell to diverse customers using a 
multicultural business develop ment process.  
 70 
 • Team Africa has been working with 3M businesses to help apply 3M technology to develop 
products suitable for the African market such as affordable water solutions and solar cooking 
solutions.  
 
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is evidenced in our ongoing support of national diverse organizations, our support of education especially in science and technology and the external recognition 
we have received for our inclusive policies and practices.

their GESPP investments for everything from home improvement p rojects to funding their children’s 
and grandchildren’s educations.  3M has encouraged employees to become owners of the company 
through the GESPP since 1964‚ when the company introduced the plan.  Today‚ more than 40 
countries have adopted the plan‚ more than 63‚000 employees worldwide are eligible and more than 
16‚000 employees currently participate in the plan.

including child care and elder care.  3M offers Child Care and Adult Care Consultation and Referral 
services through the 3M Employee Assistance Program in order to help employees locate appropriate

locations outside of the United States, 3M offers employee assistance resources at the local level. Resources enhance well- being and effectiveness; prevent problems; or address a wide range of 
personal, family, work or behavioral health challenges: and are available online, in print literature 
and other media.  Topics include, but are not limited to: resiliency, stress management, shift work, 
anxiety, depression , alcohol use, drug abuse, personal financial and legal problems, and supporting 
employees and family members in grief or other troubling situations.  In addition, 3M offers U.S. 
employees Legal and Financial Consultation and Referral services through the EAP.  Financial issues 
include debt management  and taxes, while legal issues include family, civil, tax or criminal law.  
o 
Corporate- Supported Employee Groups:   Through 3M Clubs around the world, 3M encourages 
employees with shared interests to pursue those interests in a supportive environment. Every country in which 3M does business has a 3M employee club that sponsors special events, activity clubs and 
sports programs and offers special discounts and privileges in support of exercise, friendships and 
fun. The largest employee club is in St. Paul, Min n., and has approximately 7,000 members. 
Employee resource networks such as GLBT+ (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender, plus allies), African American Network, China ResourceNetwork, Disability Awarness Network, Latino Resource Network, Military Support  Network, Native American Network, New Employee Opportunity Network 72 
 (NEON), South Asia Network, Team Austin and the Women's Leadership Network are sponsored by

concerns with their work responsibilities.  3M employees are able to explore a variety of flexible 
work arrangements with their management, including part -time, job share, flex -time, compressed 
work week and telecommuting.  These opportunities are communicated to employees through management and are administered through 3M internal systems . 
o 
Health Living:  
 One way we promote an enjoyable work culture is by providing a work environment 
where healthy living is easy and where health and wellness is promoted.  3M employees enjoy 
multiple Healthy Living offerings.  One example is 3M’s monthly Healthy Living Newsletter.  All U.S. employees with e- mail get this monthly e -newsletter highlighting events and employee stories.  3M 
employees who do not work at computers have access to a paper copy of the same content.  Among 
e-mail newsletter recipients across the United States, we saw an average monthly newsletter open 
rate of 65.7 percent during October, November and December  - consistent with open rates during 
previous months .  Our  research finds that 3Mers enjoy reading personal stories about how others in 
the company have been successful at gaining renewed health.  That ’s no surprise to us!  Sharing 
healthy living stories is just one more way 3Mers collaborate and challenge each other to do more 
and be better for our customers and ourselves.   3M employees also have access to such programs 
as Lunch and Learns, tobacco cessation programs, on site flu vaccines, maternity programs and lots more.  
o 
 
Additional Resources and Opportunities Offered Globally

Education, Learning and Career Growth  
Today’s business  environment demands that we become faster and more flexible in anticipating and 
exceeding the needs of our customers, shareholders and employees. Creating a high performance 
culture built on continuous learning will help 3M achieve business growth for the company and 
professional growth for employees.  From 200 7 to 201 2, 3M invested $3.4 million in education and 
learning programs . 
 
o New Employee On boarding :  3M invests in on boarding  and developing new employees so that 
our employees have the tools, resour ces and networks they need to succeed.  After all, 3M 
success depends on individual employee success.  Our on boarding  process begins at the time a 
candidate accepts a job offer and continues through the first year of employment.  This 
investment in on boarding  is indicative of how 3M treats people, does business, improves 
retention and sets new employees up to make meaningful contributions from the start.  Instituting a 3M -wide on boarding process is also one way we help supervisors and managers 
support  employee growth and achievement consistently throughout the company.  In addition, 
3M on boarding  processes are designed to make the best possible first impression and welcome 73 
 employees to 3M in a way that garners their commitment and dedication.  To achi eve all these 
things, we have developed a two- stage, two- technology approach to on boarding .  
 The first stage is a globally internally -developed and built on boarding portal available to 
new employees, hiring managers, assigned buddies and human resources professionals 
to help them consistently and effectively onboard and develop new employees.  We have 
also created a pre- start portal to engage new employees in advance of their start. 
Through this portal, prospective employees can find valuable information about 3M, how to accept their offer, next steps in the employment process, what to expect the first day 
and employee resources including networks, clubs and events as well as relocation 
guides and policy handbooks.  
 
 The second stage is called SuccessFactors (Verifications Inc) through SAP. 
SuccessFactors will be deployed globally beginning in October 2013 and finalized by May 
2014.  The implementation of SuccessFactors, is an example of 3M continuous 
improvement: taking a successful process to an enhanced level.  SuccessFactors will include the same process features available in the stage one process, plus more.  
 Seamless delivery by one system from recruiting through to on boarding  
 Advanced reporting and analytics for continuous improvement  
 Timeline- autom ated task and information flow at the right time to the right 
people.  
 Business - and function- specific on boarding  packages.  
 Internal transfer, merger and acquisition, and high volume production employee program support  
 Paperless processes – for many hiring processes globally as new hires will electronically complete, sign and submit important employment documents.
 
 SuccessFactors will support onboarding processes in 65 countries in 23 languages consistently
 
 
Skill Mapping and Contribution and Developme nt Assessment
 :  3M has  separate processes for 
employee performance and career development reviews.  Each year, every 3M non -production 
employee identifies their contributions in meeting their specified goals through an employee 
performance review system.  In addition non -production employees create an individual 
development plan that includes the next year’s set of goals to elevate individual performance and 
skills.  Additional skill mapping tools may be used in collaboration with the employee’s supervisor to 
identify long -term desired goals.  3M strives to have 100% of non -production employees receiving 
performance and career development reviews at least annually.  In 2012 approximately 72% of 
global non -production employees completed and received a perform ance review.   Contribution and 
development assessments for production staff follow site specific procedures depending on local requirements and business specific needs.   
o 
Accelerated Leadership Development
• Our senior management team is strengthening our leadership talent by selectively recruiting proven leaders from outside the company for key functional and business roles to lead our 
businesses in new directions.  :  3M views leadership development as a competitiv e advantage 
and is accelerating leadership development in a variety of ways:  74 
 • 3M's senior management team has identified six key leadership attributes.  All employees are 
expected to think from the outside in; drive innovation and growth; develop, teach and engage 
others; make courageous decisions;  lead with energy, passion and urgency; and live 3M values.  
These attributes have been incorporated into our performance assessment and development process for most of 3M’s salaried workforce and all of its supervisory, management and executive employees so that we can regularly assess the extent to which employees' behavior 
demonstrate these attributes to help them develop their leadership behaviors.  
• 3M is identifying leaders and giving all employees the tools to develop leadership throughout their careers.  We are also investing in the development of leaders through the Leadership 
Development Programs, which include training programs for all employees, supervisors and 
managers.  We offer several intense accelerated learning development experiences for 
supervisors, managers and directors.  Participants experience real- life learning by working on 
3M business issues and presenting recommendations to senior management.  
• Employees have access to an intranet site dedicated to their career and personal developme nt.  
The site provides a strategic career planning process, information to guide employees as they set goals and document contributions, access to on -demand learning modules and suites of 
courses, mentoring guidelines and tips for aligning career goals to 3M bu siness goals for greater 
success at 3M.  
• While 3M leaders have always been known for sharing best practices, especially technological 
breakthroughs, today's leaders at 3M have a passion for learning and sharing ideas.  There's an 
increased emphasis on acti on learning and "leaders teaching leaders" including teaching, 
coaching and mentoring by leaders at the highest levels of the organization.  
• Learning has also taken a new place within the value chain for 3M businesses. Leaders are 
leveraging new learning t echnologies and blended learning solutions to improve employee 
access to learning content and performance support tools.  They are also focused on decreasing the cost of traditional learning events and increasing customer and channel partner loyalty.  
Learning has become a more valuable and measurable business strategy  
 
  
o 
Tuition Reimbursement :
   In 3M locations around the world, employees are encouraged to 
continuously learn and improve their skills.  In most countries where we do business, 3M offers, with 
management support, tuition reimbursement to encourage employees to upgrade their education to better meet current job responsibilities, prepare for future responsibilities and help qualify for 
changes in career paths within 3M.  
o 
Mentoring:   Through the 3M Mentoring Network, the organization encourages self -directed mentoring 
partnerships.  3M employees know or can easily learn  that they can identify and recruit mentors 
themselves.  This way, employees are able to establish relationships and g et advice from leaders 
whom they may already know and respect and anyone else in the company willing to be a mentor .  
Mentors are identified globally throughout the company by adding the tag “Mentor Available” to their Connections Profile.  This allows self selection by the mentor – and self -removal if they have enough 
mentees.  When a mentee then starts the process of finding a mentor they complete a search on the 
“Mentor Available” tag which returns the most current list of mentors at 3M.  Connections als o allow  
additional tags to be added to find more specific expertise.  The Mentoring Network also has a wiki page for "How to Become a Mentor" which highlights requirements and nuts and bolts process 
information for becoming a mentor.  A similar page exists  for mentees called "How to Become a 75 
 Mentee."  The wiki augments  supports and uses information and structured materials provided on 
the 3M HR Mentoring web page.   Some organizations have assisted mentoring programs to help 
identify and recruit mentors to m eet the needs of specific individuals.  An online Mentoring Program 
Design Kit with guidelines for developing and implementing a mentoring program in alignment with 
strategic business objectives is available to support organizations wanting to offer mentor ing 
programs.  An  executive diversity mentoring program supports the professional development of high 
performing minority and women employees.  Since January 2002, more than 730 females and minorities have enrolled in this program . 
 
o 
Outplacement Assistance
 :  3M offers a range of outplacement services and resources for employees 
whose positions are eliminated due to business needs. These resources are offered on a worldwide 
basis to help employees transition to employment in other areas of 3M or outside of t he company 
and include services such as development of career transition skills and identification of job placement opportunities.  In addition, 3M has an internal recruiting website that lists current 3M 
position openings for employees to self -nominate as  well as career development information and 
tools.  
Communication and Technology Networks   
3M has numerous pathways to support organizational communications, learning and knowledge 
management.  There are a variety of corporate and job functional systems t o methodically help 
information and knowledge emerge and flow to the right people at the right time to add value.  Examples 
are detailed below:  
  
Formal Learning Networks:   The Learning Solution is 3M’s corporate learning management system and is 
a one- stop electronic learning center that helps employees enroll in, deliver, track and report on learning 
activities.  The Learning Solution serves the learning needs of 3M business units, plants and learning organizations globally . 
 
Intranet Knowledge Platforms Databases :   
• 3M's intranet site structure is set up so that each employee has a "Work Center" as one of the quick link tabs following login.  Each work center is a collection of tools, systems and processes 
that are used routinely in daily work practices t o successfully complete projects/work 
assignments in an employee’s functional work area.  A link to other work centers is also available.   3M also has a database for global communicators that houses key corporate 
information and enables them to translate e mployee news articles and distribute them to their 
local audiences via e- mail.  
• Company news for employees is available on a global news site called Spark 3M News.  It 
enables employees to share news articles, videos and links with others both internally and 
externally via e- mail and social media.  Because it is a public site available on a platform that 
displays the information to laptops, tablets and smart phones , Spark is easily accessible by 
employees anywhere they have an Internet connection .  
 
Best Pr actice Descriptions/Processes :  As a diverse technical company, 3M shares best practices several 
ways.  Two of the most widely used internal organizations are the 3M Tech Forum and the 3M 
Engineering Technology Organization (ETO).  These two organizations provide an extensive network of 76 
 expertise through specialized chapters focused on 3M's core technologies and other emerging markets.  
Employees in R&D, manufacturing and other parts of the supply chain are able to collaborate and drive 
innovation globally across the organization . 
 
Company Education Facility :  In addition to a variety of general courses, webinars, etc., 3M offers 
specialized extended courses to increase skills such as the 3M Leadership Development Institute, the 3M 
Marketing University and t he General Managers’ and Managing Directors’ (GM&MD) program.  
 
Idea Management :  Idea management is driven differently across the company depending on 
organizational needs and what works best for the area of work.  Some platform examples include Innovation Live, Wiki Enterprise, and 3M internal and external social media channels.  All systems are implemented and available globally to share best practices and ideas.

EASURING  AND RECOGNIZING EMPLOYEE  ENGAGEMENT   
As 3M corporate policy, a standard opinion survey is administered to all employees at locations 
worldwide once every two years.  The information received is used to address employee concerns and 
identify opportunities for improvement.  In addition, custom or “mini” surveys can be used by business 
units to gather additional information either as a follow up to the standard opinion survey or to go more in-depth on a particular topic.  A variety of other 360 feedback tools are also available upon demand.  
 
Since 2006, key survey content and follow -up actions have focused on employee engagement.  3M 
knows that employee engagement is good for the company and employees.  Engaged employees are more satisfied with their work, tend to stay and are more productive and committed.  3M’s multi- faceted 
approach to engaging employees focuses on key drivers of engagement, such as career development 
and providing roles that are meaningful and aligned with company goals and values.  Our leaders – 
including supervisors and manag ers – play a critical role in fostering engagement through daily 
interactions and special- purpose conversations – such as Employment Value Discussions that focus on 
individual employee development.  3M requires leaders to foster engagement actively – this expectation 
is included in our Leadership Attributes listing, which applies to all 3M leaders and links to their annual performance assessment.  3M supports leaders in these efforts via formal training (engagement is 
embedded in leadership classes), videos  and on -demand tools.   
 
3M’s extensive work on employee engagement has been documented in several sources including 
“Engagement at 3M: A Case Study” a chapter in 
The Executive Guide to Integrated Talent Management  
(eds. Oakes & Galagan) published by The A merican Society for Training and Development (ASTD) (2011) 
and “In the Company We Trust” an article in HR Magazine (2011).  
  
Similarly, 3M’s engagement efforts have been recognized in a number of ways including Best -Practice 
by the American Productivity  & Quality Center  (APQC) for “Rewarding, Engaging, and Retaining Key 
Talent,” as profiled by the Society for Human Resource Management  (SHRM) in the video for HR Best 
Practices in Leadership Assessment, Succession and Development .  Other awards include Top 
Companies for Leaders  sponsored by the Hay Group, Best Companies for Leaders led by Hewitt and 
Associates, and top 10 on the 2013 Best Companies for Leaders , conducted by the Cha lly Group for CEO 
Magazine.  Finally, 3M has been recognized as a premier company to work for by numerous groups 
including the Great Place to Work® Institute, appearing on a number of their lists (Best Workplace, Best 
Companies, etc.).  77 
  
 
Employee Rewards a nd Recognition  
Hard work and extra effort are rewarded and recognized at 3M through an array of award programs.  3M 
sponsors many corporate award programs to honor individuals and teams that make significant contributions to the company.  In addition, many divisions, departmental areas of business and staff units 
also have their own specific ways of recognizing and rewarding people.  Across 3M, management can 
choose from a variety of monetary and non -monetary awards to show appreciation for  exceptional 
contributions.  Examples of corporate awards include:

 GLOBAL SAFETY AND  HEALTH  
3M has a long history of e nsuring global Safety  and Health  commitmen t to all employees.  3M’s Safety 
and Health Policy applies to all 3M operations, including new acquisitions.  It is based on our core 
business values and stems from our Environmental, Health, and Safety vision for “Safe and Healthy 
People, Products and Planet.”   The policy confirms 3M’s commitment to protecting the safety  and health  
of those working at or visiting a 3M location.  
 Corporate Safety  and Industrial Hygiene op erations executes the vision, strategies and policy by 
partnering  with each of the five business units worldwide to develop and implement practical preven tive 
and risk based solutions;  driving  safety  health  excellence throughout the company.   All visitor s, vendors, 
and contract workers at 3M locations are held to the same safety and health requirements as 3M 
employees, therefore consistent management systems and evaluation tools are critical to company safety 
and health success.  
 
Safety and Health Managem ent System & Performance  
 In 1996, a Global Safety & Health Plan (GSHP) tool was 
initiated for all 3M locations worldwide and is a well 
developed self assessment categorized into multiple 
elements addressing various areas and standards related of safety and health.  The GSHP tool is an integral part of 3M’s global safety and health 
management systems, which allow locations and  the 
corporation as a whole to assess the current status 
versus various safety and health systems requirements.  
Using a standardized assessment approach allows for meaningful performance results to be shared 
throughout the company.  Through implementation of 
this tool, each 3M location  develops applicable safety 
and health management systems, identifies gaps in their safety and health  programs/performance, and 
develops plans to close gaps and drive continuous 
improvement in their own safety and performance.

Safety and Health Committees  
3M seeks employee participation at all levels to assure involvement and ownership of safety and health 
programs and systems.  This involvement is critical to achieving effective, proactive solutions to safety 
and health issues. Increasing employee ownership and involvement in the safety and health process helps provide a safer, healthier work place. Emphasis is placed on a cooperative effort between 
management and employees in achieving these goals.  Examples of these efforts where employee 
participation and involvement is critical are listed below:  
 
• Safety and health committees  
• Safety and health suggestion programs  
• Safety and health orient ation and training  
• Safety and health self -surveys  
• Job hazard analysis  
• Ergonomics teams  
• Behavioral based safety processes  
• Process safety management  
• Fire protection plan  
• Potential hazard reporting programs  
• Participation in investigations and prompt follow -up of incidents and potential hazards  
 
Safety and Health Committees are the most active and visible way that this is demonstrated within 3M.  In fact, this aspect is represented by its own standard of performance in the GSHP that requires locations to establish and maintain active safety and health committees.  They are defined specifically as an 
organized group of employees from all levels of the facility whose function is to support the safety and 
health management system by identifying preventive and corrective measures needed to eliminate or 
control recognized safety and health hazards.  
  80 
 The Safety and Health committee is usually chaired by facility management or an appointed 
representative with responsibility and authority for making decisions f or the facility.  If the committee is 
not chaired by senior management, the chair must be accountable to senior management.  
 
The committee membership must include representatives from the non -supervisory work force.  
Representatives can be elected, appoint ed or volunteer.  Committee membership includes representation 
from all departments or functional areas in the organization or facility.  Committee members can represent multiple functional areas or departments.   
 Objectives of Safety and Health Committees:  
• Review current safety and health issues and document goals for making steady progress toward achieving their safety and health objectives,  
• Develop action plans and assign responsibilities for completing goals and objectives to resolve safety and health issues,  
• Provide input into the development of safety and health policies and rules for the facility,  
• Identify and promote opportunities for management recognition of employee contributions to safety and health performance,  
• Review incidents, safety/health s uggestions and results of both self and external surveys,  
• Review safety and health suggestions and results of safety and health self evaluations and inspections.  
 
 
Setting Goals and Measuring Safety and Health Performance
Measuring leading indicators of Safety and Health performance is a key focus for 3M. Aggregated data 
from all Global Safety and Health Plan Assessments, Audits, and Incident reporting are evaluated to 
identify performance status and corporate wide opportun ities.  Metrics are tracked and reported for 
continuous improvement at the facility, business unit, regional, and corporate levels.  Initiatives such as improving quality and level of implementation of safely  and health management system elements 
(includin g preven tive measures) at each 3M site results in increased awareness, mature programs, and 
reduced  injury and illness rates.  In 2011, 3M set the following key corporate wide safety and health 
objectives  to continuosly improve related management systems and to proactively  reduce safety and 
health impacts.  Significant progress was made in 2012 for all objectives .

CRISIS  PLANNING  AND PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS  
The guiding principle that directs 3M’s decisions in an emergency or crisis is our unwavering 
commitment to protect 3M employees, assets, operations, and the communities in which we serve.  
3M’s  Corporate Crisis Management Team  comprised of senior and exec utive management  manages a 
wide range of crisis situations including pandemic preparedness.   
Every 3M facility has a facility/country crisis management team, plan, and associated communication/response strategies developed in the event of a crisis  situati on.  3M Corporate 
Occupational Medicine monitors global pandemic alerts and communicates the level of response depending on both the level of person to person contact and how widespread the disease is in humans.  
 3M’s Crisis Management Planning Guidelines are provided to all 3M businesses and fac ility locations 
worldwide.  3M’s requirement is for each location to develop  a current Crisis Management Plan.  The 
Crisis Management Planning Guidelines are designed to provide a common framework for integrating crisis management into the standard operations of each 3M facility.  All plans must be prepared in 
accordance with good engineering practices and with the full approval of management at a level with 86 
 authority to commit the necessary resources.  All plans are also expected to align with local rules, 
regulations, and requirements.   Scenario exercises are conducted at facilities to evaluate the 
effectiveness and response of their crisis management plan with a likely potential crisis for that area/region . 
 
In order to prepare 3M for the possibility of a pandemic, the 3M Corporate Crisis Management Team includes a cross -functional Corporate Pandemic Preparedness Team.  The Corporate Pandemic 
Preparedness Team has developed a Corporate Pandemic Preparedness Planning Guide.  The Planning Guide builds on guidelines and recommendations utilizing materials and best practices from a number of 
resources including pandemic planning recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO), 
U.S. Centers for Disease Cont rol (CDC), government and other multinational company plans.  The goals of 
the Pandemic Preparedness  Planning Guide are to prevent and control the spread of disease within 3M 
and maintain business continuity by delivering essential products and services to 3M customers .  
 
Response measures for disease prevention and control are categorized under the following areas:  public 
health communication and education; medical prevention and protection; social distancing and medical surveillance; workplace hygiene; medical supplies and resources; and business travel, Foreign Service 
employees and families.  3M Corporate Occupational Medicine monitors global pandemic alerts and 
communicates the level of response depending on both the level of person to person contact and how widespread the disease is in humans . 
 
3M communicates to global employees through the Pandemic Preparedness  internal website which 
provides information and alerts about current or emerging pandemics, prevention and protection measure, emergency preparedness, travel advisories and procedures, and frequently asked questions.  
 In 2013, 3M is implementing an additional US emergency communications system to alert employees via automated text or voicemail on electronic mobile devices in the event an emergency arises.

 ENGAGING OUR SUPPLIERS  
All 3M suppliers are expected to comply with applicable laws.  T hose expectations are embedded in 3M 
Contract and Purchase Order terms.  3M supplements those contractual requirements with Supply Chain 
Policies that specifically address environmental, health, safety, transportation and labor/human resources 
practices an d the content/origin of materials supplied to 3M.  Those Policies apply to the selection and 
retention of suppliers and establish a framework that 3M considers important to a safe and healthy 
workplace, the maintenance of fair and reasonable labor and huma n resource practices (including the 
prohibition of slavery and human trafficking), management of manufacturing and distribution operations to minimize adverse environmental impact and compliance with material content/origin laws.  3M 
expects suppliers to establish programs that are consistent with those p olicies.   
 
Supplier EHS/Labor/Transportation Performance  
3M periodically monitors supplier performance against its Policy expectations.  Assessing that 
performance is challenging because of 3M's many thousands of suppliers, numerous supply chain tiers and complex global supply chains.  3M has implemented  a risk- based supplier assessment process to 
help assure that its suppliers meet its expectations:  
 
• Suppliers are ranked using a prioritization matrix  tool.  
• The mat rix takes into account country,  type of operations , and annual 3M purchases.  
• Prioritized suppliers may be asked to complete a self -assessment survey (SAS).  
• The SAS is used to understand supplier programs and whether they meet the intent of 3M  
Policies.  
• An on -site audit may be conducted.  
• If any deficiencies are identified during an on -site visit, a correction plan is developed.  
• 3M conducts follow -up audits or other communications to assure that deficiencies are corrected.  
 
The supplier audit process covers environmental, health and safety practices and training, general working conditions, emergency response procedures, hazardous materials management including transportation protocols and employment practices.  Onsite audits  are conducted by 3M staff in most 
cases, but 3M may use third party audit firms as necessary.  The assessment program has independent oversight from the 3M EHS Advisory Committee.  Customer or general public concerns can be brought to 
3M’s attention via p hone or website: (
http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/About/3M/ ). 
 
More than 1,800 self -assessments or on -site audits of suppliers have been conducted in  prioritized 
countries:  Ch ina, India, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, Russia and Turkey over the 
past six years.  Suppliers reviewed in the last three ye ars represent 78 % of 3M's 2012 spend in the 
listed countries .  Most suppliers met 3M’s expectations.  Those requiring improvement were given 
specific corrective action in order to retain 3M business.  Suppliers with corrective action must pass a 
3M re- qualification assessment after completing the necessary steps.  
 
The most common audit findings pertain to machine guarding, human resource documentation and pay 
controls.   Most suppliers work very quickly to address any 3M findings.  Those suppliers unwilling or 
unable to take the necessary corrective action in a timely manner have been terminated by 3M.  
 88 
 In addition to existing suppliers , many potential suppliers have been evaluated using the assessment  
tools.  Several 3M businesses have incorporated supplier EHS and labor considerations into life cycle 
management reviews and have independently performed assessments of key suppliers.  
 
Supplier Development  
3M communicates its sustainability expectations to suppliers through contract clauses, specifications, 
and links  to 3M’s website and in direct business meetings.  Improving energy efficiency and reducing 
waste are common supplier meeting agenda items.  3M has expanded its involvement with the U .S. EPA 
“Energy Star” program by promoting the pledge program with key suppliers and has hosted a best 
practice seminar.  
 
Sourcing Training  
3M Sourcing staff with responsibility for supplier relationships receive training on all aspects of supply 
chain sustainability, including slavery and human trafficking prohibitions.  Most recently 3M has provided training on understanding and managing environmental preference factors in s upplier selection.  
 
Supplier Diversity  
Sourcing from diverse businesses that are small, minority -owned, woman -owned, small veteran -owned, 
service -disabled veteran -owned and certified HUBZone is an important factor in how 3M purchases 
goods and services.  T hese businesses comprise a vital, growing segment of our economy and offer 
great potential for helping 3M obtain best value, innovation, growth, and diverse goods and services.  In 
addition small and diverse businesses provide economic and social energy to the communities in which 
we operate.  3M is committed to aggressively and proactively identifying diverse business sources for all goods and services purchased.  3M works to solicit capable firms and execute orders and contracts with 
those firms as requir ed to support 3M business needs.  Sourcing personnel have access to various 
supplier diversity directories and resources to assist in identifying sources.  
 
When awarding business to diverse suppliers, 3M also considers the community impact.  Changing deman d patterns may require 3M to reduce spend with a particular supplier.  If 3M purchases represent 
a high percentage of that supplier's total business, local employment opportunities can be affected.  3M attempts to manage its spend levels with individual su ppliers to avoid this type of community impact.  
 
3M’s Partners and Suppliers website is the gateway to learn more about 3M’s supplier requirements and our diversity initiative:  
www.3M.com/Partners/Suppliers  
 
Supplier Information 
3M uses product responsibility databases and tools to better manage environmental and health and 
safety information related to 3M products.  Extensive efforts have been taken with 3M suppliers to gather 
product composition/origin information and other environmental, health and safety data to ensure 
compliance with applicable laws wherever 3M does business and respond to customer inquiries.    
Paperless Transactions  
In addition to the 3M Environmental Solutions Catalogs, 3M has worked to e -enable many business e-
commerce processes.  In the US, 85percent  of purchase orders are sent electronically, 92 percent of 
purchase order invoices are received electronically and 75  percent of payments are paperless.  This has 89 
 eliminated tens of thousands of paper documents per year.  In a recent third -party benchmark study,

3M’s investment in communities, where the company op erates, reflects the philosophy and practice of 
our governing principles since 1902.  Early on, corporate leadership understood the importance of 
community vitality to business success.  Community engagement was encouraged at all levels of the 
company.  Ou r first volunteer program dates back to 1949 through Junior Achievement.  In 1953, to 
formalize 3M corporate philanthropy, the 3M Foundation was established.  CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT  
 Since 1953, 3M and the 3M Fo undation have invested over $1.3  billion in cash and product in 3M 
communities around the world.  Significant international contributions add to this total.  Today, Belgium, 
Spain, Italy and Brazil maintain their own foundations and all other international subsidiaries manage 
corporate giving programs benefiting education, social services or the environment.  
 
3M is not only a company that creat es; it is a company that cares -improving lives each day.   In 2012, 3M 
awarded more than $56 million to non -profit organizations.  These global  donations were bolstered by 
many thousands of employee and retiree volunteers  serving hundreds of thousands of hours . 
 
Mission  
The mission of 3M’s Community Giving – Improving Every Life – is rooted in the 3M Corporate Vision:  
 
3M Technology Advancing Every Company  
3M Products Enhancing Every Hom e 
3M Innovation Improving Every Life  
 This alignment leverages our giving strategy as we partner with staff and business groups to solve 
community problems and live out the mission of improving every life.

STAKEHOLDER INTERACTION  
 
Meeting the Needs and Keeping in Touch  
In our efforts to advance Sustainability, we continuously strive to maintain a continuous and open 
dialogue with the community, shareholders, employees, retirees and other interested parties concerning past achievements and future sustain ability goals.  We are members of  
• The Conference Board Contributions Council  
• American Council of Corporate Contributions Professionals  
• London Benchmarking Group  
• Technology Affinity Group  
• A Billion + Change  
• United Way Worldwide Global Corporate Leadership Advisory Council  
 
Association with these organizations increases  our effectiveness as we engage with peer 
companies to learn about national and global trends, best practices in program administration, 
evaluation, communication and reporting.  
 The interconnection of environmental stewardship, societal needs, and market opportunities informs 
continuous reassessment and sustainable development progress.  We remain committed to providing 
investors with an attractive return through sustained, high qua lity growth.   3M shares information 
regarding our efforts, focus areas, and relative growth through a number of online and printed 
publications, open houses, and facility tours.  
 
Engaging Stakeholders  
3M recognizes the connection community stakeholders hav e to business.  The discussions and 
interactions with stakeholders help the company keep awareness of emerging issues and respond in a 
responsible manner.  3M develops engagement plans and communicates with a wide variety of 
stakeholders at the corporate, regional, or local level.  3M strives to meet stakeholder expectations at a 
global level on global issues; however the majority of stakeholder interactions occur at the place where 
3M activities touch our stakeholders.  
 
Local and Regional Stakeholder Engag ement  
In 2005, 3M developed a new, more systematic local and regional stakeholder engagement process.  This new method was developed as a formalized process to help facilities establish a consistent, 
documented, and proactive system to drive engagement.  As part of 3M’s 2015 Sustainability Goals, 
facilities selected on a risk- prioritized basis are to complete and document the following activities:  
• Identify critical stakeholders  
• Analyze and evaluate their current stakeholder engagement activities  
• Identify c ommunications opportunities  
• Identify local community needs and align with 3M’s giving priorities  
• Develop and implement a stakeholder engagement plan  
• Measure the plan’s effectiveness through charitable giving results and engagement activities  
 91 
  
 
Stakeholder  Engagement Plans  
Approximately 113  manufacturing facilities globally have completed a stakeholder engagement plan.  
Many of these plans are rooted in 3M Community Relations Councils’ (CRC) Giving Plans that define 
regional strategies in states where 3M has multiple facilities.  Established over twenty years ago, CRCs are designed to connect 3M facilities with the local community through grants to education, social and 
environmental organizations.  While facilities will develop a stakeholder engagement plan  using 
developed guidelines, the engagement tactics employed by each location are developed to meet the needs of regional or local stakeholders.  3M locations use a wide range of methods to consult and 
interact with stakeholders:  
• Neighbor Meetings  
• Employee Meetings  
• Employee Surveys  
• Community Newsletters  
• Facility Open Houses and Tours  
• Active Participation in Local Civic Groups  
• Participation in Community O rganizations (e.g. chambers of commerce, task forces, nonprofit 
boards, mentoring in schools)  
• Facility Websites  
• Grantmaking and Product D onations  
• Volunteerism

3M’s community giving is collected through a manual, self -report ing process rather than through 
traditional accounting systems due to the decentralized nature of community giving outside the U.S.  This year, a global SharePoint site was created and a survey was developed within the SharePoint site to collect the data that is accessible to all countries.  The data was provided by the manager of each 
country ’s community giving program  or their designee. A total of  27 countries responded to this survey; 
this is not an all- inclusive calculation as all countries did not report.  
 Going forward we expect im proved accounting as the SharePoint will be built out during 2013 with each 
country inserting information about their programs.  To recognize the 60
th Anniversary of the U.S. 3M 
Foundation and global engagement in volunteerism, a Global Day of Volunteering  is planned in 
September 2013.  The SharePoint will be used to track activities by each country and to drive 
engagement monthly email messages will be sent with global updates and best practices.  
 
EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION  
3M encourages volunteerism to enhance the quality of life in our communities; to support volunteers’ 
efforts by sharing information about community needs and volunteer opportunities, and to recognize the sharing of time and talents to make a difference in our communities.  Community participation and 
volunteer service is especially encouraged at management levels, and therefore, their respective 
employees.  
  Employees can participate in a variety of ways:  
• Volunteer service on non -profit boards or community projects  
• Service on 3M advisory committees that shape funding priorities and assist with the review of 
grants  
• 3M Volunteer Match with contributions to nonprofit organizations where employees volunteer 20 hours or more and retirees volunteer 25 hours or mor e per year  
• 3M College and University Match is ongoing throughout the year and special matches are offered for hunger relief and the environment

REPORT DATA COLLECTION , ADJUSTMENTS  AND VERIFICATION  
The data provided in this report through facts and figures is  based on activit ies during 3M’s fiscal year 
2012 (January 1, 2012- December 31, 2012).  For some performance indicators previous year’s data is 
provid ed to allow for annual comparis ons. DATA PERIOD

Due to the size and geographical extent of our operations, it is at times difficult to obtain all data points.  
Therefore to the extent possible, limitations and assumptions are stated as information is presented in the report.  The data reported in this report  has been reviewed for accuracy and completeness, including 
the reliability of the systems used to obtain the data by corporate staff professionals  in each area.  
Corporate staff have also verified the implementation  of policies and management systems through 
audits and self -reporting systems.  REPORT DATA COLLECTION  
 
• Financial Data:
   Financial information referenced in this report is collected and reporting in 
accordance to United States Securities and Exchange Commission through the 2012  Annual 
Report.  
• Environmental, Health, and Safety Data:
   The environmental, health, and safety data in this report 
is related to release to the environment, safety performance, management systems implementation , and regulatory compliance.  Data collection system s are in place at the 
applicable sites  to track and collect environmental and safety data through the corporate- wide 
EHS reporting systems ( e.g. Environmental Targets Database, Worldwide Incident Management 
System) . 
• 
Social Data
 :  The data related to employee metrics and community programs has been derived 
from various databases from with in the Human R esources and C ommunity Affairs organization s.  
This data has been reviewed and verified by the departments responsib le for maintaining the 
internal reporting systems.    
Sites acquired  by 3M are integrated into 3M programs and reporting systems via prioritized integration 
schedule .  Timeframe for integration varies depending on subject matter reporting requirements and site 
systems prior to being acquired, however on average integration ranges between 1 and 3 years.   
3M’s annual report (1 0K) and investor relations web site documents any changes to financial data.  
Several of 3M’s environmental goals are normalized per net sales.  3M does not adjust sales data for inflation.  BASE YEAR AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS  
 3M generally does not adjust its base year environmental metrics data to reflect changes in 3M’s organization structure .  As a result, 3M sets environmental targets that are normalized or indexed to 
production (tons emitted/net sales) to ensure the environmental progress we report publically is not unduly influence by c hanges to our organizational structure.  However, in the case of our greenhouse gas 
emissions data, 3M follows the World Resource Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development GHG P rotocol.  Consequently, we readjust our greenhouse gas emissions base year data in 
the case of business acquisitions and divestitures.  
 In every case, 3M adjusts base year and other year’s data if data collection methods change or data 
errors are identified.  Any significant changes in the measurement methods and/or data  values applied to 
key environmental metrics  from previous years are documented with the report’s content.  Significant 103 
 changes are defined by 3M’s Sustainability Report as changes greater than 5 % of the original data point.  
In the case of minor changes less than 5 % of the origi nal data point , the data poin t is modified to reflect 
the mi nor changes in measurement method or data.  
 
In 2011, 3M returned to a more conventional definition of waste which considered recycling as neutral 
(contributing n either toward total waste or toward good output).  Between 2005 and 2010 3M adopted a 
different definition of waste to drive the company’s waste reduction efforts toward more sustainable 
solutions, such as pollution prevention.  3M’s waste reduction goal a nd progress during this period 
included recycling.  Waste data is reported in this report using both definitions.  When total waste is discussed in general, a conventional recycling neutral definition is used.  
 
3M adjusts social metrics per the requirement s of polices, standards, and regulations in those respective 
areas.   For example employee headcount metrics would be reinstated accordingly if reorganization  
occurs to an existing legal entity.  
3M’s 2013 Sustainability report w as prepared using t he Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  G3.1 
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.  GRI is a voluntary reporting protocol used and supported by 3M and companies to promote international harmonization in the reporting of relevant and credible corporate 
environmental, social, and economic performance information.  Note:  GRI has not completed a formal 
check or verified contents of this report, nor does it take position on the reliability of the information 
reported herein.   REPORT AND DATA VERIFICATION

APPENDIX A: 
Assurance Statement  	  Scope	  of	  Assurance	  	  	  ISOS	  Group	  [“Assurance	  Provider”]	  has	  been	  commissioned	  by	  the	  management	  of	  3M	  to	  carry	  out	  an	  assurance	  engagement	  on	  the	  3M	  2013	  Sustainability	  Report	  covering	  activities	  from	  January	  1st,	  2012	  to	  December	  31st,	  2012.	  The	  scope	  of	  the	  assurance	  included:	  volatile	  organic	  compounds	  [“VOCs”],	  water	  (consumption,	  waste	  and	  conservation	  efforts),	  waste	  (levels,	  management	  practices	  and	  reduction	  efforts),	  exceedances	  and	  reportable	  spills	  (fines	  and	  corrective	  measures)	  and	  health	  and	  safety	  data	  (recordable	  incidents,	  lost	  time	  injury	  and/or	  illness	  cases),	  expressed	  on	  behalf	  of	  3M’s	  global	  operations.	  Other	  financial,	  energy	  usage	  and	  greenhouse	  gas	  emissions,	  social	  and	  labor	  information	  already	  verified	  through	  other	  methods	  has	  been	  excluded	  from	  the	  scope	  of	  this	  engagement.	  The	  review	  was	  conducted	  based	  on	  the	  Report	  content	  and	  supporting	  documentation	  made	  available	  during	  the	  verification	  period	  from	  March	  2013	  through	  June	  2013.	  	  	  Objectives	  	  The	  objective	  of	  the	  assurance	  engagement	  was	  to	  independently	  express	  conclusions	  on	  the	  subject	  matter	  as	  defined	  within	  the	  scope	  of	  work	  above,	  validate	  claims	  and	  evaluate	  systems	  for	  collecting	  and	  reporting	  data.	  All	  evaluative	  tasks	  were	  aimed	  at	  confirming	  3M’s	  conformance	  with	  the	  GRI	  G3.1	  Guidelines	  requirements	  for	  C+	  level	  sustainability	  reporting.	  	  Criteria	  and	  Level	  of	  Assurance	  	  The	  Assurance	  Provider	  carried	  out	  limited	  assurance	  on	  the	  selected	  key	  performance	  indicators	  and	  evaluated	  the	  Report’s	  adherence	  to	  GRI’s	  reporting	  principles	  for	  Quality,	  Content	  and	  Boundary	  Setting	  and	  AA1000	  Assurance	  Standard’s	  [“AA1000AS”]	  (2008)	  principles	  of	  Inclusivity,	  Materiality	  and	  Responsiveness	  in	  determining	  credibility	  of	  underlying	  processes.	  	  	  Methodology	  	  As	  part	  of	  the	  assurance	  engagement,	  the	  Assurance	  Provider	  verified	  the	  sustainability-­‐related	  statements	  and	  claims	  made	  in	  the	  sustainability	  Report,	  including	  internal	  processes,	  controls	  and	  supporting	  documentation	  supplied	  by	  3M,	  or	  found	  in	  the	  public	  domain.	  	  	  To	  form	  our	  conclusions,	  we	  undertook	  the	  following	  activities:	  	   Reviewed	  original	  sources	  of	  data	  for	  the	  indicators	  in	  scope	  of	  limited	  assurance	  to	  determine	  whether	  the	  data	  for	  these	  indicators	  as	  presented	  in	  the	  Report	  is	  accurate	  and	  reliable;	  	   Reviewed	  key	  data	  management	  systems,	  procedures	  and	  controls	  relating	  to	  the	  collection,	  aggregation	  and	  reporting	  processes	  of	  the	  selected	  performance	  indicators;	  	   Performed	  process	  interviews	  with	  3M’s	  reporting	  team	  and	  subject	  matter	  experts	  to	  verify	  consistency	  in	  the	  management	  approach	  for	  determining	  materiality,	  delegating	  reporting	  tasks	  and	  implementing	  internal	  quality	  control	  procedures;	   Conducted	  investigations	  of	  public	  records	  to	  determine	  legitimacy	  of	  3M’s	  assertions	  regarding	  performance;	   Reviewed	  several	  drafts	  of	  the	  Report	  along	  with	  supporting	  data	  and,	  as	  necessary,	  provided	  recommendations	  on	  discrepancies	  that	  might	  affect	  communication	  to	  stakeholders;	   Reviewed	  3M’s	  approach	  to	  ensuring	  application	  of	  the	  GRI	  G3.1	  Guidelines	  principles	  and	  verified	  alignment	  with	  GRI	  Application	  level	  C+	  requirements.	  	  	  The	  procedures	  selected	  are	  based	  on	  the	  Assurance	  Provider’s	  professional	  judgment.	  Although	  only	  ten	  material	  key	  performance	  indicators	  and	  a	  limited	  set	  of	  profile	  disclosures	  are	  required	  for	  a	  GRI	  C+	  level	  report,	  this	  external	  assurance	  statement
