WORLDCUMMINS SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT  2019-20202
A NOTE FROM  
THE CHAIRMAN
Rather than discuss the accomplishments 
detailed in this report for 2019, I want to  
address the eventful first six months of 2020. 
The deadliest pandemic since 1918, 
immediately followed by the most 
sweeping protests in a half century, 
are forcing businesses to re-examine 
their role in society. Cummins has 
long believed that we serve each of 
our stakeholders best by serving all 
stakeholders. This simple idea has 
been the power behind our company’s 
success for more than 100 years.
Of course, businesses must have the 
financial resources to make that happen, 
especially in difficult times. Cummins 
entered 2020 in a position of strength.  
As we do before each economic 
downturn, the company took actions 
in late 2019 to prepare for weaker markets this year. While these actions 
were independent of the world-changing 
events that followed, they have helped us 
weather the new reality.
The company ended the first quarter 
of this year with $2 billion in cash and 
marketable securities, and access to 
$1.9 billion in committed credit facilities. 
In May, we bolstered our access to 
liquidity by entering into an agreement  
for an additional $2 billion revolving  
credit facility.
These steps, along with our strong 
financial position, enabled the company 
to move quickly to protect the health, 
safety and job security of Cummins employees, while still ensuring we 
supported the critical needs of our 
customers. We also maintained our 
investments in promising technologies,  
potentially critical to the company’s  
future success. 
With seven sites in Wuhan, China, 
Cummins was significantly impacted 
by the virus relatively early. By the 
time COVID-19 was declared a global 
pandemic, the company had established 
processes and procedures to protect 
our employees and communities while 
supporting customers, many carrying out 
essential functions during the pandemic.3
Cummins products support the critical 
needs of our economy and society:
 »Our engines power the trucks 
delivering food, medicine and other 
basic needs; 
 »We power the construction equipment 
building emergency medical facilities 
across the globe; 
 »Cummins generators help keep critical 
facilities such as hospitals and data 
centers running around the clock; and
 »Our service branches keep all of this 
equipment working, day after day.
To support both our customers  
and communities, Cummins made 
keeping employees safe our top priority. 
The majority of our employees who can 
work from home have been doing so for 
more than three months. This allowed us 
to focus resources and investments on 
our engineering and production facilities. 
In those facilities, we have taken many 
steps to protect the health and safety  
of our people, including:
 »Mandatory health screenings at 
Cummins plants and facilities;
 »Personal protective equipment (PPE) 
for frontline employees;
 »Masks required inside open plants  
and facilities; »Redesigned exits, entrances and 
production lines to encourage  
social distancing;
 »Enhanced cleaning protocols  
before, during and after shifts; and
 »Expanded healthcare and leave 
programs to support employees  
and their families.
We also sought to make a difference in 
the communities where Cummins does 
business. The company partnered with 
3M and DuPont to produce PPE for 
medical professionals. The Cummins 
Foundation made targeted grants to 
support children and families impacted 
by COVID-19. And the company 
documented the procedures we used to 
safely reopen and posted them publicly  
in a playbook to help other businesses 
and to promote a broad recovery.
None of this would have been possible 
without the hard work, dedication and 
innovative spirit of our employees, 
managers, leaders and our Board of 
Directors. I am deeply grateful for their 
continuing courage and commitment in 
this challenging environment. 
Now we face another critical challenge. 
Like many, I have been horrified by the 
killings of Black people in the U.S. at the 
hands of authorities entrusted to protect them. The increasing reports of blatant 
acts of racism and the empowerment 
of those with racist views are deeply 
troubling. Systemic racism is a scourge 
that weakens our nation and is a burden 
on all of us that we must remove with 
urgency and resolve.
One of Cummins’ most important 
leaders, CEO J. Irwin Miller, actively 
inserted himself and our company into 
the civil rights movement in the 1960s. 
We will honor this legacy by being  
active again at this important moment. 
At the time of this writing, we are still 
developing the full scope of activities  
but at a minimum we will:
 »Ensure the inclusion of Black people 
and other people of color at all levels  
of the company;
 »Use our voice and influence to 
advocate for social justice;
 »Engage with the criminal justice  
system to promote change; and
 »Support organizations working in 
economic empowerment, education 
and health care in our communities  
to promote equity for Black people  
and people of color.The pandemic and protests 
have revealed a fundamental 
truth about sustainability: 
companies and institutions 
are only as strong as the 
communities, countries 
and the world around them. 
To be successful for our 
shareholders over the long 
run, we must ensure the 
health and prosperity of  
all of our stakeholders.
While I’m proud of the accomplishments 
included in this report, there’s much  
work to be done. You can count on 
Cummins to strive for a more  
prosperous and just world.

Chairman and CEO 
Cummins Inc.
THE 
STAKEHOLDER 
MODEL
Cummins has long 
practiced the stakeholder 
model of corporate 
governance, maintaining 
the best way to serve any 
individual stakeholder is  
by serving the interests  
of all stakeholders.
“We have a responsibility to  
use part of our resources to 
respond to the needs of the 
society which gives us our  
charter,” longtime Cummins 
Chairman CEO J. Irwin Miller  
wrote in the company’s Annual 
Report in 1972. “We can in the 
long run be a healthy company 
only in so far as we exist and  
serve within an economically  
and socially healthy society.”
The model has been embraced  
by Cummins’ leaders ever since.4
CUMMINS  
AND COVID-19
Editor’s Note: While this report focuses on Cummins’ environmental,  
social and governance performance in 2019, the company feels compelled  
to briefly report on the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 in 2020.
The Cummins Sales and Service 
branch in Indianapolis, Indiana (U.S.) 
demonstrates safe behaviors to support 
customers doing essential work.By the time the World Health Organization declared 
COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, Cummins was moving 
quickly to support customers while protecting employees 
and the communities where the company does business.
The company was well aware of the virus 
by then. In early 2020, production began 
slowing at Cummins’ operations in China, 
including the company’s seven plants in 
Wuhan, which went into lockdown on 
Jan. 23 to fight COVID-19. By March, 
conditions began stabilizing in China, but 
the virus started impacting India, Europe 
and North America.
On March 13, just two days after the 
pandemic was declared, Cummins 
offices around-the-world began closing, 
as employees were asked to work from 
home if possible. The majority of the 
company’s manufacturing facilities would 
experience shutdowns of four to six 
weeks. All of Cummins’ operations in 
China were back operational by the end 
of the first quarter, but additional actions 
were necessary to keep the company on 
solid financial footing.  The Board of Directors moved quickly to 
reduce costs while ensuring the company 
supported critical, frontline workers. 
In early April, the board authorized 
temporary pay reductions for itself, the 
CEO and company Vice Presidents.  
The board reduced its pay by 25%, 
the CEO’s salary by 50% and Vice 
Presidents’ pay by 25%. Cummins 
also implemented temporary pay and 
work-hour reductions for exempt and 
office employees around the world 
while preserving pay for many frontline 
manufacturing, Distribution and critical 
research and development employees. 
Cummins took other steps as well, 
establishing a risk assessment team 
to review the latest virus information 
and make decisions consistent with 
the company’s values. The team, led 
by the President and Chief Operating 
Officer, continues meeting regularly on operations, supply chain, health and 
safety and more. The Board of Directors 
also began holding additional “virtual” 
meetings, and by June 1 had met nine 
times in 2020 to carry out its oversight 
responsibilities.
Employees across Cummins did their 
part, too, supporting customers while 
upholding the company’s tradition of 
community engagement. One employee, 
for example, created modeling to help his 
local hospital predict COVID-19 spikes; 
another helped a major childcare provider 
develop a contingency plan enabling it to 
safely remain open when a staff member 
contracted the virus.
There’s no question COVID-19 tested 
Cummins, and the company showed  
its mettle in every possible way. SPECIAL REPORT //5

SUSTAINABILITY  
AT CUMMINS
At Cummins, the company’s 
approach to sustainability aligns 
closely to its mission to make 
people’s lives better by powering 
a more prosperous world. 
A more prosperous world is a world with clean air and water, where businesses  
are partners in weaving a stronger social fabric, and where the benefits of economic 
growth are shared by as many people in as many communities as possible.
The company’s Sustainability Progress Report is organized around three key areas 
in this pursuit: environmental reporting, social reporting and governance/economic 
reporting. Cummins strives to be consistent with the reporting structures established  
by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, the Global Reporting Initiative, and this year,  
for the first time, the company will be formally reporting to the platform established by 
the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).
Cummins strives to achieve the environmental, social and governance disclosures 
suggested by these and other groups. The company also reports regularly on its 
sustainability efforts in The Newsroom on cummins.com.This is the first of the company’s reports 
on sustainability over the next 12 weeks. 
Others include:
2019 CUMMINS  
GRI DATA BOOK
The company is again producing a 
separate posting called Cummins’ 2019 
GRI Data Book. It follows the format 
of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
established by the United Nations to 
develop a consistent way for companies 
to report on their environmental, social 
and economic performance. It will be 
posted in the company’s sustainability 
document repository by the end of July.
2019 CUMMINS  
SASB REPORT
Cummins for the first time will 
produce a report aligned specifically 
to the disclosures in the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 
reporting platform. SASB was 
established in 2011 to provide investors 
with industry-specific sustainability 
information about the companies they 
were considering investing in. This 
report will be posted in the company’s 
sustainability document repository by the 
end of July.2019 CDP
Cummins is committed to sharing its 
CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure 
Project) water and climate filings. The 
CDP was established to help build a 
truly sustainable economy by helping 
cities, companies and investors measure 
and understand their environmental 
impact. The 2019 filings will be posted 
in Cummins’ sustainability document 
repository by the end of August 2020.
OUR DATA

WORLDSUSTAINABILITY AT CUMMINS  
2019-2020
PLANET 2050  Cummins Chairman 
and CEO Tom Linebarger introduced 
a new environmental strategy in 2019 
to address challenges such as climate 
change. It includes specific goals timed 
to 2030 and aspirations for the company 
extending to 2050.ELECTRIFIED POWER  
Transportation officials in Santa Monica, 
California (U.S.), introduced electrified 
power to their transportation system 
in 2019, a GILLIG battery electric bus 
powered by Cummins’ new electrified 
power platform. COMMUNITIES  Cummins employees 
are building stronger communities 
around the world. Here, a joint venture 
employee in China hands out reusable 
bags to young students to promote 
environmentalism.
HYDROGEN  Cummins made a major 
investment in low-carbon hydrogen 
technology in 2019, acquiring hydrogen 
production technologies provider 
Hydrogenics Corporation. The company 
renamed its Electrified Power segment 
New Power to reflect its broader mission.GENDER EQUITY  A Cummins 
employee mentors a student as part  
of the Cummins Powers Women  
initiative to promote gender equality.CLEAN CRUISING  The Clean Cruisers 
demonstrated in 2019 that adventuring 
can be done in a low-carbon way. They 
used Cummins’ diesel crate engines in 
their vehicles, running on biodiesel, and 
planted trees across Central America.9
MATERIALITY
It’s hard to imagine a more 
eventful first six months of 2020.  
As a result, discussions have begun at Cummins 
on ways the company’s materiality matrix should be 
updated to reflect the global COVID-19 pandemic  
and the need to address racial inequities raised  
by protests for social justice.
The company will build on its matrix 
developed in late 2018, working 
with Deloitte to identify issues where 
Cummins has the biggest environmental, 
social and governance/economic impact 
and reporting gaps. 
Cummins and Deloitte interviewed key 
voices in and outside the company, 
including non-governmental organization 
leaders, public officials, customers, 
agencies that rate and rank companies 
on sustainability, as well as company 
leaders and board members. More than 
1,000 Cummins employees were also 
polled on their sustainability priorities.The resulting matrix identified areas 
such as supply chain, customer training 
and satisfaction, and technology and 
innovation as potential opportunities for 
expanded action and reporting attention. 
Those areas are addressed in this  
2019 report.
However, events in the first half of 
2020 put health and safety and 
diversity and inclusion in a new light. 
That will undoubtedly be reflected in 
the company’s revised matrix and its 
sustainability reporting next year.

NEW STRATEGY 
CHARTS PATH TO  
SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
To do its part to address climate change 
and other global environmental challenges, 
Cummins announced in 2019 a new 
environmental sustainability strategy with  
goals timed to 2030, and aspirations for 2050.The company’s new PLANET 2050 
strategy includes science-based goals 
for products and facilities timed to 2030 
that meet the standards adopted by the 
United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change. Science-based goals 
are designed to limit global temperature 
rise to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius 
by the middle of the century. 
PLANET 2050’s longer term aspirations 
include powering customer success 
through carbon neutral technologies  
for products and facilities, designing  
out waste in products and processes, 
and emitting near zero pollution levels  
in local communities.
The new strategy builds on the success 
of goals announced in 2014 and timed 
to 2020 to reduce the company’s energy 
and water use as well as the carbon 
dioxide (CO2) from its products.
CHALLENGING GOALS
Cummins’ eight 2030 goals (page 21) 
are divided into two categories:  
Goals addressing climate change and  
air emissions, and goals for the use  
of natural resources in the most 
sustainable way.Cummins leaders say progress on 
the 2030 goals will be periodically 
evaluated and communicated, including 
consideration of whether more can  
or should be done in line with global 
energy and environmental challenges.
The company’s strategy also includes 
addressing environmental needs in  
the communities where the company’s 
employees live and work and where 
Cummins does business. Those goals 
are under development.
ASPIRATIONS FOR 2050
The strategy’s aspirations are a first for 
the company. The 2050 targets are 
organized around the same categories  
as the 2030 goals and include:
 »Powering customer success using 
carbon neutral technologies that 
address air quality.
 »Wasting nothing through the circular 
economy principles to use less,  
use better and use again. 
 »Having a net positive impact in every 
community where Cummins operates. PLANET 2050 INITIATIVE //

COVID-19’S POTENTIAL IMPACT 
ON 2020 GOAL PROGRESS
Cummins is facing unprecedented challenges as a business because of COVID-19.  
While the company’s sustainability goals are critical to the business, other more  
immediate company priorities might make progress difficult in 2020.
The current environmental sustainability 
plan for the remainder of 2020 – subject 
to potential updates – is to:
 »Continue implementing capital 
projects for energy and water 
efficiency already underway, 
where needed resources are 
not otherwise occupied with 
COVID-19 support activities;
 »Postpone until 2021 capital 
spending for projects not 
already in progress to support 
other business priorities; and 
 »Continue implementing all  
low- and no-cost environmental 
initiatives that don’t conflict 
with any focused COVID-19 
response efforts.Cummins has aggressively  
implemented power-down actions 
to save energy at facilities subject to 
shutdowns during the crisis, although 
there is often some energy use  
necessary for critical functions.
That could result in a net energy savings, 
but other facilities are working different 
shifts and open longer to maintain social 
distancing and implement cleaning 
protocols. This could use more energy 
than if production lines were optimized 
for efficiency.
Waste generation may also increase 
as the company prioritizes the safety 
of Cummins employees and uses 
disposable items such as personal 
protective equipment.The company’s logistics goal, too,  
could suffer if Cummins expedites 
shipping to support customers whose 
products are considered essential  
during the pandemic. The team is 
working to remain as efficient as possible 
while overall volume is down, thus 
affecting the goal calculation.
Finally, the company’s 2020 energy and 
water intensity goals will be impacted 
to some extent by the reduction of 
employee hours as a result of workforce 
actions announced in late 2019 and early 
2020. Both goals are measured as a 
percentage of employee hours worked. 
Cummins is continuing to track 
performance, but the company may  
not have a full grasp on COVID-19’s 
impact on its 2020 environmental  
goals until early 2021, when results  
are compiled on 2020 performance.
The company will transparently report its 
results as always, looking ahead to the 
challenges and opportunities presented 
by Cummins’ next set of goals for 2030.

CUMMINS PUSHES TO MEET 
2020 ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS
Six years after announcing its first global environmental 
sustainability plan, Cummins has achieved three of seven  
numeric goals and is very close to a fourth, while significantly 
offsetting the electricity it uses with renewable energy.
Cummins continued to exceed  
the carbon dioxide (CO2) savings it 
expected to achieve by 2020 through 
partnering with customers on fuel 
economy projects, avoiding 17 million 
metric tons of CO2.
The company has also surpassed its 2020 
water reduction target, a goal that was 
increased just a few years after Cummins’ 
global environmental sustainability plan 
was announced in 2014.The 2019 year-end energy intensity 
performance was just one percentage 
point shy of the company’s 32% goal. 
The company, however, acknowledges 
there could be challenges to meeting its 
target (page 22) by the end of 2020. 
Cummins also made a significant step 
forward in its goal to use and promote 
renewable sources of energy. A northwest 
Indiana (U.S.) wind farm expansion the 
company is supporting through a virtual 
power purchase agreement completed  
its first full year of operation in 2019. 
While the power generated by the 
expansion doesn’t go directly to 
Cummins, the company’s share  
of the expansion is now producing  
nearly as much electricity as Cummins uses at its facilities in its headquarters 
state of Indiana.
The company also exceeded its goal to 
certify 40 of Cummins’ highest energy 
use facilities to the ISO 50001 Standard, 
which makes efficiency part of the 
company’s everyday operations. 
In addition to the complications from 
COVID-19, external challenges remain 
to achieving every 2020 goal, especially 
in the area of waste management. The 
company is calling on the creativity and 
hard work of its employees to surmount 
these remaining obstacles, if possible. 
A goal-by-goal update on Cummins’ 
progress in 2019 starts on the  
following page.
The Cummins’ engine plant at  
Rocky Mount, North Carolina (U.S.),  
has a state-of-the-art water treatment

in a greenhouse to increase the  
amount of water that can be reused.2020 GOAL PROGRESS //24
ENERGY AND GHG
Achieve a 32% energy 
intensity reduction from 
company facilities  
by 2020 and increase  
the portion of electricity 
Cummins uses derived  
from renewable sources.ENERGY 
STRATEGY
Cummins continues to use 
a facility investment plan 
approach. This approach 
includes a comprehensive 
array of energy efficient and 
renewable energy technologies, 
such as compressed air 
optimization, test cell energy 
recovery, on-site solar,  
LED lighting and advanced 
machine controls. 
Aggregated savings from  
energy efficiency efforts total 
about $62 million per year.
Cummins uses tools and 
resources available from 
programs such as ISO 50001, 
the international energy 
management system standard, 
and the U.S. Department of 
Energy’s Superior Energy 
Performance (SEP) program.ENERGY

31%Cummins invested $30 million, double 
its typical annual amount, in 140 energy 
efficiency and renewable energy projects 
during 2019 toward achieving its energy 
and greenhouse gas (GHG) goals.  
Cost savings are projected to be  
about $5.2 million per year. 
Absolute energy use steadily decreased 
during 2019 for the first time since the 
company began actively tracking it in 
2006. Rolling four quarter energy use  
fell 3% from the last quarter of 2018,  
the highest absolute quarter of energy 
use at the company. 
At the end of 2019, Cummins’ energy 
intensity reduction of 31% was just  
short of its 32% goal, impacted by a  
9% decline in hours worked measured 
from mid-year to end of year. Since 
Cummins’ goal is an intensity goal,  a decline in hours worked must be  
offset by even greater reductions in 
energy use. Total energy costs in 2019 
were approximately $150 million or  
about 7% of Cummins’ net income. 
A global campaign for LED lighting  
during the year produced impressive 
results; about 85% of the company’s  
light fixtures are now LED. 
In 2016, the company pledged to  
have 90% of its facility GHG footprint,  
or 40 sites, certified to the ISO  
energy management standard 50001.  
By the end of 2019, the company had 
surpassed the goal, reaching 44 sites. 
Between 2010 and 2019, the company’s 
energy efficiency and renewable energy 
efforts reduced Cummins’ GHG intensity 
by 42%.The company’s GHG emissions 
decreased by about 56,000 metric  
tons on an absolute basis in 2019  
and fell 7.2% adjusted for hours  
worked compared to the prior year.
Approximately 38,000 metric tons  
of the overall GHG reduction can  
be attributed to the use of updated 
emission factors from the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency,

CUMMINS EXPANDS  
USE OF RENEWABLES
Cummins has made a major commitment  
to renewable energy, pursuing both solar  
and wind projects in 2019.
SOLAR HEATING UP
The company had 25 onsite solar 
photovoltaic (PV) system installations  
in operation in 2019, with a total 
generation capacity of 16.9 MW.  
Nine new solar PV projects were  
added in India, alone, where solar 
intensity is high, and power from the  
grid is carbon-intensive and expensive. 
Cummins has 11 total solar installations 
in India, with three more expected to be 
complete in 2020. The company has a 
total solar capacity of 10 MW in India, 
providing about 9% of the total electricity 
Cummins uses in the country.“Our campaign approach helped us 
to get the benefits of economies of 
scale and deliver significant value to the 
business and environment,” said Ajay 
Vaidya, India ABO Facilities Leader.
In China, the Beijing Foton Cummins 
Engine Company in 2019 expanded 
the largest solar array in the company, 
adding panels to a second building that, 
thanks to technology advances, will 
produce nearly as much power as the 
original 650,000 square foot array built  
in 2016. That array generates about  
15% of the building’s electricity needs. Meanwhile, Cummins Juarez,  
a Components facility in Juarez,  
Mexico, expanded its solar array,  
adding 172 kWp of renewable power.
HARNESSING WIND POWER 
Since it went online in mid-December 
2018 to end of 2019, the Meadow  
Lake VI wind farm in northwest Indiana 
(U.S.) generated enough renewable 
energy to offset 15.7% of Cummins 
global facilities’ carbon footprint.  
The expansion was made possible 
through Cummins’ 15-year virtual  
power purchase agreement (VPPA)  
for 75 MW capacity signed in 2017. 
Renewable energy credits (RECs) from 
the project totaled 126,774 metric tons  
of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent), 
which will directly come off Cummins’ 
GHG footprint. Cummins will retire 
the RECs. The VPPA provided the 
anticipated hedge effect against energy 
prices, as a slight price settlement loss 
was offset by reduced utility costs at  
the company’s Indiana plants.
A LOOK AT SOLAR Cummins has solar  
arrays around the world. 
Here’s three examples:

Reduce direct water use 
across Cummins by 50% 
by 2020, adjusted for hours 
worked. Achieve water 
neutrality at 15 Cummins 
manufacturing, technical, 
and other larger sites 
located in regions where 
water is in short supply.WATER 
STRATEGY
The goals of Cummins’ 
comprehensive water strategy, 
which addresses both direct-water 
use and community engagement, 
are to mitigate business risk, to be 
a good global citizen and to reduce 
costs and compliance risk. 
These goals are consistent with 
the core commitments of the CEO 
Water Mandate, which Cummins 
joined in 2019. The U.N. Global 
Compact’s commitment initiative 
mobilizes business leaders on water, 
sanitation and the U.N.’s Sustainable 
Development Goals.
Endorsers of the CEO Water 
Mandate commit to continuous 
progress against six core elements 
of stewardship and, in so doing, 
understand and manage their own 
water risks. The mandate’s six 
commitment areas: 
 »Direct operations
 »Supply chain and  
watershed management
 »Collective action
 »Public policy
 »Community engagement
 »TransparencyCummins met or exceeded both  
of its 2020 water goals in 2019.  
The company hit its water use intensity 
(water use adjusted for hours worked) 
reduction target of 50% in 2018,  
and surpassed that in 2019,  
achieving a 54% reduction.
Cummins used 895 million gallons 
of water in 2019, a 54 million gallon 
decrease from 2018 and a 77 million 
gallon decrease since the company 
initiated its water strategy in 2014.  
The 54 million gallon decrease  
between 2019 and 2018 was the  
single biggest drop in direct water 
consumption since 2013.Since the goal’s baseline year of 2010, 
direct water use is down by 21%,  
even with an increase in the number  
of facilities during that time period. 
Much of Cummins’ water efficiency 
improvements in facilities to meet its 
2020 goal have been achieved through 
low- and no-cost efforts, notably fixing 
leaks and process optimization. Efforts 
have also involved capital projects, 
primarily equipment efficiency upgrades.
Cummins’ water neutrality efforts have 
also yielded success. Fifteen sites have 
been validated as water neutral toward 
the company’s 2020 goal of 15. These 
locations are off-setting their water use with community improvements  
that either conserve water or make  
new water sources available. 
Examples include initiatives in villages 
near the company’s campus in Phaltan, 
India, where Cummins employees have 
worked with village residents for many 
years to establish water supplies that 
make the villages less vulnerable to 
periods of drought. 
Water neutral sites must be  
re-evaluated every year to count  
toward goal achievement.

2020 GOAL PROGRESS //27
Cummins recycled 91% of the total 
waste it generated in 2019, a modest 
rate increase over the previous year. 
Advances in returnable and re-
useable packaging, while good for the 
environment, are making achieving the 
2020 recycling goal of 95% a challenge.
The overall picture, however, is 
impressive. Since the baseline year of 
2010, Cummins’ total waste disposal 
decreased about 10.6% in absolute 
terms, while experiencing a 47.2% 
reduction in disposal adjusted for hours 
worked. Compared with 2018, Cummins’ 
total waste disposed in 2019 decreased 
by 3,641 metric tons or 15.4% on an 
absolute basis and by 15.7% adjusted 
for hours worked. 
In 2019, the company implemented 
several high-impact projects including 
co-generation and energy recovery 
for energy rich but difficult to recycle 
material. Challenges remain, including 
regulatory barriers and the absence of 
recycling or recovery suppliers in some 
regions of the world.
Cummins has been reducing packaging 
waste globally by increasing its use of 
returnable and reusable packaging.  
Last year, the company completed more 
than 100 packaging projects resulting in the removal of 30 million pounds  
(13,500 metric tons) of packaging waste. 
This positive waste reduction, however, 
negatively impacts the recycling rate,  
as most corrugated and wood packaging 
is widely recycled in many operating 
regions of the world. 
Cummins’ second waste goal is 30 “Zero 
Disposal” sites by the end of 2020. 
There are currently 23 sites pending final 
validation. The company has a stringent 
validation process to certify a site. 
Under Cummins’ definition of Zero 
Disposal, waste can only be burned as 
a last resort to create energy and then 
only if there’s a net energy gain, creating 
more energy than is needed to sustain 
combustion. Each validated site must  
be re-evaluated every year to count 
toward goal achievement. WASTE
Increase company  
recycling rate to 95%  
by 2020. Reach “zero 
disposal” status at  
30 sites with 100 or more 
people by 2020 where  
100% of waste is reused, 
recycled or recovered  
in a useful manner.WASTE 
STRATEGY
The company follows the 
principles of the waste 
management hierarchy of 
reduce, reuse, recycle and 
recovery. The “nothing  
wasted” aspiration of the  
new sustainability strategy 
PLANET 2050 will challenge 
Cummins to minimize waste 
generation at the outset and 
more fully repurpose the  
waste that is generated through 
circular economy principles.
Reducing the company’s  
waste as business grows will 
require a cross-functional 
approach, including 
product design, packaging, 
manufacturing, supply chain, 
services and company-wide 
employee engagement. HAZARDOUS 
WASTE
Cummins is committed to 
avoiding the generation of 
hazardous waste and properly 
handling hazardous materials in 
the workplace, but the definition 
of what constitutes hazardous 
waste varies widely by country. 
The company follows all 
applicable local and regional 
regulations. For U.S. sites that 
generate hazardous waste,  
the company has a formal 
supplier pre-qualification 
process to ensure such  
waste is handled properly.

Partner with customers  
to improve the efficiency 
of our products in use, 
reaching by 2020 an  
annual run-rate reduction  
of 3.5 million metric  
tons (MMT) of carbon 
dioxide (CO2). From optimizing products for specific 
market segments, to the use of software 
to assist in the truck specification 
process, to the ability to customize 
electronic engine settings and 
parameters, Cummins helps customers 
reduce their carbon footprint throughout 
the life of the company’s products.
In 2019, Cummins maintained its annual 
run rate reduction of 4.3 million metric 
tons, which it achieved in 2018 when 
Cummins surpassed the company’s 2020 goal of 3.5 million metric tons.  
Cummins’ fuel economy teams 
throughout the world continue  
to implement new products-in-use 
projects, with more than 300 total 
projects since 2014. 
Global fuel economy teams have been 
building functional capability via fuel 
economy forums, training and tools. 
Cummins estimates that the lifetime 
emissions of its products sold in 2019  
is 925 million metric tons of CO2.   The company’s data is modeled using 
overall volumes by segment and engine 
model sold in a given year, and by 
determining the volumes in operation 
each year using the long-standing 
Cummins New and ReCon Parts 
proprietary parts consumption model as 
well as customer engineering analysis.

CUMMINS  
LOW CARBON 
MINDSET 
Cummins has 
demonstrated its ability to 
think creatively to reduce 
its carbon footprint. 
Here are three ways 
the company is putting 
renewable power to use.
NEW POWER
Cummins is putting more focus on 
battery-electric and fuel cell powered 
(including hydrogen) platforms. 
Cummins has greatly expanded its 
technical capability with electrified 
power technology, offering electrified 
powertrains for school bus, transit  
bus and work truck applications. 
SOLAR
Cummins is making a major 
investment in solar, projecting  
it will have more than two dozen  
onsite solar projects completed  
by the end of 2020.
WIND
The company helped an Indiana 
(U.S.) wind farm expand, offsetting 
nearly all the energy the company 
uses at its Indiana facilities.Like most global companies, Cummins 
relies on various modes of transportation 
to move materials and product between 
plants, warehouses and distributors 
before it ultimately gets to customers.
The challenge is managing the supply 
chain to move freight fast and efficiently. 
Cummins is working to reduce its  
carbon footprint by measuring, 
benchmarking and reviewing the 
company’s freight network and 
strategically making better choices.The logistics management team, with 
data from every shipment, launched a Six 
Sigma project in 2019 to correlate factors 
most impacting CO2 levels. Working with 
Transplace, Cummins third-party logistics 
partner, the company is optimizing 
Cummins-managed freight daily, making 
the company’s top 30 highest CO2 
generating routes a priority.
In 2019, the company was able to 
increase average truckload weights  
by 5.4% over 2018, and decrease  
CO2 emissions per kilogram by 7%, 
making progress on the company’s  
2020 goal of 10%.
The largest CO2 improvement came 
when some import shipments for the 
Cummins’ engine plant in North Carolina 
were switched to entry from the U.S. 
East Coast rather than the West Coast. 
The current focus is on shifting some 
shipments to efficient rail transportation.LOGISTICS

ADVOCACY, PARTNERSHIPS 
CRITICAL TO PROGRESS
Cummins’ policy advocacy and partnerships play key roles  
in the company’s environmental strategy and compliance.
By advocating for tough, 
clear and enforceable 
regulations, and working 
with others to develop 
new technologies to meet them, 
Cummins achieves four strategic goals:
 »Technology development.
 »Incentives to accelerate progress.
 »A balanced, global regulatory approach.
 »Responsible regulations.
Cummins believes strongly it has a 
technical advantage when everyone  
must meet the same standards.
PROMOTING REGULATIONS
Emissions regulations are expected 
to continue tightening globally with a 
growing focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) 
standards. Over the next five years, Brazil, 
China, India, Mexico and other countries 
are expected to adopt the low emissions  
levels contained in the Euro VI and U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
2010 emissions regulations for on-
highway products.
Meanwhile, Phase 2 of the U.S. GHG/
fuel efficiency regulations passed in 
2016 include separate engine standards. 
Cummins continues to support this 
regulation and in 2017 began working 
to implement it in its products. The first 
phase goes into effect in 2021.
Through its Government Relations function 
(see page 53) and by other means,  
the company is advocating for separate 
engine standards around the world as 
other regions consider GHG regulations.
Cummins also continues working to 
lower levels of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) 
and particulate matter in its product 
emissions in the U.S. and globally. The 
company is committed to working with 
the U.S. EPA and the California (U.S.)  Air Resources Board as they develop 
new regulations to reduce NOx emissions 
for on-highway engines.
TRACKING COMPLIANCE 
Keeping track of global standards is no 
small job. In 2019, the company certified 
or maintained more than 140 engine 
configurations with approximately  
17 governing agencies around the world. 
These certifications represent at least 34 
different emissions standards for diesel 
and natural gas products for on-highway, 
off-highway, marine and rail applications.
In 2019, Cummins recreated the Product 
Compliance and Regulatory Affairs 
function to strengthen its collaboration 
with agencies setting emissions 
regulations and certification processes. 
The group functions independently 
from, and provides oversight to, product 
development teams and business segments at Cummins, reporting  
directly to the CEO.
For facility compliance, the company 
recently implemented its global Legal 
Compliance External Audit Program, 
which requires each of Cummins’ 
regional groups around the world to 
select an external vendor to conduct 
compliance audits at their sites.
This program has a common audit 
methodology to drive effective, 
transparent and consistent compliance 
assessment across regions. Cummins 
also uses legal compliance software to 
help ensure full knowledge of compliance 
obligations and track any issues.
PARTNERING FOR PROGRESS
Cummins is a member of many 
organizations that promote sustainability 
and low-carbon technology. They 
include the global Hydrogen Council, 
the U.S. Fuel Cell Hydrogen Energy 
Association, the California Hydrogen 
Business Council, the CA Fuel Cell 
Partnership and Hydrogen Europe. 
CEO Tom Linebarger sits on the board  
of the Hydrogen Council. 
Cummins also participates in the U.S. 
EPA’s Green Power Partnership to 
promote the voluntary use of low carbon 
power sources such as renewable energy.The company is active in the Diesel 
Technology Forum, which raises 
awareness about the importance of  
clean diesel technology.
The Health Effects Institute was  
founded by the U.S. EPA and industry 
leaders, including Cummins, to provide 
impartial, high quality, scientific findings 
on air pollution.
Cummins belongs to BSR, which works 
with members to develop sustainable 
business strategies through research  
and cross-sector collaboration.
The Renewable Energy Buyer’s 
Association, a member-based platform 
that includes Cummins, works to 
streamline and accelerate corporate 
procurement of off-site, utility-scale  
wind and solar energy.
Cummins also belongs to the 
International Council on Clean 
Transportation (ICCT), whose 
mission is to improve the environmental 
performance of road, marine and air 
transportation to benefit public health 
and mitigate climate change. In 2018, 
Cummins produced 31,864 soot-free 
engines as part of a key ICCT initiative. PARTNERSHIPS //

Cummins, through the Cummins  
Foundation and by other means, financially 
supports community engagement projects 
around the world. In 2019, the company 
gave $20.5 million to communities through 
Community Development Grants and other 
strategic community investments in  
Cummins’ three global priority areas.
Here’s a look at 2019 grant-making  
by priority area. ENGAGEMENT
One of the company’s chief metrics  
for community engagement is employee 
participation in Cummins’ Every Employee 
Every Community program, which enables 
each employee to use at least four work  
hours to engage in their communities.  
For the fourth year in a row, more than  
80% of Cummins employees participated  
in the program. In 2019, the company 
increased its participation goal from 70% 
to 80%, but health and safety measures 
implemented due to COVID-19 will make  
the goal difficult to achieve in 2020.IMPACT

ENGINEERING 
SOLUTIONS TO 
GENDER INEQUALITY
In 2018, Cummins launched Cummins 
Powers Women, its $11 million  
(and growing) global grant commitment  
to advancing women and girls in 
communities around the world. 
The program currently 
works with eight global 
nonprofit partners to 
accelerate gender 
equality through 
leadership training, 
advocacy, mentoring, 
financial inclusion, 
entrepreneurship and strategic 
engagement with nonprofit leaders. 
Leaders like Oyeyemi Pitan, who 
graduated from the advocacy and 
leadership accelerator workshop in 
Nigeria led by Rise Up, one of Cummins 
Powers Women’s nonprofit partners. Pitan was already developing national 
programs for women and girls before  
she participated in the workshop. 
She saw girls in her region struggling 
to attend or finish school and getting 
married before they were ready.  
At the workshop, she learned the 
importance of including law- and 
policy-makers in strategic and effective 
advocacy. As a result, she is focusing her 
work on the passage of a national level 
gender and equal opportunity bill, which 
aims to reduce gender discrimination, 
protect women’s rights and increase

women’s opportunities in both public  
and private spaces across Nigeria.
The Cummins Powers 
Women program has seen 
great success in just two 
years. It has served more 
than 100,000 people, 
invested in 74 advocacy 
initiatives in six regions,  
and resulted in eight new 
and improved laws and 
policies supporting  
gender equality. The partnership is a continuation  
of the company’s commitment to 
diversity and inclusion and ensuring  
its global workforce is reflective of  
the communities in which it operates.
In 2019, Cummins leaders around  
the world put their skills to good use  
by engaging directly with Cummins 
Powers Women nonprofit partners  
to further their work and initiatives. 
The Cummins Asia Pacific leadership 
team, for example, gathered in 
Melbourne, Australia, to participate  
in a skills-based workshop with  
eight senior leaders from international humanitarian organizations and Cummins 
Powers Women partner CARE, which 
works around the globe to save lives,  
defeat poverty and achieve social justice.  
Led by a Cummins Six Sigma Black 
Belt, the group discussed the four most 
pressing issues facing CARE. Cummins 
leaders offered their business acumen 
and experience to help formulate plans 
to address each of the challenges and 
provided CARE with tools to improve its 
capacity and partnership opportunities. 
In London, Cummins Government 
Relations Director Laura Gilmore led a 
webinar on basic lobbying and advocacy 
skills for Cummins Powers Women 
partner Rosa, a charitable fund designed 
to support small organizations across  
the U.K. that benefit women and  
girls. More than 30 participants from 
Rosa’s grantees attended the webinar  
to learn how best to communicate 
with local and national government 
stakeholders. With the help of Gilmore’s 
expertise, the grantees learned how  
to build good relationships with 
government stakeholders to further  
their organizations’ goals.100,000

webpage which goes 
into greater depth on 
TEC and the philosophy 
behind it. Cummins has 
also produced a video 
on a graduate in the

LIVES THROUGH  
TECHNICAL EDUCATIONStrong educational systems, improved 
access to industry-relevant skills training 
and decent work make the communities  
in which Cummins employees live and  
work healthier and stronger. This is  
good for Cummins, other businesses  
and communities.
At the same time, jobs 
that do not require skills 
are disappearing and 
there are rising levels 
of unemployment and 
poverty in the ranks of the 
unskilled and uneducated, 
causing individual and 
community hardship. 
Communities around the world are 
suffering from widening gaps in wages 
and incomes due in part to skill set 
disparities. Launched in 2012 to address 
this need, Cummins TEC: Technical 
Education for Communities is the first 
global strategic community program 
developed by Cummins from the ground 
up. The program seeks to create 
educational change in the company’s global communities by equipping 
disadvantaged youth with the technical 
skills that lead to decent work. 
Cummins TEC provides skills 
development and a pathway into 
the prospering economy through a 
Cummins-supported curriculum, teacher 
training, career counseling support, and 
workplace and classroom learning.  
 
The program’s success depends 
on effective partnerships with other 
local hiring and training employers, 
government and community 
organizations. A coalition of more than 
50 partners helps guide the schools and 
provide workplace learning opportunities 
to ensure student outcomes align with 
community needs.

The impact of Cummins TEC is tracked 
through identified program metrics and 
student outcomes, which show how 
Cummins TEC improves the lives of 
students and their families. For example, 
graduates of the program receive wages 
that far exceed average living wages in 
Australia, China, Latin America, Europe, 
India, Africa and the Middle East.  
At the same time, the program’s 
spending per graduate decreased  
by 93% from 2015 to 2019.
“I often see that our 
technical jobs are one of 
the places many people 
can access to gain a good 
paying job to support their 
families,” said Cummins 
Chairman and CEO Tom 
Linebarger. “Our Technical 
Education for Communities 
program goes beyond 
training to provide a 
pathway into the economy 
that doesn’t already exist.”
In 2019, two new Cummins TEC sites 
were launched, bringing the total number 
to 24 in 14 countries. One of the new 
sites, in Onitsha, Nigeria, will be the 
first co-ed TEC school in the country. Engaging more female students in 
Cummins TEC programs around the 
world is a challenge many sites are 
working to improve. 
The program in Shiyan, China, 
implemented a pilot process in 2019 
to increase female enrollment, resulting 
in 10 young women enrolling. This is 
the first female group of students since 
the program launched there in 2016. 
Increasing female enrollment remains a 
key focus for the program in 2020.
Amina Saaidi is a 2018 graduate of the 
Cummins TEC program in Morocco. She 
credits the program for providing her with 
basic foundational skills and hands-on 
learning, such as engine fundamentals 
and how to install engine components. 
Upon graduation, she joined Cummins 
Maroc, where she continued to hone 
her technical skills. She learned about 
different Cummins engines (mechanical 
and electronic), new technology systems 
and how to troubleshoot for repairs. 
“Being in the workshop and field service, 
doing inspections or installing parts 
and assembly, improved many skills for 
me, such as my technical knowledge, 
self-confidence, communication and 
teamwork,” Saaidi said.

POWERING A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD
Cummins is committed to being world 
class in health and safety. The company 
recorded improvements in most key  
metrics in 2019, including:
 »An 8% IMPROVEMENT in Cummins’ 
Incidence Rate, the rate of recordable 
injuries, from 0.646 in 2018 to 0.593 
in 2019 – the lowest Incidence Rate 
since 2015.
 »An 18% IMPROVEMENT in the Severity 
Lost Workday Rate, the rate of lost 
work days, from 7.706 to 6.357.
 »A 15% IMPROVEMENT in the Severity 
Case Rate, the rate of lost or restricted 
work days, from 0.264 to 0.225.
 »A 31% IMPROVEMENT in the Contractor 
Incidence Rate, the rate of recordable 
injuries involving contractors, from 
0.768 to 0.528.
Most importantly, there were no 
employee fatalities in 2019.BEHIND THE NUMBERS
The improvements occurred across 
multiple regions. Cummins in China,  
for example, saw a 31% improvement 
in its Incidence Rate. Latin America 
recorded a 31% improvement in Lost 
Workday cases. Asia-Pacific reduced 
Lost Workdays by 36%. 
Meanwhile, the Cummins Global  
Health and Safety team accomplished 
several major initiatives in 2019 that 
quickly began paying dividends. 
The function, for example, reorganized  
its operating model to a more  
regionally based approach, streamlining 
communication and reducing reaction 
time to critical challenges.The reorganization played a critical role in 
Cummins’ rapid response to COVID-19 
in early 2020, as the Global Health 
and Safety team delivered vital health 
information throughout the organization. 
Subject matter experts were able to 
respond quickly to employee questions 
and process the latest information as it 
became available from health and safety 
experts around-the-world.
BRINGING HSE TOGETHER
Cummins in 2019 also worked to 
truly integrate Health, Safety and the 
Environment (HSE), which for many  
years have been included together 
within the industry but mostly pursued 
separately. For the first time at Cummins, 
HSE objectives and targets were 
introduced in one 2020 plan, providing 
HSE employees with clear priorities as 
the company strives to quickly address 
the needs at every site.
While 2019 will go down as an 
outstanding year for health and safety, 
the company is committed to continuous 
improvement. Protecting Cummins’ 
greatest asset, its employees, is a  
job never truly done.HEALTH AND SAFETY // 
GOALS  
FOR 2023
Cummins believes  
progress can be driven  
by setting aggressive,

REDUCE ERGONOMIC INJURIES
Cummins continued to make progress on reducing  
ergonomic injuries in 2019, recording a 15% improvement  
in the company’s Ergonomic Incidence Rate and setting  
a record for participation in the 8th annual Cummins  
Ergo Cup competition.
The rate is the number of employees per 100 who experienced an  
ergonomic OSHA-recordable injury. The rate declined to 0.127 in 2019,  
as the company completed more than 5,000 new ergonomic job  
assessments and implemented over 2,000 job improvements.
A record 80 sites participated in the 2019 Ergo Cup competition,  
submitting more than 150 improvements totaling over $3 million in  
productivity savings and $12 million in estimated cost avoidance.
Two projects took top honors in the competition. Cummins employees  
in China won the Engineering Award for redesigning testing to re-position  
an exhaust pipe remotely, improving safety while reducing the time  
necessary to complete the task.
Cummins employees in Huddersfield, U.K., meanwhile, won the  
Judge’s Choice Award for developing a semi-automatic crane that  
eliminates manually lifting a turbocharger core into position.HEALTH AND SAFETY // 41
DIVERSITY AND  
INCLUSION PLAY  
KEY ROLES IN 
SUSTAINABILITY
Diversity and inclusion are critical  
to Cummins’ ability to innovate,  
to win in the marketplace and  
to create sustainable success.
Cummins employees come from different 
backgrounds and experiences and 
aspire to work in an environment that 
is representative at every level of the 
communities in which Cummins operates 
around the world. They are each unique 
in their perspectives and passions.
Employees have varied experiences  
and personal motivations that drive  
them. They are united in their relentless 
desire to see a world, a workplace,  a team where all people are  
embraced for who they are and  
what they aspire to achieve.
At Cummins, diversity and inclusion is a 
business imperative. Having diverse and 
inclusive workplaces allows Cummins to 
attract and retain a truly global workforce. 
Diversity and inclusion enable Cummins 
to bring the right combination of 
perspectives, insights and skills to solve 
the challenges of today and tomorrow.
Cummins has put an emphasis on 
diversity and inclusion for nearly  
50 years. It is one of the company’s 
five official values today.DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION // 42

to diversity and inclusion, the company 
takes proactive measures to review talent 
management and accountability systems  
and processes to mitigate bias and 
ensure the equitable acquisition and 
advancement of all talent. 
To ensure Cummins has an integrated, 
sustainable and global approach to 
diversity and inclusion, the company 
established the Global Diversity and 
Inclusion Strategy team in 2019.  
The team is developing a global  
diversity and inclusion strategy  
to realize this vision. 
The strategy will include a global 
learning and development curriculum 
designed to increase awareness and 
enhance employee competency by 
encouraging employees to be conscious 
of their privilege, filters, bias and cultural 
preferences. The team is also moving 
forward on Cummins’ U.S. Diversity 
Growth Initiative focused on Black 
and Latinx talent. 
The company is also working to attract 
and retain more women globally and 
has put a special focus on people with 
disabilities through its Disability Inclusion 
Initiative. Cummins employees have  
 volunteered more than 11,000 hours 
toward disability inclusion community 
projects, and the company is examining 
the readiness of its own facilities and 
technology. Cummins is establishing 
partnerships to improve the hiring of 
people with disabilities. 
Late in 2019, Cummins Chairman 
and CEO Tom Linebarger encouraged 
employees to see diversity and  
inclusion as an opportunity for growth. 
He also talked about an important item 
before the company’s leaders: updating 
Cummins’ Business Case for Diversity. 
The Business Case for Diversity is 
Cummins’ commitment to achieving  
a diverse and inclusive workforce.
“Our ability to attract talent 
of all types and engage and 
include them in solving our 
most complicated problems 
will determine our success 
as a company,” Linebarger 
said. “It’s just that simple.  
If we are able to do that 
better than the competition, 
we win.” LEADERSHIP
Cummins offers training and mentoring programs  
to increase the pool of potential women leaders.  
The Cummins Executive and Leadership teams 
consist of senior leaders focusing on strategy  
and operations, respectively. SUPERVISORS

GLOBAL DIVERSITY PROCUREMENT 
Cummins believes using diverse suppliers enables the  
company to tap into the power of diverse thoughts and  
approaches, increases competition for Cummins’ business  
and spreads the many benefits of economic growth to a larger  
number of communities. Cummins is a member of the Billion  
Dollar Roundtable, a select group of companies consistently  
doing at least $1 billion in annual business with diverse suppliers. 
Cummins reached a new high in supplier diversity in 2018, surpassing $2 billion in global spending with  
suppliers who self-identify as diverse in their region of the world. Spending dipped in 2019 as business  
slowed in several key markets, but remained well above $1 billion.

their individual business segment or site, 
or mandatory safety and ethics training. 
The company puts a major emphasis 
on leadership training to both prepare 
employees for advancement and to 
create a better work experience for all

program. Additional benefits vary 
between locations and include options 
such as 401(k) Retirement Savings Plans; 
medical, dental and life insurance; flexible 
spending accounts; pension plans and 
employee stock purchase plans. 
PARENTAL LEAVE
Cummins introduced a new U.S.  
parental leave policy in 2018. In general, 
the policy provides eligible employees  
up to 12 weeks of fully paid leave to 
primary caregivers and up to six weeks  
of fully paid leave to secondary caregivers 
following the birth, adoption or placement 
of a foster child/children.
This is in addition to disability  
leave, which is intended to provide  
a medical recovery period for women 
following the birth of a child. Cummins 
recognizes that bringing a new child  
into the family can be both wonderful  
and challenging. Cummins is focused  
on supporting employees during this  
very important time.

GOVERNANCE / 
ECONOMIC
Cummins believes governance and  
economic performance are fundamental to 
sustainability. Without both, it’s difficult for  
a company to succeed over the long term.

GOOD GOVERNANCE PROVIDES 
IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT
The Cummins Board of Directors provides 
vision, strength and stability through sound 
and independent judgment on significant 
issues affecting the company.
The 11-member board includes the 
company’s Chief Executive Officer and  
10 independent directors, consistent  
with the definition established by the 
 U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the New York Stock 
Exchange. Board Member Rich Freeland, 
formerly President and Chief Operating 
Officer at Cummins, retired from the 
company and the board in 2019.
Through its ongoing guidance, the  
Board of Directors protect the interests  
of shareholders. It believes those 
interests are best served by combining 
the roles of chairman and CEO with a 
strong and independent lead director. 
The lead director has many critical duties, 
including conferring with the chairman on, and approving board agendas, as 
well as serving as the chairman of the 
Governance & Nominating Committee.
Cummins is fortunate to have former  
U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexis M. 
Herman serving in this important position.
The Board of Directors provide robust 
oversight through five fully independent 
committees: Audit, Compensation, 
Governance & Nominating; Finance;  
and Safety, Environment & Technology. 
Each director has a background 
particularly relevant to the company’s 
operations and they frequently visit 
Cummins’ locations without the  
CEO present to talk directly with 
managers and employees. Individual directors have visited  
13 different company locations in 
Australia, China, India and the United 
States in just the past two years.  
All the directors attended at least  
75% of the board’s meetings in 2019.
The Board of Directors has worked  
hard to bring fresh viewpoints to its 
work. In just the past five years, four 
new directors were added to the board 
and there have been nine new directors 
since 2009. The board also pursues new 
ideas and approaches through its goal of 
having rotating committee assignments 
every three to five years.
Regular conversations with shareholders 
is another key goal for the board.  
The CEO and at least one board member 
meet routinely with shareholders to 
discuss topics including company 
growth, strategy, and performance on 
environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) matters. In 2019, they reached 
shareholders holding about 30% of the 
company’s outstanding shares.The Board of Directors believe strongly 
in accountability. Shareholders have the 
right to call special meetings if they meet 
a voting power threshold of 10%. They 
also have the right to unilaterally amend 
company by-laws upon a majority vote.
More information on the Board of 
Directors and governance as well as 
executive compensation can be found  
in the 2020 Proxy. The board also plays 
an important role in risk management.

SUSTAINABILITY 
STARTS WITH ETHICS 
AND COMPLIANCE
Cummins believes the sustainability of any company is built on  
a foundation of ethical behavior. Ethics have been an important 
part of company culture at Cummins from its founding in 1919,  
to its 100th anniversary in 2019 and on to today. 
The Ethics and Compliance function  
will play a key role in ensuring that  
culture continues at Cummins for  
the next 100 years.
Company employees worldwide are 
required to comply with Cummins’  
Code of Business Conduct, built around 
10 fundamental principles (see right).  
The Ethics and Compliance team 
reinforces these principles through 
several online training courses,  
ranging from anti-bribery to conflicts  
of interest and fair competition. Cummins also conducts an annual  
Ethics Certification campaign, asking  
employees, including members of  
the company’s Board of Directors, 
to state they are following all key 
compliance policies. As of March 2020, 
33,186 employees had completed the 
2019 certification process. The Ethics 
and Compliance team reviews any 
exceptions and works with Cummins’ 
Human Resources function to document  
and investigate those exceptions.
The Ethics and Compliance team 
promotes a “speak up” culture where 
employees play an active role in promoting and protecting the Code  
of Conduct. Cummins has a strict  
non-retaliation policy protecting 
employees who make reports of  
possible code violations in good faith. 
In 2019, a key focus for the team  
was addressing the findings of a 2018 
survey it conducted with the Ethisphere 
Institute to gauge employee perceptions 
about ethics at Cummins. More than 
16,000 employees participated in the 
survey, which found while there was 
broad recognition of the importance the 
company places on ethical behavior, 
employees’ willingness to report concerns and their knowledge of 
the code varied depending on their 
geographic location and role with  
the company.
The Ethics and Compliance team 
has been working to improve 
communications on ethics, especially  
in those areas of concern raised by  
the survey. Among the steps taken  
has been the development of a tool kit  
to help managers talk about ethics and  
the importance of high ethical standards. 
Managers play a critical role not just 
in communications, but in reinforcing 
policies and setting agendas.
The Ethics and Compliance function  
also formed a cross-functional team in 
2019 to identify and designate select 
corporate policies as Cummins Core 
Policies (CCPs). CCPs are existing key 
global policies that apply to all employees 
and are closely tied with the Code of 
Conduct and Mission, Vision and Values. 
These policies were revised to improve 
clarity, readability and understanding,  
and are more easily accessible to 
employees on the website.
Examples of CCPs include: Anti-Bribery 
and Prohibited Payments Policy, 
Treatment of Each Other at Work Policy, 
Conflicts of Interest Policy and Workplace 
Violence Prevention Policy. ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE // 
CODE OF  
CONDUCT  
PRINCIPLES
Here are the 10 major principles behind 
Cummins’ Code of Business Conduct:
 01 We will follow the law everywhere.
 02 We will embrace diverse 
perspectives and backgrounds, 
and treat people with dignity  
and respect.
 03 We will compete fairly and honestly.
 04 We will avoid conflicts of interest.
 05 We will demand that everything  
we do leads to a cleaner, healthier  
and safer environment.
 06 We will protect our technology,  
our information and our  
intellectual property.
 07 We will demand that our financial 
records are accurate and that  
our reporting processes are  
clear and understandable.
 08 We will strive to improve  
our communities.
 09 We will communicate  
honestly and with integrity.
 10 We will create a culture where  
employees take responsibility  
for ethical behavior.50
ABOUT  
THE POLICY
Here’s a quick look at Cummins’  
Human Rights Policy:
ADOPTION: Completed in December 
2017 after a nearly year long review, 
the policy was officially posted in 
January 2018.
CONTENTS: The policy specifically 
precludes human trafficking and 
exploitation, and forced labor, child 
labor, bonded labor and prison labor, 
and supports foreign and migrant 
worker rights.
IMPACT: The policy applies to Cummins  
entities in which the company has a  
controlling ownership interest or  
management responsibilities, including 
subsidiaries and joint ventures.
INSPIRATION: The policy was guided  
by the Universal Declaration of  
Human Rights, the International 
Labor Organization’s Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at 
Work, the United Nations Global Compact 
and the U.N.’s Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights.
SUPPLIERS: Cummins commits to 
supply chain transparency, pledging 
to work with suppliers and partners 
in high-risk locations to mitigate the 
risk of human trafficking and other 
violations of human rights.HUMAN RIGHTS 
REPORTING
Ethics and Compliance 
has also been working 
to complete reporting on 
human rights required 
by the United Kingdom. 
Companies doing business 
in the country must assess 
suppliers on the risk they 
present from a human  
rights perspective.
Those deemed at highest 
risk must then be subject to 
increased levels of review 
and oversight, including 
signing that they comply 
with Cummins codes of 
conduct. Australia and 
France have passed similar 
legislation. You can see  
the company’s reporting  
at the Transparency in  
Supply Chains page on 
cummins.com.CUMMINS BUILDS ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY
Cummins continued to build on the Human Rights Policy 
adopted in 2017, implementing company-wide training on the 
policy in 2019, and working to fully integrate the new policy into 
company functions with the greatest potential to see violations 
such as child labor and human trafficking.
The policy, which applies to the  
company and its suppliers, prohibits 
numerous forms of compulsory labor as 
well as child labor. Many of its provisions 
were included in Cummins’ Code of 
Business Conduct and the company’s 
Supplier Code of Conduct, but 
Cummins leaders wanted to make it 
abundantly clear where the company 
stands on these important issues.
Ethics and Compliance leaders hope the 
employee training will raise awareness 
about potential policy issues. An 
assessment when the policy was put together found any policy violations were  
most likely to be seen deep in the company’s  
supply chain, perhaps involving the raw 
material that goes into the steel or other 
metals the company uses. Outside 
vendors providing services ranging from 
catering to cleaning have also been 
identified as a potential area to watch.
The Ethics and Compliance team is 
working with the company’s supply chain 
function to integrate the policy in the 
Eyes Open Audits conducted primarily 
by purchasing personnel during supplier 
visits. These audits ask employees to look for worker health and safety 
concerns, worker treatment issues 
and the handling of hazardous and 
combustible materials, in addition  
to contract compliance issues.
The Eyes Open Audits have devoted 
more attention to the issues of child and 
forced labor to ensure alignment with 
requirements in the company’s Supplier 
Code of Conduct. The Human Rights 
Policy offers greater detail on compliance 
requirements. Select employees have 
completed mandatory online training  
on the topic.ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE // 51
CUMMINS  
SUPPLIER CODE  
OF CONDUCT
The Cummins Supplier Code of Conduct 
helps the company ensure it is doing business 
with other companies around the world 
sharing Cummins’ values for sustainable 
practices. It is built around seven principles:
 01 Obey the law everywhere.
 02 Treat people with  
dignity and respect.
 03 Avoid conflicts of interest.
 04 Provide a safe and  
healthy workspace.
 05 Protect Cummins  
technology, information  
and intellectual property.
 06 Protect the environment and  
conserve natural resources.
 07 Assist Cummins in  
enforcing the code.
Cummins requires a verification response 
from suppliers that they are following the 
code before they are added to the company’s 
supplier database. Cummins may visit 
facilities, review documentation and conduct 
audits, if necessary, to ensure compliance.MAINTAINING THE CODE
Training and guidance are not enough to ensure compliance. Cummins relies on  
its employees to speak up if they witness behavior that potentially violates the Business  
Code of Conduct. Employees may report a potential violation through a secure website  
or a toll-free telephone number. Where legally permissible, employees can report  
anonymously if they wish.
Once a potential violation is reported, Cummins has a global team of Master Investigators 
stationed around the world, who investigate alleged Code of Conduct violations.  
In 2019, 2,436 cases were investigated, 47% of those cases were substantiated  
and 41% of the substantiated cases led to terminations.

Thousands of employees complete mandatory ethics training every year  
at Cummins through the Cummins Learning Center. The company is  
changing its reporting this year to look more narrowly at annual participation. 
Training is frequently updated, assigned based on its relevance to particular 
jobs and delivered on a cyclical basis. So, in a single year, training in one  
topic area may be larger or smaller.

CYBER SECURITY  
AND DATA PRIVACY
Cummins takes cyber security and data privacy extremely 
seriously, whether it involves the company’s own intellectual 
property, employee information or the data of Cummins’ 
customers, suppliers, distributors, shareholders,  
job applicants or visitors to the company’s website.
The Ethics and Compliance function leads a cross functional team that 
implements the company’s Data Privacy program. The team includes members 
from Legal, Information Technology, Human Resources and other groups. 
Outside consultants have reviewed the program and Cummins has prepared 
detailed plans to improve compliance. In 2020, a cross-functional team of  
leaders is taking on oversight of the program.
All Cummins personnel, including temporary employees, contractors or  
anyone handling personal data on the company’s behalf are required to follow  
the data protection requirements contained in Cummins’ policies and 
procedures. The company does not sell or share personal information provided 
to Cummins with third parties for their own use. The company retains personal 
information based on legal and business needs, then securely destroys it.
Data protection is part of Cummins’ Code of Business Conduct and Supplier 
Code of Conduct. Mandatory training is part of the company’s compliance 
training. Cummins’ privacy policy, and its E.U. – U.S. Privacy Shield Website 
Privacy Statement, are linked to at multiple locations across the company’s 
external website, including for the company’s Connected Solutions program, 
which uses telematics to improve the performance of customers’ engines,  
and Cummins’ Careers web page.MANAGING RISK EFFECTIVELY
Cummins believes strongly that the most sustainable  
companies manage risk well. 
The Enterprise Risk Management team 
at Cummins works with the company’s 
top leaders to establish a culture where 
key risks are identified and responded 
to appropriately, with guidance and 
oversight from the company’s Board  
of Directors. 
This starts with the Enterprise Risk 
Council, made up of Cummins’ Chief 
Operating Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer, General Counsel, Vice 
President – Corporate Strategy and 
Chief Administrative Officer. They meet 
quarterly with the leader of the Risk 
Management function to review and 
update material risks to the company  
and their mitigation plans.
The most significant risks are each 
assigned to a member of the Cummins 
Leadership Team, who are responsible 
for managing the risk. Those leaders 
make periodic reports to the relevant 
committees of the company’s Board  of Directors. The board and its  
committees provide robust oversight 
of the company’s Enterprise Risk 
Management program, dedicating  
time to this responsibility at every  
regular board meeting.
For example, in 2019, the board engaged 
outside experts to provide education 
on cyber security risks in the industry 
and to complete a review of Cummins’ 
Enterprise Cyber Security program.  
The company provides periodic updates 
to the board on its progress in mitigating 
this important risk.
Cummins, meanwhile, continues work 
on improving the Business Continuity 
Plans at its sites to ensure facilities and 
functions are prepared if something 
happens to the site or a key aspect of its 
supply chain. The Global Security team 
manages the plans, which is a key part 
of the company’s transition to holistic 
emergency management. The company performs tabletop 
exercises at its key sites to ensure they 
are ready if an emergency takes place, 
and their Business Continuity Plans  
are properly focused. The company 
believes this multifaceted approach, 
cascaded down to every location,  
is critical to effective risk and  
emergency management.
A list of potential risks that could  
impact Cummins’ business performance 
is available on page 17 of the  
2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The report is the definitive source for 
financial information about the company. 
Risk management is also covered 
extensively in the 2020 Proxy,  
including on page 12 of the document.RISK MANAGEMENT // 53
PROMOTING THE 
POWER OF CHOICE
The Cummins Government Relations team 
works around the world to support the 
company’s sustainability initiatives and its 
mission of making people’s lives better by 
powering a more prosperous world.
In 2019, the future of energy continued to 
evolve, and the team worked to advocate 
for the adoption of “technology neutral” 
environmental standards and air quality 
goals globally. On Capitol Hill, both Tony Satterthwaite, 
the leader of the Distribution segment 
then and now company President  
and Chief Operating Officer,  
and Wayne Eckerle, Vice President 
of Global Research and Technology, 
testified in front of two separate 
Congressional committees on the future 
of heavy duty transportation. They said 
improving existing technologies and 
investing in new ones would be the  
best way to address climate change  
and improve air quality.
THE PATH FORWARD 
Cummins believes in tough, clear 
and enforceable regulations. It offers 
customers a diverse set of power 
platforms, so they can choose what’s 
best for their particular circumstances. 
Given the advances in clean diesel and 
the infrastructure needs for electrification, 
fuel cells and other new technologies, 
it doesn’t make sense to preclude any 
option now.In China and India,  
the Government Relations 
teams engaged with 
policymakers to ensure 
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) 
and particulate matter (PM) 
standards for conventional 
technologies are fully 
implemented and enforced, 
establishing the rules of the 
road for new technologies. 
These engagements, along 
with additional advocacy by 
the team, is how Cummins 
is using its voice and its 
technology leadership to 
inform governments about 
the policies that will lead to 
a more sustainable future. 
With Cummins’ New Power business 
segment encompassing hydrogen 
generation, fuel cell technology and 
battery electric powertrains, Government 
Relations, along with senior leadership, 
became actively engaged in the 
Hydrogen Council executive committee.This international council has provided a 
platform for the company to collaborate 
with experts and companies with 
a similar vision of the future, and to 
continue promoting the innovative 
technologies Cummins has to offer.
The company’s work with the Hydrogen 
Council educates elected officials in 
Europe, Asia and the U.S. about the 
importance of government investment in 
research and infrastructure to accelerate 
adoption and ensure technologies reach 
their potential for customers. 
TRADE IS KEY
In addition to the work with the New 
Power segment, the Government 
Relations team continued to advocate 
for free trade agreements that support 
Cummins’ global supplier network.
The focus for much of 2019 was on 
the United States-Canada-Mexico 
Agreement (USMCA). The team worked 
to ensure the agreement would allow the 
company to continue as a leader in North 
American manufacturing while enforcing 
key environmental standards to keep all 
three partners accountable for trade’s 
environmental impact. GOVERNMENT RELATIONS // 54
LOBBYING 
Cummins belongs to a number of trade organizations. 
While the company may not agree with these 
associations on every matter, Cummins believes  
they help ensure government leaders know where  
the company stands on key issues.
Here’s a list of U.S. trade organizations paid dues in excess of $50,000 during  
calendar year 2019, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which fell below  
the $50,000 threshold. Listed with each group is an estimate of the portion of dues 
used for lobbying or other political expenditures.POLITICAL  
CONTRIBUTIONS 
In the U.S., political contributions  
are made by the Cummins Inc. Political 
Action Committee (CIPAC) and 
funded solely by voluntary employee 
contributions. CIPAC makes contributions 
to federal and state candidates on  
a bipartisan basis and according to 
federal and state election laws.  
CIPAC is governed by corporate  
policies and bylaws that state: 
 »CIPAC contributions are  
strictly voluntary.
 »Employees will not be  
reimbursed directly or indirectly  
for political contributions. 
 »Employees will not be pressured to 
contribute to CIPAC or make any  
other personal political contribution.
 »Failure to contribute to CIPAC shall not 
disadvantage an employee’s career.CIPAC contributions are based on: 
 »Public integrity of the candidate.
 »Representation of a Cummins  
facility or employees.
 »Support for issues important  
to Cummins.
 »Timely and effective  
constituent service.
 »Political leadership or organization.
 »Support for the company’s values.
All of CIPAC’s activities are disclosed 
to the Cummins Board of Directors in 
an annual political contribution report. 
A complete list of the political action 
committee’s contributions to  
candidates is available here.POLITICAL  
ACTIVITIES
Cummins bans contributions using 
corporate funds to candidates, political 
parties and independent expenditures, 
including advertisements that support  
or oppose individual candidates.
The company also will not use corporate 
funds to contribute to 501 (c) (4) and  
527 tax-exempt groups in the United 
States that are engaged in political 
activity or make payments to influence 
ballot issues, unless the issues are  
directly tied to the company’s core  
values and business interests. 
In those cases, Cummins is committed 
to publicly disclosing any payments 
including recipient names and amounts. 
The company made no such payments 
in 2019.TRADE

INNOVATION TO  
POWER THE WORLD
Clessie Cummins’ improvements to  
the diesel engine were just the first 
examples of innovation at the company  
that bears his name. Since Cummins’ founding in 1919, 
the company has been the leader 
in diesel innovation, adding natural 
gas, electrification, and now exploring 
hydrogen and other technologies to add 
to its broad portfolio of power solutions.
Cummins invested for the first time  
over $1 billion in research, development 
and engineering expenses in 2019,  
and renamed its Electrified Power 
segment New Power to reflect a  
broader mission. The year was filled with firsts. New  
Power unveiled in 2019 a hydrogen-
powered demonstration truck to explore 
that technology. Working in partnership 
with bus manufacturer GILLIG,  
New Power also introduced Cummins’ 
first electrified power platform for buses 
for the transportation system in Santa 
Monica, California (U.S.).
Cummins Power Systems launched 
the HSK78G natural gas generator 
series in 2019 for various applications 
to provide reliable and efficient power, 
while reducing operating costs. The L9N 
Near Zero emissions natural gas engine 
developed by Cummins’ Engine segment 
helped power the public transit system  
in Santiago, Chile, the first application  
for that engine outside the U.S. 
The company also completed in 2019 
its acquisition of fuel cell and hydrogen 
technologies provider Hydrogenics. 
Cummins began developing its fuel cell 
capabilities 20 years ago. The acquisition 
of Hydrogenics will enable the company 
to offer a full, differentiated hydrogen 
solution, from start to finish, seamlessly 
integrated for Cummins customers. The company didn’t simply innovate 
in what it made but in how it made 
products. Cummins, for example, 
produced its first low-volume part  
using 3D printing for the company’s  
New and ReCon Parts function in 2019. 
Cummins also invested in newer  
3D printer technology, which will allow 
the company to print parts that are 
lighter, stronger and more effective than 
parts created using traditional methods 
that employ molds, molten metal and 
equipment to cut and shape parts.
Innovators lead, and Cummins continued 
leading the way in diesel technology in 
2019, launching its 2020 X15 Efficiency 
Series engine for heavy duty trucks  
about a year prior to regulatory 
requirements. The new X15 offers 
improved fuel economy and further 
reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
As Cummins looks to its next 100 years, 
innovation will be critical, whether its 
improving the company’s diesel engines, 
bringing new low-carbon technologies to 
the marketplace or working in new ways 
to use less of the world’s resources.INNOVATION //

EXPANDING CUMMINS’ KNOWLEDGE
Cummins continued to expand its  
knowledge base in part through  
highly targeted acquisitions.
In 2019, the company completed its acquisition of fuel cell and hydr ogen 
technologies provider Hydrogenics Corporation, based in Mississauga, Canada. 
With roots spanning 70 years, Hydrogenics is the worldwide leader in designing, 
manufacturing, building and installing industrial and commercial hydrogen 
generation, hydrogen fuel cells and large-scale energy storage solutions. 
It was the latest in a series of acquisitions by Cummins. In 2018, the company 
acquired Silicon Valley-based Efficient Drivetrains, Inc. of Milpitas, California.  
It designs and produces hybrid and fully-electric power solutions. The company 
in 2017 acquired Brammo Inc. based in Talent, Oregon. It designs and develops 
battery packs for mobile and stationary applications.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SUPPLY CHAIN 
TRANSFORMS 
SUSTAINABLYCummins’ global supply chain is critical to the company’s 
sustainability, producing clean, efficient and dependable  
products that use fewer of the world’s resources.
The company is 
embracing what some 
call the fourth Industrial 
Revolution, new 
technologies to create cleaner, more 
efficient and safer workplaces, operating 
in a way that protects and preserves 
human rights.
With over 90 manufacturing locations  
in more than a dozen countries,  
including Brazil, China, India, Mexico,  
the United States and the United 
Kingdom, Cummins is well aware that  
its supply chain touches many lives. 
EMBRACING THE FUTURE
Cummins for several years has 
been in the midst of a supply chain 
transformation, becoming more 
integrated and efficient so the  
company can thrive in the future.  
The transformation is broad based, 
including manufacturing, procurement, 
quality, health and safety, and more.A key aspect is the welcoming of  
this new approach to manufacturing,  
which has also been called Industry 4.0. 
It brings together digital, physical and 
biological systems to work smarter,  
safer, cleaner and more efficiently, 
allowing humans to focus on the  
most important tasks.
Cummins has been introducing tools in 
its plants such as collaborative robots,  
or “cobots,” for several years, taking over 
repetitive and awkward tasks to make 
manufacturing safer and more efficient.
The company is also working to  
integrate high-speed 3D printing into  
its manufacturing technology, selling 
its first 3D printed metal part in the 
company’s New and ReCon Parts 
function in the first quarter of 2019.
Cummins invested in new, high  
precision binder jet 3D printing 
technology a month later.A GLIMPSE AHEAD
Linking new technologies via the Internet 
may hold the biggest potential change 
for manufacturing. The Beijing Foton 
Cummins Engine Company (BFCEC) in 
Beijing, China, is so wired with high-tech 
tools it can almost identify defects in 
certain tasks and potential bottlenecks 
before they happen. 
The joint venture has seen significant 
improvements in quality and other 
important metrics. The plant was named 
in January 2020 to the World Economic 
Forum’s Global Lighthouse Network,  
an elite list of leaders in applying  
the technologies of Industry  
4.0 to manufacturing.
These technologies are studied every day 
at Cummins’ Manufacturing Engineering 
Development Center in Columbus, 
Indiana (U.S.). The center is reviewing 
robotic arms and other tools with 
sensors, cameras and even microphones 
that can be linked to the Internet to 
improve efficiency or detect problems.
The center provides Cummins with a 
consistent and uniform way to test these 
ideas for use in the company’s plants.

SUPPLY CHAINS DO 
MORE TO USE LESS  
Cummins’ supply chain has played a critical role in 
meeting the company’s 2020 environmental goals, and 
will play a key role in meeting the 2030 goals included  
in Cummins’ PLANET 2050 environmental strategy.The company’s efforts to reduce its 
environmental impact in many ways 
started at Cummins’ manufacturing 
plants, which have implemented 
numerous initiatives to reduce the  
water and energy the company  
uses and the waste it disposes. 
In ways ranging from the simple to 
complex, the company has avoided  
the use of about 1 billion gallons of  
water since 2010, most through the 
company’s manufacturing sites.  
Now, at sites such as the Rocky Mount 
Engine Plant in North Carolina (U.S.), 
Cummins is implementing state-of-the-art 
water treatment systems that will allow 
the vast majority of water used on site  
to be reclaimed and reused.
Cummins has reduced energy intensity, 
energy used adjusted by hours worked, 
more than 30% under the company’s 
2020 environmental goals. Much of that 
also can be linked to the company’s 
manufacturing sites, which have taken steps such as improving lighting and 
heating and air conditioning with newer, 
more efficient systems.
Cummins has also been steadily  
adding regenerative dynamometers,  
also known as regen dynos, that are 
capable of capturing the energy used  
by an engine in a test cell and converting 
it into electricity to help power the plant. 
The Cummins Technical Center, for 
example, gets about 23% of its energy 
from regen dynos.
More than 1,000 employees  
across the globe serve as  
Environmental Champions, trained  
to look for inefficient practices or 
equipment that can be replaced.  
The company believes the champions 
know their plants best and are most 
qualified to look for improvements.
Finally, the company recycles more  
than 90% of the material it touches,  
with the largest volumes taking place at 
the company’s manufacturing facilities. 
Company personnel frequently  
share best practices with suppliers,  
who must state they comply with 
Cummins’ Supplier Code of Conduct 
principle No. 6, which says they  
will “protect the environment and 
preserve natural resources.”

SUPPLY CHAIN WORKS TO 
PRESERVE HUMAN RIGHTS
Cummins has long insisted its suppliers uphold human  
rights and support the company’s opposition to any kind  
of compulsory labor or any form of human trafficking. 
That position was redoubled in 
December 2017 when the company 
finalized its Human Rights Policy after 
a nearly year-long review. The policy 
specifically addresses:
 »Human trafficking and exploitation.
 »Forced labor, child labor, bonded labor, 
prison labor and military labor.
 »Foreign and migrant worker rights.
The policy states in addition to its own 
operations, Cummins will take steps to 
“ensure our suppliers and partners that 
are located in high-risk locations and/
or that may be more exposed to human 
trafficking risk due to the nature of the 
industry in which they operate adopt 
relevant measures to mitigate such risks.”In many ways, the policy was merely an 
extension of the language long included 
in the company’s Supplier Code of 
Conduct, which also states Cummins’ 
opposition to compulsory labor and 
human trafficking. 
“We insist that our suppliers uphold 
these principles and we are committed 
to working with all suppliers and other 
partners as they undertake similar  
assessments of their own business,”  
the code states.
In 2018, when Cummins revised its 
Supplier Code of Conduct, the company 
required its more than 4,000 suppliers to 
accept the new code – 100% accepted 
the company’s supplier code.One of the primary ways the company 
checks for compliance among its 
suppliers is through Eyes Open Audits. 
These audits are regularly performed 
when purchasing and other personnel 
visit suppliers to review contract 
performance. They look specifically 
for problems in worker health, worker 
safety, protecting Cummins information, 
hazardous or unsafe materials and child 
labor, as well as issues pertaining to the 
treatment of others.
In 2019, there were 391 Eyes Open 
Audits completed. That’s an 8% decline 
from the previous year. It should be 
noted, however, that the company began 
to curtail travel during the last half of the  
 year as Cummins recognized economic 
activity was slowing in many key markets.
During 2019 the company worked 
to align its audits specifically with the 
Human Rights Policy looking ahead  
to 2020 and beyond.

CUMMINS 
ACHIEVES RECORD 
PROFITABILITY IN 
2019, PREPARES 
FOR EXPECTED 
DOWNTURN IN 2020
While revenues fell 1% in 2019 compared 
to a record 2018, net income at Cummins 
increased 9.5% as the company ratcheted 
down expenses when the global economy 
slowed in the final quarter of the year.Revenues for all of 2019 were  
$23.6 billion compared to $23.8 billion in 
2018. But earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) 
were a record $3.6 billion (15.3% of 
sales) or $3.7 billion (15.8% of sales) 
excluding restructuring. This compares  
to $3.5 billion or 14.6% of sales in 2018.
Net income attributable to Cummins  
for the full year was $2.3 billion  
($14.48 per diluted share), or $2.4 billion 
($15.05 per diluted share) excluding 
restructuring, compared to net income  
of $2.1 billion ($13.15 per diluted share) 
in 2018. The effective tax rate for the  
full year was 20%.
“Despite challenging conditions in many 
of our largest markets over the last six 
months, Cummins delivered record 
profits and operating cash flow in 2019,” 
said Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger 
when the 2019 results were released on 
Feb. 4, 2020. 
The announcement came about a month 
before COVID-19 was declared a global 
pandemic, which will be reflected in next 
year’s report. The belt-tightening the 
company did in 2019 better positioned 
Cummins for the impact of the virus 
during the first six months of 2020  
(see the Chairman’s note on page X). Lower truck production in North 
America and weaker demand in the 
global construction, mining, and power 
generation markets drove most of the 
revenue decrease in the final quarter of 
2019. Currency also negatively impacted 
revenues by 1%, primarily due to a 
stronger U.S. dollar.
The company executed several measures 
to reduce costs and improve future 
performance in the second half of 2019. 
These actions included a plan to reduce 
headcount, which resulted in a charge of 
$119 million ($90 million after tax) in the 
fourth quarter of 2019.Despite the slow-down, the company 
made a record investment in research, 
development and engineering expenses 
in 2019, topping $1 billion as Cummins 
explored low-carbon platforms such as 
electrified power, as wells as hydrogen- 
and natural gas-powered fuel cells. 
Cummins also continued improving 
the company’s diesel and natural gas 
product lines and related components.
