Message from our Chairman  
and Chief Executive Officer,  
Hans Vestberg
2020 was a year like no other. As a global community, we faced some of the greatest 
challenges of our lifetime, and as a company, Verizon navigated obstacles that forced us 
to alter our ways of working, communicating and operating to keep people connected. 
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took swift and decisive action to protect the 
health and safety of our employees, to keep our customers and communities connected, 
to enhance our network during a time of unprecedented demand, and to communicate 
in real time to our employees, suppliers and partners worldwide via daily live webcasts. 
We consistently showed up for all of our stakeholders – often in creative and resourceful 
ways – as discussed throughout this 2020 ESG Report. Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Approach Social Community SASB index Governance Environmental
3Verizon’s purpose is to create the networks that move the world forward. As we emerge 
from the COVID-19 pandemic, we must move forward toward an inclusive recovery that 
lifts our communities to a state of economic, environmental and social advancement that 
exceeds pre-pandemic levels. COVID-19 placed a spotlight on the inequities in our society. 
As such, we believe the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals belong at the 
heart of any COVID-recovery plan in order to attain a socially just and green recovery 
for all. At their adoption, the Goals were established with a challenging 2030 deadline. 
With just under 10 years to achieve the Goals, we have a great deal of work still to do. 
Citizen Verizon , our responsible business plan for economic, environmental and social 
advancement, reinforces our commitment to addressing the most pressing societal 
issues of our time – the digital divide, climate change and human prosperity.
Digital Inclusion
As a society, we’ve made vast leaps in our digital transformation, creating extraordinary 
opportunity, but also increased vulnerability for those who are not currently connected. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how basic activities like learning, working, transacting 
and socializing rely on meaningful connectivity. But far too many people are missing  
out on the opportunities of the digital economy because they lack reliable, affordable 
access or face challenges using technology. We’re working with communities and 
government to help tackle this issue by expanding digital access with affordable and 
accessible products and services, promoting digital literacy with innovative programs 
directed toward underserved communities and urging holistic and broad solutions  
to address the digital divide. 
Verizon immediately recognized the urgency for school districts to quickly and seamlessly 
secure connectivity for students to participate in remote learning during the pandemic. We 
launched a new, national Verizon Distance Learning program , where we have partnered 
with independent school districts and state departments of education to deliver 4G LTE 
wireless connectivity, devices and other solutions to students nationwide. In particular, we 
are providing K-12 institutions with reliable connectivity, devices (i.e., hotspots/MiFi units), 
mobile device management and other security/compliance apps that school districts 
rely on to support distance learning at significantly discounted rates. By the end of 2020, 
discounted internet access, devices and security solutions were available for purchase 
by school districts to support distance learning across 41 states and the District of 
Columbia. But this is just the start.
I believe digital inclusion will be one of the defining issues of our time and that it is now 
or never to take action. Working with the World Economic Forum, I am proud to Chair the 
new EDISON Alliance. This groundbreaking global movement aims to mobilize industry 
sectors to quicken the pace of digital development and accelerate the opportunity for 
every person to participate in the digital economy. This is the moment for leaders across 
all sectors to join forces behind the idea that access to and affordability of digital services 
is a top priority not just for recovery, but for growth and development.I believe digital 
inclusion will be the 
defining issue of 
our time and that it 
is now or never to 
take action. Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Approach Social Community SASB index Governance Environmental
4Climate Protection
The opportunity for companies to show leadership on the urgent issue of climate change 
is historic. Greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase and according to the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world continues to heat up. We believe 
this is a breakthrough moment for business action on climate change, which is why, 
despite the pandemic, Verizon is committed to making significant strides on our path to 
becoming net zero in our operations by 2035. In a little over a year, Verizon has become 
one of the largest corporate buyers of U.S. renewable energy, entering into 13 long-term 
renewable energy purchase agreements totaling nearly 1.7 gigawatts of renewable energy 
capacity. And to support our renewable energy strategy, we have launched two $1 billion 
green bond offerings, the first U.S. telecommunications company to do so.
We recognize the role that transparent disclosure plays in informing our stakeholders of 
our progress on our ambitious 2035 net zero goal, so we publicly report our greenhouse 
gas emissions and disclose our climate-related risks and impacts in our Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures report . We ask all companies to join us in adopting 
ambitious climate commitments and transparent reporting to help build coherent policies 
for a healthy planet and aid the transition to a net zero economy. 
Human Prosperity 
This past year, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted and magnified inequalities throughout 
our society, and the tragic death of George Floyd, and too many others, forced society to 
reckon with ongoing racial injustice. These events have sparked powerful conversations 
inside of Verizon about racism and bias. We have discussed our perspectives on what 
needs to change in corporate America and in broader society to bring about true racial 
equality. As I explained in my address to all Verizon employees in response to the events 
unfolding around the country: “We cannot commit to a brand purpose of moving the world 
forward unless we are committed to helping ensure we move it forward for everyone.”
As a company, we have long recognized that, in addition to being the “right thing to do,” 
building a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to our success. This is why we 
increased our transparency around our diversity and inclusion efforts by publishing our 
Consolidated EEO-1  data and providing more detailed information about our workforce 
composition. We have donated $10 million to seven organizations dedicated to social 
justice, including the NAACP and The National Urban League, which have been fighting 
for progress on this issue for many years. We have a responsibility as a large corporation 
with a global voice to do right by our friends and colleagues, and we hope to inspire 
others to speak up and take action as well. 
2020 began the Decade of Action to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals. May 2021 be a year of action driven by the combined efforts of the public and 
private sectors in partnership to create a better, more sustainable future for all of us.

5Verizon seeks to be known as a responsible, purpose-driven, trusted brand on 
the cutting edge of innovation to benefit our four key stakeholders: customers, 
shareholders, employees and society. We believe that we have a responsibility to 
leverage our technology, operations and employees to help move the world forward  
into a more connected, secure and sustainable future. Our ESG strategy is built to  
see this vision come to fruition by effectively governing and managing key ESG risks 
and opportunities that arise from our core business operations:  
• Promoting diversity and inclusion  makes us  
a stronger and more competitive company. 
• Championing digital responsibility and inclusion   
is essential to earning our customers’ trust and growing 
our business.
• Mitigating climate risk  presents us with the opportunity 
to deliver innovative solutions that advance the transition 
to a low-carbon economy. 
• Fostering a culture of integrity  and being mindful  
of the social and environmental impacts of our products 
and services, including human rights impacts, builds trust 
with our key stakeholders.   
• Investing in reliable networks and affordable services  
keeps us all connected, from first responders, to 
businesses, to schools and  
our communities. 
The way we govern our impacts on people, society and  
the environment and how we discuss this work through  
our transparency and engagement are important parts  
of demonstrating our responsible business conduct.Our ESG strategyVerizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Approach Social Community SASB index Governance Environmental

Message from our Chief ESG Officer 
This past year represented a new and exciting chapter for Verizon as our newly formed 
cross-functional ESG team worked to manage risk and opportunity in key ESG areas 
and publish more decision-useful ESG-related disclosures. We adopted a fresh, holistic 
approach to engaging with key stakeholders, fostering internal collaboration and enhancing 
our transparency around ESG-related risks and opportunities in strategic areas, including 
governance, human rights, environmental sustainability and digital responsibility. 
In 2020, we elevated our reporting by aligning with several external frameworks and 
standards to increase our disclosure on material issues like data privacy and energy 
consumption. In conjunction with the release of our 2019 ESG Report, we published 
our first Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) index. We also published 
our first report aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to share how we’re mitigating climate change risks and 
proactively pursuing the opportunities of the transition to a low-carbon economy.  
We believe that the SASB standards and TCFD recommendations are instrumental  
in allowing us to illustrate how Verizon is addressing the ESG issues that are most 
critical to our long-term success. 
We hope that as we continue to manage our ESG risks and opportunities and strengthen 
our reporting and engagement, our investors and stakeholders will continue to hold us 
accountable and encourage us to push the boundaries of what we can achieve. Verizon 
has made significant strides, but there’s always more work to be done, and by sharing 
this progress we hope you will follow us on this journey.

7Prioritizing our material ESG issues
This report is informed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (SASB) 
standards applicable to our business, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, 
feedback received through engagement with our investors and other stakeholders  
and a materiality assessment.  
In 2019, we partnered with nonprofit organization BSR to conduct a series of internal 
and external interviews to evaluate the most impactful ESG issues related to our 
business. We will be updating this assessment in 2021.  
A material ESG issue is one that has the potential to impact Verizon’s long-term 
sustainability from the perspective of our internal and external stakeholders. In  
the matrix that follows, each issue is prioritized according to the degree to which  
it could potentially impact our business and society. Our ESG strategy cares for  
all of the listed issues.

8Supporting the achievement of 
the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs)
Verizon’s role as a leading communications technology company makes it incumbent  
on us to use our scale and innovation to help make progress toward the SDGs. 
As we entered the Decade of Action, we reconfirmed our belief that Verizon’s technology 
is an essential tool to support the achievement of all 17 SDGs and affirmed our focus on 
specific goals where we believe Verizon, through our resources and assets, can have the 
most significant long-term impact. 
We analyzed all 17 SDGs and 169 targets to identify the priority goals and targets aligned 
to our core business purpose of creating the networks that move the world forward. Not 
only do our customers rely on our high-quality, resilient networks to connect to what 
matters most to them, Verizon’s networks also affect our communities and environment  
in a number of meaningful ways. To address the impacts and opportunities associated 
with Verizon’s business strategy, we are focused on the following SDGs: 
This alignment relates to our community investment and sustainability efforts, our policy 
engagement and our long-term business strategy.
In 2020, Verizon continued to lead the U.S. telecommunications industry in green 
finance. Prior to launching our second billion-dollar green bond offering in less than  
two years, we published a Green Financing Framework  that articulates how our 
sustainable finance strategy aligns with the UN SDGs and supports our progress on 
our environmental commitments. Our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis, is an active 
participant in the UN Global Compact’s CFO Taskforce for the SDGs . This initiative 
brings together a multistakeholder group of corporate finance leaders to develop 
innovative strategies to address the world’s most pressing issues. Verizon’s 
technology  
is an essential 
tool to support 
the achievement 
of all 17 SDGs. Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Approach Social Community SASB index Governance Environmental
9SDG 4: Quality education
As our economy becomes more reliant on technology, we recognize that many of  
the jobs of the future will be influenced by automation, artificial intelligence and  
other emerging digital technologies. As a telecommunications company, we know  
it is important to not only increase broadband access across the U.S., but also to 
proactively support our community in advancing digital skills so that everyone can  
thrive in our increasingly digital world. 
Verizon makes significant investments in technology education because we feel it is 
the right thing to do. In addition to increasing gender and ethnic diversity in high-skill 
positions, it also expands our talent pipeline for future hiring. These activities align  
with our core business values and are integral to our long-term corporate strategy. 
 
Target 4.4:  By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who 
have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, 
decent jobs and entrepreneurship.
Verizon’s impact
Through Verizon Innovative Learning, we are providing students with free 
technology, free internet access and technology-driven curriculum to 
transform the learning experience. 
Verizon is supporting our community by preparing people for the jobs of the 
future through a reskilling program focused on those who are unemployed, 
underemployed, facing job displacement due to automation or further 
challenged by the pandemic.
Goals:
•    By 2030, provide 10 million youths with digital skills training. 
•    By 2030, prepare 500,000 individuals for jobs of the future.
Progress:
•     Since 2014, Verizon has provided over 480,000 youths with digital skills training. 
•    Since 2019, we have prepared over 4,200 individuals for jobs of the future.Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Approach Social Community SASB index Governance Environmental
10SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy
Almost all of our operational carbon emissions come from the electricity we use to power 
our networks. This is why renewable energy and energy efficiency are the focus of our 
environmental strategy. Through investments in clean energy solutions and upgrades to 
our facilities and infrastructure, Verizon is doing our part to green the U.S. energy grid 
and make strides toward achieving our two ambitious corporate climate goals.
Target 7.2: By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the 
global energy mix.
Verizon’s impact
Verizon is supporting the transition to a greener grid by making substantial 
investments in renewable energy. 
Goal:  Source or generate renewable energy equivalent to 50% of our total annual 
electricity consumption by 2025.
Progress:  We have entered into long-term virtual power purchase agreements for 
nearly 1.7 GW of anticipated renewable energy capacity.  
Target 7.3:  By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.
Verizon’s impact
Verizon is actively working to improve the energy efficiency of our operations.
Goal:  Achieve net zero emissions in our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2035.
Progress:  Please see our operational emissions profile .Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Approach Social Community SASB index Governance Environmental
11SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth     
Entrepreneurship is a proven pathway to economic opportunity. Businesses owned  
by women, people of color and military veterans have historically received a fraction  
of the resources of their peers. Verizon is helping small businesses be digitally ready  
and resilient through not only the COVID-19 pandemic but also in an increasingly  
digital future.
Target 8.3:  Promote development-oriented policies that support productive 
activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and 
encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized 
enterprises, including through access to financial services.
Verizon’s impact
We are supporting small businesses to be digitally ready today and in  
the future. 
Goal: By 2030, provide 1 million small businesses with resources to help them 
thrive in the digital economy.
As a leading communications technology company in the U.S., we recognize that our 
connected solutions can help our customers save energy and significantly reduce their 
own carbon emissions. From telecommuting to smart building management, we see 
endless possibilities for Verizon’s products and solutions to support our customers  
in reducing their own impact.
Target 8.4: Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency 
in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth 
from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-year framework of 
programmes on sustainable consumption and production, with developed countries 
taking the lead.

carbon emissions.Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Approach Social Community SASB index Governance Environmental
12SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth   
Target 8.4 continued: 
Goal: In 2020, we met our goal for our networks and connected solutions to save 
more than double the amount of emissions that our operations create. Verizon’s 
new goal is for our solutions to help avoid 20 million metric tons of CO 2e annually 
by 2030.
Progress:  In 2020, our solutions enabled the avoidance of 12 million metric tons of 
CO 2e, the equivalent to taking 2.6 million cars off the road. The emissions avoided 
represent approximately 2.8 times the emissions generated by Verizon’s operations. 
We understand the importance of diversity and inclusion, including compensating all 
individuals equitably for similar work. We believe that businesses must play a critical  
role in reducing the national pay gap for women and racial and ethnic minorities. 
Target 8.5:  By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for 
all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and 
equal pay for work of equal value.
Verizon’s impact
One of the ways we live up to our commitment to diversity and inclusion is by 
paying all employees performing similar work equitably.
Goal: Have 100% pay equity annually in salary for women and men globally, as  
well as with respect to race and ethnicity in the U.S.
Progress:  In 2020, across all of Verizon, we had 100% pay equity in salary for 
women and men. In the U.S., we also had 100% pay equity in salary with respect  
to race and ethnicity.Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Approach Social Community SASB index Governance Environmental
13SDG 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure 
As a vital provider of critical network infrastructure, Verizon’s primary goal has always 
been to keep our employees, customers and society connected to the people and 
resources that are important to them. The resilience of our networks reflects many 
years of significant investment so that we can continue to serve our customers even in 
times of crisis, whether it be from hurricanes, floods, wildfires or other unforeseeable 
events like the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Target 9.4: By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them 
sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of  
clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with  
all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities.
Verizon’s impact
We are continually strengthening the resilience of our networks to enable 
communities affected by climate-related hazards and natural disasters to  
have access to communication services when they need them the most.
We are driving energy efficiency in our networks through a variety of interventions, 
including migrating copper-based services to fiber technologies, installing LED 
lighting in our facilities and using better cooling technologies in our data centers.

14SDG 13: Climate action 
Verizon’s employees play a critical role in the success of our environmental initiatives. 
With the rapidly changing climate already impacting our lives, we know it is just as 
important for us to educate and empower our employees on sustainable actions  
as it is to implement our many companywide measures. 
 
Target 13.3:  Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional 
capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and  
early warning.
Verizon’s impact
The Verizon Green Team is a grassroots collective of employees dedicated 
to environmental stewardship. The Green Team raises awareness of climate-
related issues and provides both educational and volunteer opportunities.
Goal:  50% of Verizon employees will be Green Team members by the end of 2026.
Progress:  In September 2020, we met our prior goal of having 30% of Verizon 
employees become Green Team members. Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Approach Social Community SASB index Governance Environmental
15SDG 15: Life on land 
Conservation and biodiversity are critical to reducing carbon emissions and combating 
climate change. Trees are central to many biological systems and have immeasurable 
additional benefits outside of lowering our global footprint: trees moderate temperatures 
in cities, filter pollution from the atmosphere, support the availability of clean drinking 
water, reduce noise in busy environments, improve mental health and much more. 
Target 15.1:  By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use  
of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular  
forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under  
international agreements.
Verizon’s Impact
From replanting forests for hurricane recovery to supporting urban forestry,  
we’re focused on restoring lost tree canopies and enabling cleaner air and  
healthier communities.
Goals: By the end of 2030, Verizon plans to plant 20 million trees.
Progress:  Verizon has planted over 6 million trees.Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Approach Social Community SASB index Governance Environmental
16SDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions 
Verizon is committed to moving the world forward for everyone, regardless of their 
background or circumstances. We know that we can only achieve global sustainable 
development when we also resolve issues related to conflict, insecurity, weak 
institutions and limited access to justice. 
We aim to promote inclusive societies where the rights of all people are respected 
and where rule of law is observed through our corporate actions, policy development, 
donations and employee-led volunteering efforts. 
Verizon’s impact
• Verizon supports peace, justice and strong institutions through our core 
business strategy. We have developed comprehensive policies, processes 
and systems to address corruption and bribery by employees, suppliers and 
third-party agents.
• We share our commitment to operating with respect for human rights in  
our Human Rights Statement . Our dedicated Business & Human Rights 
Program  drives our work to identify and address the human rights impacts 
of our core business strategy, operations, products and services.
• Verizon provides financial and in-kind support to the National Center for 
Missing and Exploited Children to further their work fighting online child 
exploitation, providing assistance to victims and finding missing kids.
• We advocate for criminal justice reform and the Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals immigration program.
• Through our pro bono program, we promote access to justice by providing 
free legal services to society’s most vulnerable populations.Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Approach Social Community SASB index Governance Environmental
17Engaging collaboratively
We believe that engaging openly and transparently with our investors and other key 
stakeholders on issues impacting Verizon, including ESG risks and opportunities, drives 
increased corporate accountability, improves decision-making and ultimately creates 
long-term value.
Communicating with investors
We strive for a collaborative approach with our investors to solicit and understand their 
perspectives on a variety of corporate governance, compensation and ESG topics 
that may impact our business or reputation, and we share what we learn from these 
exchanges with our Board and senior management. These engagements include the 
participation of our Lead Director, or other directors, when requested and appropriate. 
In 2020, we took a new, proactive approach and engaged with our top 100 investors 
and socially responsible investors in email blasts and one-on-one conversations about 
Verizon’s ESG activities and priorities; our response to COVID-19; governance matters 
and shareholder rights; executive compensation and ESG; our climate commitments 
and renewable energy; data privacy, cybersecurity and child safety; political 
contributions and lobbying; and racial justice. 
In addition to our regular investor engagement, in 2020, we retained a third-party 
consultant to survey approximately 80 of Verizon’s equity and fixed-income investors 
to obtain feedback on the effectiveness of our communications and engagements with 
them and reviewed the survey results with our Board.
Exchanging ideas with peers and experts
We also value our engagement with industry peers, human rights experts, technologists, 
advocates, academics, investors, journalists, governments and other experts. We regularly 
engage and maintain strong relationships with these key stakeholders on our climate- 
and human rights-related risks and opportunities, including the impacts of our policies, 
products and services. We are committed to sharing our learned experiences from our 
reporting journey with our peers through publications, workshops and webinars because 
we believe that we need to act together if we are to be successful in our collective mission 
to create a more sustainable and responsible society for everyone. 
In 2020, we partnered with Accounting for Sustainability (A4S) to produce a publicly 
available case study  on implementing the TCFD recommendations and shared what we 
learned as a first-time issuer of a TCFD report on a publicly available webinar hosted by 
Ceres and A4S. Our Chief ESG Officer also wrote a blog for the Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board about Verizon’s experience with SASB reporting.Case study:

18Listening to consumers
Our long-standing Consumer Advisory Board (CAB), composed of diverse leading 
business and public-interest advocates, provides us with an unfiltered view of relevant 
technology, consumer, business and social issues at biannual meetings. CAB members’ 
perspectives and advice play a role in the development of many important Verizon 
policy and business decisions.
T aking our employees’ pulse
We view employee engagement as a strategic approach to driving growth that is directly 
tied to business performance. Engaged employees are enthusiastic and committed, 
which translates into stronger customer service, meaningful innovation and an inclusive 
culture where everyone feels a sense of belonging and pride.
 
That’s why we partnered with Gallup, an industry leader in workplace analytics and 
insights, to launch the VZPulse+ survey to benchmark and track our progress around 
engagement over the next five years. We strongly encourage all of our employees to 
participate in these regular surveys, which solicit feedback on a range of issues relating 
to our workplace culture and business strategies. We’ve provided our leaders with 
training to help them translate the insights received from these employee surveys  
into actionable strategies. 
 
While surveys provide an excellent source of truth and direction, we are constantly 
listening and learning from our employees, including town halls and leadership forums 
with employees. In 2020, our leaders frequently joined company webcasts to discuss 
and answer questions on the business and personal implications of the COVID-19 and 
racial justice crises. Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Approach Social Community SASB index Governance Environmental
19Earning trust with 
transparent reporting
We strive to make it easy for stakeholders to learn about our positions and progress  
on the issues that matter to them. To that end, we have created an ESG Resources Hub  
on our Investor Relations website that houses all of our ESG reporting and policies. 
We have a long history of reporting on our corporate responsibility performance. In 2020, 
our new ESG team advanced our reporting strategy by publishing Verizon’s first SASB 
index, outlining how our ESG disclosures align with the recommended quantitative metrics 
and qualitative disclosures of the SASB Telecommunications Services standard. This year 
we have expanded the scope of our SASB index  to also address the Internet Media & 
Services standard. On Earth Day 2020, we published our inaugural TCFD Report . In this 
climate-specific report we share Verizon’s strategy for mitigating climate change risks 
and proactively pursuing the opportunities of the transition to a low-carbon economy. 
We also publish the following key reports and commitments:
• Verizon’s Human Rights Statement , explaining our commitment to operating with 
respect for human rights.
• Verizon’s broadband commitment , outlining our commitment to an open internet that 
provides consumers with competitive broadband choices and internet access—
when, where and how they want it.
• Information about Verizon’s digital safety program , including metrics on Verizon’s 
fight against the dissemination of child sexual abuse material.
• A semiannual Transparency Report , presenting the number of requests for customer 
information that we receive from law enforcement in the U.S. and other countries in 
which we do business, as well as discussing the demands we receive to block websites.
• A semiannual Political Engagement Report , disclosing all of Verizon’s PAC 
contributions, corporate political contributions, support for ballot initiatives  
and independent expenditures, as well as listing our public policy organization’s 
significant memberships in trade organizations.
• Verizon’s Green Financing Framework , aligning our green financing activities with the 
UN SDGs, and our Green Bond Reports , detailing the impacts of our allocation of the 
net proceeds of green bond issuances.
• Our U.K. Modern Slavery Act Statement  and Australia Modern Slavery Act Statement , 
discussing our efforts to prevent acts of modern slavery and human trafficking from 
occurring within our business and supply chain.
• Our Conflict Mineral Policy , discussing our collaboration with industry organizations 
and our suppliers to enhance visibility into, and eliminate conflict minerals from, our 
supply chain.TCFD Report

How we govern
We consider good governance essential to driving our success and building long-term 
sustainable value for our stakeholders. 
Our Board of Directors oversees Verizon’s strategic planning and execution, risk 
management, capital deployment, responsible business practices and human capital 
management with the assistance of four standing committees composed solely of 
independent directors. An independent Lead Director shares governance responsibilities 
with the Chairman and CEO and facilitates forthright communication and effective 
independent oversight of management’s performance. 
We are committed to the highest standards of corporate governance, and our policies 
and practices align with the Investor Stewardship Group’s corporate governance 
principles for U.S. listed companies .
Fostering Board diversity  
Good governance starts with independent and engaged directors who have a strong 
sense of integrity and respect for differing viewpoints. We believe a board that embodies 
a range of viewpoints, backgrounds and expertise is best positioned to provide new 
perspectives to our management team as it addresses the challenges and opportunities 
impacting our business. 
In its ongoing board refreshment process, our Board seeks a diverse group of candidates 
who possess the requisite judgment, background, skill, expertise and time, as well as 
diversity with respect to race, ethnicity and gender, to strengthen and increase the 
overall diversity, breadth of skills and qualifications of the Board. At December 31, 2020, 
our 10 member Board included three women and four Black or Hispanic members.
Overseeing ESG strategy and risks
Our Board recognizes that operating responsibly—minimizing the environmental impact 
of our operations, protecting the privacy of our customers’ information and respecting 
human rights by creating an environment of respect, integrity and fairness for our 
employees and customers wherever we do business—is fundamental to the long-term 
success of our company. 
The Corporate Governance & Policy Committee oversees corporate responsibility and 
sustainability. Verizon has a Chief ESG Officer dedicated to enhancing the company’s 
sustainability reporting and stakeholder engagement on ESG issues that align with 
Verizon’s core business strategy. The Chief ESG Officer heads a cross-functional  
team that focuses on strategic areas, including governance, reporting, human rights, 
environmental sustainability and digital trust and safety, and also oversees Verizon’s In 2020, we  
joined The Board

charter member, 
pledging to continue 
to encourage the

efforts to deliver on our ESG commitments. The Chief ESG Officer regularly provides 
the Corporate Governance & Policy Committee with updates on the company’s ESG 
priorities, commitments and reporting.
Environmental sustainability and climate
To address climate-related risks, Verizon has set ambitious goals to source or generate 
renewable energy equivalent to 50% of our total annual electricity consumption by 2025 
and to achieve net zero emissions in our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2035. We are 
taking steps to make our networks more energy efficient and climate resilient and to 
develop solutions that will help our customers save energy and significantly reduce 
their carbon emissions. Each committee of the Board oversees the management of  
the specific risks related to our environmental sustainability strategy and the transition 
to a low-carbon economy that fall under the committee’s area of responsibility:  
• Audit Committee.  Environmental and climate-related risks discussed during annual 
business risk reviews with the Audit Committee include operational and financial 
risks relating to energy management and our renewable energy and net zero 
commitments, maintaining network reliability during catastrophic and weather-related 
events, and legal and regulatory developments that seek to mitigate climate change 
through carbon policy.
• Corporate Governance & Policy Committee.  At least annually the Chief ESG 
Officer briefs the Corporate Governance & Policy Committee on Verizon’s progress 
on meeting our environmental sustainability commitments.
• Finance Committee.  The Finance Committee oversees the strategy for managing 
risks related to Verizon’s renewable energy exposure through renewable energy 
purchase agreements, as well as the company’s green financing strategy.
• Human Resources Committee.  To motivate management to be good stewards of our 
planet and reduce the environmental impact of our operations, the Human Resources 
Committee has included a carbon intensity reduction target as one of the performance 
measures in the short-term incentive plan since 2014. 23
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Governance Social Community SASB index Environmental Approach
Data privacy and cybersecurity
Our Board is committed to maintaining strong and meaningful privacy and security 
protections for our customers’ information. The Audit Committee has primary 
responsibility for overseeing Verizon’s risk management program relating to data 
privacy and security and cybersecurity. The Audit Committee also monitors Verizon’s 
compliance in the areas of data and privacy protection. 
• Data privacy and security.  Our Chief Privacy Officer annually briefs the Audit 
Committee on data privacy risks and mitigating actions. For more information  
about the technical, administrative and physical safeguards that Verizon has  
in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of 
customer information and data that we collect and store, please see Privacy  
and Data Protection .
• Cybersecurity.  Our Chief Information Security Officer leads an annual review  
and discussion with the full Board dedicated to Verizon’s cyber risks and threats  
and cyber protections and provides updates throughout the year, as warranted.  
For more information about our enterprisewide information security strategy,  
policy, standards, architecture and processes, please see Cybersecurity . 
Responsible business 
Verizon’s Responsible Business Council, chaired by the CEO and composed of members 
of the senior leadership team, oversees the integration of responsible practices as a 
core operating principle. At least annually, the Chief Corporate Social Responsibility 
Officer reports to the Board on the Council’s activities and Verizon’s community and 
social impact initiatives. In 2020, Verizon launched Citizen Verizon , our responsible 
business plan for economic, social and environmental advancement, which focuses  
on three pillars: Digital Inclusion, Climate Protection and Human Prosperity.
Current policy issues and corporate reputation 
The Corporate Governance & Policy Committee has primary responsibility for 
overseeing the company’s handling of business and reputational risks relating to 
Verizon’s position and engagement on important public policy issues, as well as 
individual events and incidents that may affect our reputation. Each year, Verizon’s  
Chief Administrative, Legal & Public Policy Officer leads a discussion on the current 
policy issues facing the company that may generate publicity and impact corporate 
reputation and reviews the processes in place to quickly respond to any such 
developments. Outside the regular meeting cycle, management makes sure that the 
Board is informed of current developments that may pose reputational risks to the 
industry or the company.24
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Governance Social Community SASB index Environmental Approach
Political activities and lobbying
The Corporate Governance & Policy Committee oversees our political activities, including 
lobbying, and receives a comprehensive briefing on these activities at least annually. Our 
political activities are subject to robust internal controls; our Code of Conduct requires 
that all lobbying activities be authorized by public policy or legal personnel; and our 
employees undergo lobbying training. Verizon understands that transparency regarding 
our political engagement is critical, so we publish our Political Engagement Report  twice 
a year. Our report also discloses our Public Policy organization’s membership in trade 
organizations that receive more than $50,000 annually from Verizon and explains how we 
address disagreements with respect to positions taken by the organizations we support.
Human rights
As expressed in our Human Rights Statement , Verizon is committed to operating with 
respect for internationally recognized human rights. We have a dedicated Business  
and Human Rights Program  that works to embed human rights considerations into 
responsible business decision-making processes across the company. Our human 
rights efforts are overseen by the Corporate Governance & Policy Committee.
Anti-corruption
The Audit Committee oversees our robust anti-corruption program and is briefed annually 
by our Chief Compliance Officer on Verizon’s continued compliance with applicable 
anti-corruption rules. For more information on our program, see Anti-Corruption .
Overseeing human capital management
Culture and employee engagement 
Our Board views our workforce as one of Verizon’s most critical assets and regularly 
receives briefings from the CEO on initiatives to reinforce our company culture and 
encourage employee engagement. The CEO reviews with the Board the results of our 
Pulse+  surveys completed by employees across the company. Periodically, our directors 
attend employee town halls, participate in leadership forums with employees and, in 2020, 
several of our directors appeared on company webcasts to discuss the COVID-19 crisis 
and racial justice matters with employees across the company. 
Diversity and inclusion 
The Board views Verizon’s commitment to creating a collaborative, inclusive and diverse 
environment—within Verizon, with our customers and among our business partners and 
suppliers—as a business imperative and a competitive advantage. To promote diversity 
in our workforce and encourage the contribution of diverse business partners to our 
success, the Human Resources Committee has included diversity targets as performance 
measures in the short-term incentive plan for over 20 years. The Chief Human Resources 
Officer reviews diversity representation and initiatives with the Committee at least annually.Political Engagement

Succession planning and talent development
Our Board recognizes that one of its most important duties is to promote continuity  
in Verizon’s senior leadership by overseeing the development of executive talent and 
planning for the efficient succession of the CEO. The Human Resources Committee has 
primary oversight responsibility for succession planning, including assignments to key 
leadership positions and related compensation decisions. Our Board generally conducts 
an in-depth review of senior leader development and succession planning at least once 
a year. Led by the CEO and the Chief Human Resources Officer, this review addresses 
Verizon’s management development initiatives, assesses senior management resources 
and identifies individuals who should be considered as potential future senior executives.
Employee health and safety
At least annually, our Chief Human Resources Officer briefs the Board on employee and 
contractor health and safety policies, practices and incidents, including actions taken to 
screen suppliers’ EHS performance and programs to ensure that we are partnering with 
safe and environmentally friendly suppliers.26
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Governance Social Community SASB index Environmental Approach
How we operate
At Verizon, we drive our business forward through the management structures we have 
put in place and the planning and implementation process we use for decision-making 
and execution.
We have organized management of our business operations around the customers we 
serve—Consumer, Business and Media—with a centralized Global Network & Technology 
Group managing our world-class networks. Our primary corporate functions provide 
financial, administrative, legal, public policy, marketing and strategy support and oversight 
to the business groups.
To gain a holistic perspective and appropriately assess risks and opportunities when 
making important decisions for the business, we have established a number of cross-
functional management councils composed of members of our senior management 
team from each business group and centralized function and overseen by our CEO.  
Our management councils address a wide range of matters that are critical to our 
company’s success, including business and technology strategies, product development, 
brand strategy and customer experience, social responsibility, resource allocation and 
emergency preparedness.
Conducting business responsibly
Both our Board and senior leadership team recognize that operating responsibly—
promoting ethical business practices and the well-being and health of our environment, 
employees, customers and communities—is fundamental to the long-term success  
of Verizon.
For the past several years we have been evaluating the state of responsible business 
practices across our enterprise, with the goal of integrating responsibility into every 
aspect of our business. The Verizon Responsible Business Council (RBC), chaired by our 
CEO and composed of members of our senior leadership team, oversees this process. 
The RBC helps our company set ambitious impact goals and monitors progress toward 
achieving them. Our CEO, with support from the RBC and Board, has committed to meet 
the responsibilities of the UN Global Compact and to collaborate with its members to 
bring about positive change.27
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Governance Social Community SASB index Environmental Approach
Ethics and compliance
Our enterprisewide compliance program
Verizon’s compliance program is overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board of 
Directors and managed by the Chief Compliance Officer. Our compliance program  
is designed to promote an enterprisewide culture of integrity and accountability by:
• Establishing standards of conduct, including the Code of Conduct, corporate policy 
statements and other guidelines.
• Educating employees regarding ethical decision-making, legal obligations and 
compliance risks through training and communications.
• Assessing legal and ethical risks, and providing insights regarding those risks to 
business leaders. 
• Providing subject matter expertise and advice regarding specific risk areas.
• Providing employees and third parties with mechanisms to seek guidance, raise 
concerns, and report allegations of misconduct.
• Investigating instances of potential misconduct.
• Ensuring appropriate corrective action for substantiated cases of misconduct.
• Providing regular reports to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Our Code of Conduct
At Verizon, we are defined by our values: integrity, respect, performance excellence, 
accountability and social responsibility. Our Code of Conduct  is a powerful tool that 
helps employees to make choices that put those values into action. The Code provides 
employees with clear standards, helpful examples and information about where to go when 
they need guidance about ethical decision-making or wish to raise compliance concerns—
including a Verizon Ethics  hotline that allows for anonymous reporting or “whistleblowing.”
The Code is available to employees in 11 languages (Chinese, Dutch, English, French, 
German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish). All Verizon 
employees receive mandatory Code of Conduct training at their time of hire. Code 
provisions are continually reinforced through annual training and periodic communications. 
The mandatory Code training is also available to employees in the 11 languages.Code of Conduct
Verizon EthicsLearn more28
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Governance Social Community SASB index Environmental Approach
The current version of the Code, like every prior iteration, features extensive coverage 
of anti-corruption issues, including Verizon’s absolute prohibition on bribery, our policy 
requirement to obtain legal approval before providing anything of value to any government 
official, the need for adequate controls over third parties who may interact with government 
officials on our behalf and the importance of maintaining records that fully and accurately 
document all business transactions.
Our ethics office
Verizon’s integrated ethics and compliance organization delivers consistent guidance 
on integrity issues, so that as we create the networks that move the world forward,  
we do it the right way. Verizon’s Ethics serves as the primary resource for employees 
seeking ethics advice and assistance and has two primary functions: fielding questions 
about ethics issues and responding to concerns and complaints about potential 
misconduct. The team: 
• Provides a confidential, 24/7 global compliance hotline and an online web portal  
that can accommodate calls in numerous languages for anyone who wants to seek 
guidance or report ethics concerns.
• Triages concerns and allegations raised, making sure that they are assigned to the 
correct teams in the Human Resources, Legal, Finance and Security organizations.
• Provides ethics advice to employees seeking guidance in applying the Verizon Code 
of Conduct and company policies to business decisions or outside interests.
• Administers the annual Conflict of Interest Questionnaire process.
Verizon thoroughly investigates all claims of misconduct. We have various teams within 
the Human Resources, Legal, Finance and Security organizations that are specially 
trained to probe potential violations of the Code. Verizon strictly prohibits retaliation 
against employees for submitting complaints or cooperating with investigations. 
Anyone engaging in retaliation is subject to discipline, up to and including termination 
of employment. Our Chief Compliance Officer regularly reports any serious Code 
violations to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.29

Anti-corruption
Verizon enforces a zero-tolerance policy for bribery or corruption of any kind. All 
employees receive general anti-corruption training as part of their annual Code of 
Conduct training. In addition, V Teamers in relevant operational roles receive targeted 
anti-corruption training and communications that clearly articulate our expectations, 
core principles and zero tolerance for any corrupt practices. Our training, which 
incorporates practical examples, helps employees understand and comply with various 
anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery 
Act. We instruct employees to obtain legal approval before giving anything of value to a 
public official. We have internal controls in place, such as monitoring of travel, gifts and 
expenses, to help deter and detect high-risk transactions. We supplement our general 
compliance training with targeted communications and in-person instruction on an 
as-needed basis. 
Every two years, we review and assess our anti-corruption program, with the goal of 
finding areas for improvement, and our Chief Compliance Officer reports the findings  
to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
T ax compliance
Verizon strictly complies with all applicable tax laws, regulations and tax compliance 
requirements, including enhanced reporting obligations such as the OECD Country 
by Country Reporting and the European Union DAC 6 Mandatory Disclosure Regime. 
Further, Verizon discloses income and non-income taxes paid in our publicly filed 
consolidated financial statements.30

Human rights
Our Credo  underlies our commitment to human rights, expressed in further detail in our 
Human Rights Statement . We are committed to operating with respect for internationally 
recognized human rights. Our approach to this work is guided by the human rights due 
diligence framework set forth in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
Our human rights efforts  are overseen by the Corporate Governance & Policy 
Committee of our Board of Directors and led by the Business and Human Rights 
Program (BHRP), which is part of the ESG office under the remit of the Chief 
Administrative, Legal and Public Policy Officer. The BHRP works in partnership  
with teams throughout the Public Policy, Law & Security and Global Supply Chain 
organizations, as well as other functions, including Corporate Social Responsibility.
Our work today builds on a proud history. In spring 2008, Yahoo took the bold step of 
creating a dedicated team, the BHRP, to lead its efforts to make responsible business 
decisions in the area of human rights. This was the first business and human rights 
program in the ICT sector. A decade later, when we acquired Yahoo, our leadership 
prioritized the build-out and scaling of the BHRP across the Verizon enterprise. The 
BHRP was empowered to provide centralized leadership and to advise, from a human 
rights perspective, on global strategy, business decision-making and internal and 
external engagement with stakeholders. 
Since that time we have been hard at work enhancing our efforts to understand and 
manage our human rights impacts. We have done this by taking a structured approach 
to embedding human rights considerations into responsible business decision-making 
processes across the company. 
Our efforts include attention to the human rights impacts of our products, services, 
strategy and operations, and to our engagements with employees, customers, 
communities, governments, business partners and suppliers. In partnership with teams 
across the company, the BHRP conducts regular and ongoing human rights due 
diligence (HRDD), as set forth in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, to identify, understand and address the human rights implications of our 
business decisions, including our technology, products, services and strategy. Our Credo
Human Rights 
Statement
Human Rights at VerizonLearn more31
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportAppendix Governance Social Community SASB index Environmental Approach
As part of this process, we undertake Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs) to 
more specifically evaluate and address human rights risks that may intersect with our 
business. This includes attention to such rights as privacy (including data privacy), 
freedom of expression and information, and nondiscrimination, with specific attention to 
vulnerable groups. Based on what we learn, we identify potential human rights risks and 
opportunities that could arise from Verizon’s products and operations. We then make 
recommendations to avoid or mitigate those risks, protect our customers and users, 
and promote human rights with our products and on our platforms. As part of our HRDD 
and HRIA processes, we consult externally with a variety of local, regional and international 
experts, including government agencies, human rights organizations, academics, 
journalists and other experts. Read more about our approach to HRIAs here .
Within Verizon we host regular training and awareness-raising activities to provide 
employees with guidance and tools to operate in a manner that is consistent with our 
human rights commitments. This year we developed an employee learning module with 
information on international human rights, Verizon’s commitment to respect human 
rights and the work of the BHRP.
Our approach is one of continuous learning and improvement. A critical part of 
our efforts to embed human rights considerations into business decision-making, 
as led by the BHRP, is the ongoing evaluation and refinement of our efforts as the 
company continues to undergo change and transformation and as new innovation and 
technological advancements emerge. Building on the legacy of work that began more 
than 12 years ago, we will continue to consider both the human rights impacts of our 
current activities, and, with an eye on the future, we will endeavor to understand and 
address the potential impacts of tomorrow’s technologies and business practices.32

Tackling climate change
Climate change is a serious threat that warrants meaningful action, and we are committed 
to doing our part to meet the enormity of this challenge. That is why Verizon has set an 
ambitious goal to achieve net zero emissions in our operations by 2035. 
In 2020, we joined The Climate Pledge , an initiative focused on achieving the Paris 
Agreement 10 years early by 2040. Recently, we confirmed that we are all in  and will 
continue to increase our ambitions and amplify our support of the Paris Agreement in 
the years to come. 
Even as Verizon grows our 5G network nationwide, we are committed to reducing our 
carbon footprint and operating as a responsible business. We are moving from older 
technologies to newer, more energy-efficient ones. This includes migrating copper-based 
services to fiber technologies, as well as migrating to our newer intelligent edge network 
platform. We are installing energy-efficient systems and employing energy management 
best practices at our facilities, including installing LED lighting, and we’re using better 
cooling technologies in our data centers. 
As a first step on our net zero journey, we have committed to source or generate renewable 
energy equivalent to 50% of our annual electricity consumption by 2025. In a little over a 
year, Verizon has become one of the largest corporate buyers of U.S. renewable energy, 
entering into 13 long-term power purchase agreements totaling nearly 1.7 gigawatts (GW) 
of renewable energy capacity. These agreements support the construction of new wind 
and solar facilities. With these agreements, we are making significant progress toward our 
renewable energy goal.
 
In addition, Verizon recognizes the opportunities associated with the transition to a low-
carbon economy. We believe we are uniquely positioned to enable connected solutions 
to help our customers save energy and significantly reduce their carbon emissions. In 
2020, our solutions enabled the elimination of 12 million metric tons of CO 2e emissions. 
We’ve set a new goal that by 2030 Verizon solutions will help avoid 20 million metric 
tons of CO 2e annually.
From investments in clean energy to upgrades to our facilities and infrastructure to 
reforestation projects, we are making measurable strides toward achieving a net  
zero future.Verizon has set

Our path to net zero
To achieve net zero emissions in our operations by 2035, Verizon is focused on 
improving the energy efficiency of our networks and facilities, supporting the 
transition to a greener grid by entering into power purchase agreements with 
renewable energy developers and investing in on-site green energy at our facilities.

Science-based emissions reduction targets
In addition to our net zero goal, we have announced two science-based emissions 
reduction targets. We have committed to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
53% by 2030 over a 2019 baseline and to reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions from our 
value chain 40% by 2035 over a 2019 baseline.
The target covering emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) is consistent with 
reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C. Our value chain target is consistent with 
reductions required to keep warming to well-below 2°C.
These targets were calculated using methodologies approved by the Science Based 
Target initiative (SBTi) that are in line with a level of emissions reduction that science 
suggests is necessary to avoid the most significant impacts of climate change.
Carbon intensity
We set a goal to reduce our carbon intensity—a measure of the carbon our business 
emits divided by the terabytes of data carried by our networks—by 50% against our 
2016 baseline. We met this goal in 2019*, achieving a 53% reduction. 
Having met this goal, our efforts are now focused on achieving net zero operational 
emissions by 2035. To support this effort, the Human Resources Committee has 
continued to include a carbon intensity reduction target as one of the performance 
measures in the short-term incentive plan.
 
*Because this data is externally assured it was not available for inclusion in the 2019 ESG Report at 
the time of publication.
Improving energy efficiency
We are improving energy efficiency across our networks and facilities in a variety of ways. 
For example, we are migrating copper-based services to fiber technologies, which are 
more energy efficient. We are also installing energy-efficient systems and employing 
energy management best practices across our footprint.
Improving energy efficiency in network cooling
Almost all of our operational carbon emissions come from the electricity we use to 
power our networks, so maximizing energy efficiency is a critical priority for us. One  
of the main ways we maximize energy efficiency is through a variety of interventions 
targeting network cooling. These interventions reduce overall site energy usage and 
maintenance costs, as well as extend the life expectancy of our equipment. 
 
We have optimized our cooling system settings at our network facilities so that cooling 
system demand is reduced. These adjustments are based on well-established industry 
guidelines with no detrimental effect on network performance or reliability. We have 
also deployed smart cooling systems across a number of technical network facilities  We achieved a 
53% reduction in 
carbon intensity 
over our 2016 
baseline.36
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportEnvironmental Governance Appendix Social Community SASB index Approach
to optimize the cooling system capacity and telecommunications equipment demand 
through machine learning algorithms. We are in the process of replacing and upgrading 
older cooling systems with newer, high-efficiency cooling systems that meet or exceed the 
latest industry energy-efficiency standards. These upgrades include systems equipped 
with “free cooling” economizers that have the ability to significantly reduce cooling energy 
during the appropriate climate conditions.
Managing energy use in our data centers 
Our data center designs and operations leverage the full range of environmental 
tolerances allowed by most server, storage and network hardware suppliers. This 
enables the wide use of energy-saving practices such as direct outside air (free) 
cooling, waterside economizer, evaporative cooling, aisle containment and passive 
exhaust. We also leverage the full limits of our power and cooling infrastructure by 
monitoring and managing the power demand profile at each layer of distribution. And, 
in some locations, we use Artificial Intelligence-Machine Learning algorithms to support 
energy conservation. 
Our data center design embraces modular construction practices that allow for quick 
deployment and seamless integration so new data center capacity arrives just in time. 
This prevents underutilized capacity from obstructing operations, cost and energy-
efficiency goals. 
Verizon’s trailing 12-month (TTM) weighted average power usage effectiveness (PUE) 
as of November 30, 2020 was 1.38.
Improving energy efficiency in our facilities
We recognize the impact of building energy efficiency on our efforts to reduce our 
carbon footprint and, more broadly, on climate change. That’s why we’re proud to work 
with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ENERGY STAR program to certify 
our eligible facilities. 
We have achieved 646 ENERGY STAR certifications for our properties since 2001 and 
remain committed to pursuing ENERGY STAR certification for 100% of our eligible facilities.
In 2020, we received ENERGY STAR certification at three data centers in Colorado, 
New Jersey and California. For the eighth consecutive year, the EPA named Verizon an 
ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year and again recognized us for Sustained Excellence.
As part of our energy efficiency strategy, we are replacing inefficient lighting across our 
portfolio with energy-efficient Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting. In 2020, we retrofitted or 
replaced approximately 201,000 bulbs in 166 buildings across nearly 9 million square feet.
Verizon has also completed 357 LEED-certified projects since 2009.ENERGY ST AR®

Fleet fuel consumption
Efforts to reduce our fleet fuel consumption include replacing older service vans, 
employing hybrid vehicles, switching from V8 engines to V6 engines, rolling out engine 
calibrations to reduce fuel consumption, and replacing aerial lifts with systems that run 
solely on electric power so a technician can turn off the vehicle’s main engine. 
The amount of fleet fuel consumed in any period is largely driven by factors such as the 
volume and type of work performed during the period, as well as the type of vehicles 
required to perform the work. In 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented 
new temporary dispatch and garage protocols that resulted in some field technicians 
being able to keep their work vehicles at remote locations, such as their homes, to support 
social distancing.
EV charging
To encourage our V Team members to use electric vehicles (EV) with ease and 
confidence, we have expanded access to EV charging across Verizon facilities.  
At year-end 2020, EV charging stations were available at 79 locations, exceeding  
our goal of 75 locations. 38
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportEnvironmental Governance Appendix Social Community SASB index Approach
Supporting the development of renewable energy
Given that the electricity that powers our networks is responsible for most of Verizon’s 
emissions, our support of renewable energy and the transition to a greener grid is a key 
enabler to achieving our net zero future. 
Our network operations are located across the country and require a 24/7 supply of 
electricity to operate. It is not feasible to power our network operations directly from 
solar or wind generation facilities during every hour of every day, so we are dependent 
on sourcing power from our nation’s electrical grids. Today much of that power is “brown” 
power, produced from conventional fossil fuels such as coal and oil. To achieve our 
renewable energy goal, we are focusing our resources on accelerating the transition 
to greener electrical grids across the U.S.
We are working to bring additional renewable energy to the grids by entering into 
long-term power purchase agreements for solar and wind power under development. 
The agreements, called virtual power purchase agreements, or VPPAs, are financially 
settled and can help reduce Verizon’s long-term exposure to energy price volatility.
By providing the developers of renewable energy facilities with long-term revenue 
certainty for a project, these agreements can enable them to obtain the capital they 
need to construct the new solar or wind energy facility. We generally do not take 
physical delivery of the energy from the facility under these agreements. Rather the 
facility operator sells the energy into the wholesale market, and we typically receive  
the renewable energy credits (RECs) associated with the energy sold. We intend to 
retire these RECs against our actual energy consumption to track our progress in 
meeting our renewable energy goal. 
As of December 31, 2020, we have entered into long-term VPPAs for a total of nearly 
1.7 GW of anticipated renewable energy capacity. The projects covered by these 
agreements are expected to commence commercial operations over the next three 
years. The additional renewable energy capacity supported by these agreements is 
expected to reduce carbon emissions by an amount equivalent to removing more than 
630,000 passenger vehicles from the road on an annual basis.
We continue to identify new projects under development, and we are on track to meet our 
2025 renewable energy goal, despite delays due to COVID-19.In 2020, Verizon

Verizon 2020 ESG ReportEnvironmental Governance Appendix Social Community SASB index Approach
Investing in on-site green energy
While facilitating the development of additional renewable energy for the electrical 
grids is the primary focus of our renewable energy strategy in terms of resource 
allocation, we remain committed to developing on-site green energy generation at our 
administrative offices and other facilities where it makes sense. 
Since 2013 we have installed more than 28 MW of green power at 26 locations. In 2020, 
we activated more than 8 MW of additional on-site solar at eight of our facilities. In addition 
to contributing to our achievement of our renewable energy goals, our on-site solar 
installations are a powerful signal to our employees of our commitment to sustainability.
Green financing
We continue to seek ways to integrate sustainability considerations into our corporate 
finance processes, including through capital raising, investor communications and 
impact reporting. In 2020, we published a Green Financing Framework  that articulates 
our sustainable finance strategy and commitment to reporting the potential environmental 
impacts of our investments. The Framework outlines how our selection of environmental 
projects and reporting for future green financings will align with international green 
bond principles, support our environmental objectives and advance the U.N. Sustainable 
Development Goals. The Framework also provides us with a platform for dialogue with 
external stakeholders about our sustainability strategy and the initiatives we are 
undertaking to build a healthier, cleaner future. 
In 2019, Verizon became the first U.S. telecommunications company to issue a green 
bond. In the third quarter of 2020, we fully allocated the nearly $1 billion of net proceeds 
of that bond and issued a second $1 billion green bond. The majority of the proceeds  
of our inaugural green bond were allocated to long-term renewable energy purchase 
agreements that support the development of additional renewable energy for the grids 
that power our networks. We anticipate that our investments in these renewable energy 
agreements, as well as on-site renewable energy projects, will enable the avoidance of 
913,089 MT of CO 2e annually.

Verizon has voluntarily disclosed the greenhouse gas emissions associated with our energy consumption for 20 years. 
External assurance
Verizon annually seeks independent assurance for key ESG data, including our emissions 
profile. In 2020, we commissioned independent external assurance of our Scope 1, 2 
and 3 (exclusively business travel) GHG emissions and carbon intensity for 2019. Please

Helping our customers reduce their carbon footprints
As a global communications technology leader, we recognize that our networks and 
connected solutions can help millions of customers save energy and reduce their 
own carbon emissions. According to the GeSI Digital with Purpose Report , by 2030 
digital technologies are expected to deliver reductions in carbon emissions equivalent 
to nearly seven times the size of the growth in information and communications 
technology (ICT) sector emissions over the same period. 
We partner with the nonprofit Carbon Trust to measure the yearly CO 2 equivalent 
(CO 2e) emissions avoided by our customers through Verizon’s products and services. 
In 2020, we met our 2022 goal for our networks and connected solutions to save more 
than double the amount of emissions that our operations create. Our solutions enabled 
the avoidance of 12 million metric tons of CO 2e in 2020, equivalent to taking 2.6 million 
cars off the road for one year. The emissions avoided represent approximately 2.8 times 
the emissions generated by Verizon’s operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions). 
As Verizon progresses toward achieving our ambitious corporate climate goals, including 
achieving net zero operational emissions by 2035, setting an absolute reduction goal 
instead of an approximate goal holds us accountable for enabling greater reductions 
for our customers, even as we reduce our own carbon footprint.We’ve set a new

been to keep our employees, customers and society connected to the people and 
resources that are important to them. 
Meeting the challenges of COVID-19
This year’s coronavirus pandemic presented us with a new type of crisis as for the first 
time in modern history we witnessed most of our society shift to working and learning 
from home, testing our networks in new and unimaginable ways. We’re proud that for 
the first 90 days of the pandemic, we were able to maintain pre-COVID reliability levels, 
despite spikes and shifts in user demand. Additionally, Verizon’s industry-leading team 
of engineers and technicians were able to continue and even, in some cases, accelerate 
deployment of our 5G network. 
The resilience of our networks reflects many years of significant investment so that 
we can continue to serve our customers even in times of crisis, whether it be from 
hurricanes, floods or other unforeseeable events.
Depending on the geographic area and type of risk, steps to enhance infrastructure 
resilience have included:
• Adding stilts to raise equipment that powers cell sites. 
• Moving site generators from basements to a higher level or platforms.
• Installing new fiber solutions underground rather than using aerial fiber.
We also have ongoing efforts to improve backup facility power systems, including power 
capacity at facilities located in areas with greater storm and wildfire risk, by adding 
generators to at-risk sites where, historically, the site only had backup batteries.We’re proud 
that for the first 
90 days of the 
pandemic, we  
were able to 
maintain  
pre-COVID 
reliability levels. 43
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportEnvironmental Governance Appendix Social Community SASB index Approach
In advance of a known event, backup batteries and generators at facilities that rely 
on commercial power are tested and fueled to keep power flowing and customers 
connected in case of prolonged commercial power outages. Refueling teams are on 
standby to keep generators running through the duration of the event. In addition, 
Verizon’s disaster recovery fleet of emergency vehicles stands ready for deployment. 
The fleet includes a 51-foot mobile command center, two 53-foot mobile emergency 
calling centers and satellite cell sites which can provide connection for first responders 
at temporary Emergency Operation Centers or field command centers.
We have several established formal processes for managing business continuity, 
including our corporate policy on business resilience, which sets forth a policy 
regarding National Security Emergency Preparedness. The policy requires us to 
establish and maintain a plan for the continuity of operations and management in the 
event of local emergency or widespread disaster. Following a natural disaster, our 
Verizon Response team is available 24/7 to coordinate with first responders. 
Through Skyward, a Verizon commercial drone company, we’re also able to use drones 
as a means to assist in recovery efforts for natural disasters and provide first responders 
with reliable communications services in their immediate aftermath. Skyward’s solutions 
also allow us to inspect our sites without putting field personnel in harm’s way.
We encourage you to read our TCFD Report  for more information.
Water conservation
Although water use is not a material ESG issue for Verizon, we recognize that water is 
an extremely important resource. 
We are focused on reducing water use across our facilities. Through 2019, we achieved 
a 9% reduction with usage at 2.35 billion gallons, down from 2.6 billion gallons in 2016. 
Our goal is to achieve a 15% reduction over our 2016 level by 2025. 
We seek external assurance of our annual water usage results. For details, including our 
full calculation methodology, please read the Independent Accountants’ Review Report . 
Our 2020 water usage is currently undergoing independent external assurance. We will 
report the results later in 2021. 44

Our goal is to divert as much e-waste as possible from landfills by reusing or responsibly 
recycling materials. Our priority is to reuse electronics internally. When that is not possible, 
we market these materials for reuse through approved vendors or work with partners to 
recycle them responsibly. Verizon defines e-waste as electronic products and parts, such 
as cell phones, chargers, set-top boxes, network equipment and batteries, that are at 
the end of their useful life and/or have been returned by customers.
Our recycling practices exceed regulatory mandates. We audit facilities that manage 
Verizon’s hazardous or regulated waste, including battery recycling smelters, on a regular 
schedule. Verizon works with e-waste vendors that manage our waste in accordance 
with high industry standards for environmental stewardship, such as R2 or e-Stewards.
In 2020, Verizon recycled or reused more than 38.3 million pounds of telecommunications 
equipment, electronic products, batteries, paper, cardboard and other items. We recycled 
more than 33 million pounds—and reused nearly 2.6 million pounds—of e-waste. Recycled 
e-waste included over 1.2 million pounds of associated plastic and nearly 3.5 million 
pounds of lead-acid batteries. Verizon practice is to require lead-acid batteries from our 
U.S. operations to be sent to Verizon-approved recycling facilities in the U.S. or Canada 
and to require our vendors to provide certificates of recycling for the batteries. 
Community recycling rallies
To support our communities in safely recycling e-waste, Verizon sponsors multiple 
recycling rallies across the country each year. These events are free and open to our 
employees and the public. Community members can bring in any e-waste item ranging 
from a personal computer to a television to a toaster for safe disposal. 
We held fewer in-person events in 2020 due to COVID-19. The 19 recycling events we 
held collected more than 650,000 pounds of e-waste. Verizon has collected more than 
4.8 million pounds of e-waste since 2009, toward our goal to collect and recycle 5 million 
pounds of e-waste between 2009 and 2022.E-waste: Expanding  
recycling and reuse
In 2020, we 
recycled or  
reused more  
than 35.6 million 
pounds of e-waste.45

Verizon is committed to the sustainable sourcing and use of paper. We have pledged 
that at least 50% of our paper sourced annually will have at least 10% post-consumer 
waste (PCW) content. 
In 2020, we exceeded this goal with 70% of our sourced paper including at least 10% PCW 
content. This excludes billing segments that are not able to print on recycled content paper 
because of machinery issues. Please see our Paper Sourcing and Use Policy .
Verizon has an integrated environment, health and safety (EHS) management system 
that provides guidance, instruction and best management practices that meet or exceed 
regulatory requirements while striving for continual improvement.
Our EHS management system provides a framework for identifying, controlling and 
reducing the risks associated with the locations in which we operate. Besides performing 
regular management-system assessments, we also perform internal and third-party 
compliance audits and inspections annually at facilities worldwide. The goal of these 
assessments is to identify and correct site-specific issues and to educate and empower 
employees to implement corrective actions. Verizon’s EHS efforts are directed and 
sustained around the world by experienced professionals who support our operations 
and facilities.
Our EHS management system is based on the International Standards Organization 
(ISO) 14001 and 45001 standards. We maintain ISO 14001 and Occupational Health 
and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001, and Safety Schemes in Procurement 
(SSiP) certification in some markets, and we are pursuing an integrated ISO 14001  
and 45001 certification. Verizon’s EHS Management Corporate Policy describes our 
commitment to the health and safety of our V Team, the public and the locations in 
which we operate. Our EHS policy is sponsored by Verizon leadership.Paper policy

Conservation and biodiversity are critical to combating climate change. Trees not only 
address climate change by acting as an efficient and cost-effective method to remove 
carbon from the atmosphere—they also mitigate the negative impacts of our changing 
climate for people and critical ecosystems.
In 2020, we pledged to sponsor the planting of 20 million trees worldwide by 2030. From 
replanting forests for hurricane recovery to supporting urban forestry, we’re focused on 
restoring lost tree canopies and enabling cleaner air and healthier communities.
Verizon is a member of the U.S. chapter of 1t.org —the Trillion Trees Platform led by 
the World Economic Forum and American Forests to support the global movement to 
conserve, restore and grow 1 trillion trees worldwide. 
In 2020, we partnered with Arbor Day Foundation, Texas Trees, Eden Reforestation and 
others to plant more than 4.4 million trees. This included 50,000 trees in areas impacted 
by hurricanes. To date, Verizon has supported the planting of more than 6.1 million trees 
(2009 through 2020). Tree planting
The Green Team is a grassroots employee effort that builds sustainability into 
everything we do. 
Green Team members work to help Verizon reduce our environmental impact at work 
and to reduce their personal impact at home. Green Team members participate in a 
variety of educational webinars and curated volunteer activities across the globe. 
In September 2020, we met our goal of having 30% of V Teamers on the Green Team. 
We’ve set a new goal for 50% of Verizon employees to be Green Team Members by 2026. Verizon’s Green TeamHear from Dan

Board oversight of climate risk and sustainability
Verizon’s Board and executive leadership team recognize that operating responsibly, 
which includes minimizing the environmental impact of our operations, is fundamental 
to the long-term success of the company. We believe building a better future involves 
making climate awareness “business as usual” throughout our organization, starting at 
the top. This is why our Board’s oversight role and management governance structures 
are evolving to include more regular assessment and discussion of climate-related risks 
and opportunities. The Corporate Governance & Policy Committee oversees corporate 
responsibility and sustainability. Please see our TCFD Report  for more information. 
Linking compensation to sustainability
To motivate management to be good stewards of our planet and reduce the 
environmental impact of our operations, the Human Resources Committee has included 
a carbon intensity reduction target as one of the performance measures in the short-
term incentive plan since 2014.
T ransparent climate-related disclosures
We know that transparency regarding climate-related risks and opportunities is  
critical to maintaining the trust of our stakeholders and allows our investors to  
better understand the implications of climate change. Please see our TCFD Report

Digital responsibility
Digital safety
Helping parents keep kids safe online
Verizon is committed to serving parents through products and services that empower 
them to make the best decisions about how to guide and moderate their children’s 
online experiences. 
To honor this commitment, we work to keep parents up-to-date on the latest online 
safety advice through our Parenting in a Digital World  portal, which features guidance 
for parents of children of all ages. Busy parents can quickly find practical advice on 
topics that range from screen time for toddlers to teen driver safety. Information on the 
portal is carefully vetted and comes from a variety of expert sources. 
Verizon also offers parents a portfolio of products and services that give them the 
ability to customize their children’s digital experience through robust parental controls 
and differentiated product offerings. Our Family Tech hub  brings all of these offerings 
together, with product recommendations tailored to the age of the child. 
Combating online child exploitation
We recognize that we have an important role to play in combating the use of the 
internet to exploit children. As a leading provider of internet access services, as well  
as communications and content platforms through Verizon Media, we understand that 
the same tools that empower our customers to communicate with family and friends 
can also be misused to disseminate child sexual abuse material.
To protect our platforms from child predators, we’ve employed several best practices 
and committed extensive resources to the fight, including:
Cutting-edge technology.  We use the latest technology, including PhotoDNA, to
scan images and videos uploaded to our platforms against databases of known  
child sexual abuse material.  
Expert human reviewers.  A dedicated team of child safety specialists review
material flagged by our scanning technology, proactively search for material in flagged 
accounts that may have been missed by automated scanning, and investigate user 
reports of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). All confirmed CSAM is reported to 
the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which acts as a 
clearinghouse for law enforcement.
Proactive investigations.  Our in-house investigators develop and transmit attribution 
information about offenders who traffic in child sexual abuse material on our platforms 
to NCMEC. These reports have led to numerous arrests, in some cases less than  
24 hours after they were filed. Hear from NCMEC’s 
CEO, John Clark, 
about the importance 
of partnerships in 
fighting online child 
exploitation and 
finding missing kids .

Verizon 2020 ESG ReportSocial Environmental Governance Appendix Community SASB index Approach
Forging strong partnerships
Verizon works closely with a number of innovative, best-in-class organizations that are 
committed to protecting children and empowering parents.
Verizon partners with NCMEC by providing both financial support and donated media to 
further NCMEC’s essential work of fighting online child exploitation, providing assistance 
to victims and finding missing kids. In 2020, Verizon donated $1 million in online advertising 
to NCMEC—ads that were used by NCMEC to help find missing children, promote 
NCMEC’s digital safety curriculum and otherwise advance NCMEC’s mission.
Verizon is also a member of the Family Online Safety Institute, a leading voice on digital 
safety issues that aims to make the online world safer for kids and their families. And 
Verizon is a member and leader at the Technology Coalition, a cross-industry working 
group dedicated to preventing and eradicating child sexual exploitation and abuse. 
Robocalls
A “robocall” is a phone call that is automatically generated and/or prerecorded. These 
calls are often spam. Robocalls are so prevalent that an FCC report  projected that 
approximately half of all phone calls made in the U.S. in 2019 were robocalls.
Verizon has always worked hard to protect our customers from these unwanted calls. 
While ultimately the problem needs to be addressed by stopping illegal robocalls at the 
source and by implementing technology to prevent bad actors from disguising their 
identities, we are providing customers with ways to directly protect themselves from 
robocalls in the meantime.
In 2020, Verizon blocked or alerted over 7 billion spam calls. By the end of 2020, over 
75 million customers received spam call blocking tools.We commend 
Verizon for being  
a leader on child 
safety issues, and 
are grateful for the 
financial and in-
kind support that 
will help advance 
our mission.  
This innovative 
partnership will 
allow NCMEC to 
reach vast new 
audiences through 
Verizon’s digital 
media assets, and 
we believe this 
increased exposure 
will directly result  
in more missing 
children coming 
home safely.

Tools for customers 
We provide tools that wireless and wireline customers can use to help insulate 
themselves from unwanted and illegal robocalls. Almost all Verizon wireless customers 
can block or avoid spam calls for free with the Call Filter  app*. Call Filter is preloaded 
on most Android devices and available to download on iOS. Customers can upgrade to 
Call Filter Plus for a small charge if they want advanced features like Caller Name ID, 
Spam Risk Meter, Spam Look Up, Personal Block List and more.
Silence Junk Callers is a new iOS 14 native feature to further help protect our Apple 
customers by auto-blocking potential fraud and spam calls by sending them directly to 
voicemail. This feature is turned on by default, but customers have the ability to toggle 
the setting on and off and can view all incoming calls in Recents.
All Verizon wireline customers with Caller ID service receive Verizon’s Spam Alerts 
service for free. Our Fios Digital Voice customers are encouraged to use the free 
blocking service offered by Nomorobo, which relies on the simultaneous ring feature 
that we provide for free to those customers.
Learn more about Verizon’s response to robocalls and how to identify COVID-19-related 
robocalls here .
Encouraging collective action on robocalls 
Verizon cannot eliminate robocalls alone. We have been encouraging other voice 
service providers to implement “know your customer” programs like ours to avoid 
accepting illegal robocall traffic onto their networks, and we are encouraging the FCC 
to set a higher bar for all providers. 
We were among the first in our industry to commit to and begin deploying the new 
“STIR/SHAKEN” call authentication technology, which helps service providers evaluate 
whether a call is spoofed. We have invested substantial amounts of time and resources 
upgrading our networks with STIR/SHAKEN technology. Additionally: 
• Verizon is a founding member of the USTelecom Industry Traceback Group, an 
industry-led organization that traces back suspicious robocall traffic and stops  
many illegal robocalls. 
• Verizon was the first to begin auto-reporting violations to upstream carriers via 
automation and disconnecting large interconnected carriers for their unwillingness 
to adopt industry best practices to stop robocalls. 
• We shared our experience with implementing the STIR/SHAKEN technology and 
best practices through multiple forums to encourage wider adoption.
*This does not apply to customers with legacy CDMA devices or those on Visible and Mobile Wholesale.Verizon has

Radio frequency emissions 
Verizon provides information on radio frequency emissions at verizonwireless.com . 
Verizon equipment complies with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
requirements that all wireless communication devices sold in the U.S. meet guidelines 
for safe human exposure to radio frequency energy. 
In a December 2019 Order , the FCC reaffirmed that its guidelines are adequate 
to protect against adverse health effects and agreed with the Food and Drug 
Administration’s conclusion that “no scientific evidence establishes a causal link 
between wireless device use and cancer or other illnesses.” For more information on 
industry radio frequency emissions, please visit: https://www.verizonwireless.com/

Open internet
Verizon has been at the forefront of innovation in the broadband ecosystem, advocating 
consistent policies aimed at creating a robust, level and dynamic playing field for all 
participants in the internet environment. We have invested billions of dollars in developing 
our broadband networks and have actively encouraged the development of a wide range 
of devices and applications to enable our customers to access and use the internet as 
they choose. As we state in our commitment to broadband consumers :
• Full access.  We will not block any legal internet content, applications or services 
based on their source or content.
• Full speed.  We will not throttle or slow down any internet traffic based on its source 
or content. 
• Fair handling of traffic.  We will not accept payments from any company to deliver 
its traffic faster or sooner than other traffic on our consumer broadband service, nor 
will we deliver our affiliates’ internet traffic faster or sooner than third parties’. We will 
not prioritize traffic in a way that harms competition or consumers.
• Full information.  We will describe our internet access services and our plans in plain 
language so customers can make informed choices.
• High-quality service.  None of these commitments precludes us from reasonably 
managing our networks to ensure everyone has the broadband experience they 
demand and deserve.
The Federal Trade Commission can enforce Verizon’s commitments and address any 
practices that harm consumers or competition. The FCC can also take enforcement 
action if we do not adequately disclose how we handle internet traffic.Commitment to

Privacy and data protection
We recognize that protecting the privacy of customer data is fundamental to 
maintaining our customers’ trust and growing our business. Our company is also 
impacted by current and emerging federal, state and international laws related to 
privacy and data protection. Privacy and data protection are therefore strategic 
priorities for Verizon and Verizon Media, and we have established strong governance 
measures to protect the privacy and security of customer information and to ensure 
compliance with privacy legislation. Our work in this area is conducted under the 
oversight of our Chief Privacy Officer, who reviews and discusses data privacy risks and 
mitigating actions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors at least annually.
Verizon and Verizon Media have adopted corporate policies and operating procedures 
governing how we collect, use, retain and protect data. Detailed information about 
Verizon’s privacy policies and practices can be found at the main Privacy Policy  page  
on our corporate website. This page contains links to supplemental policies for some 
of our apps and services and to separate privacy policies maintained by Verizon Media 
and our affiliated companies.
Our policies and procedures are subject to controls such as internal audits, 
observations, testing, employee and vendor training, and internal attestations that all 
serve to promote ongoing compliance by the business. We also continuously monitor 
for new and modified international, federal, state and local laws, as well as relevant 
interpretations of existing laws and self-regulatory programs, and we update our 
policies and processes as needed. We continue to advocate for a uniform federal 
privacy framework that can apply to all players in the digital technology ecosystem and 
make clear, consistent rules of the road for everyone so that our customers’ trust and 
privacy come first.
Our commitment to privacy extends across our business operations, including Verizon 
Media. Verizon Media operates a global network of digital products and services, some 
of which engage in the purchase, sale, delivery and measurement of digital advertising. 
Verizon Media provides its users with information about how it collects, uses and 
shares data, along with substantial user controls to manage that data. Verizon Media 
also maintains operational and technical controls to protect against unauthorized uses. 
These controls are audited on a regular basis.
Privacy dashboards  
On January 1, 2020, as the California Consumer Privacy Act became state law, we 
launched our Verizon Privacy Dashboard , which allows all Verizon consumers to access 
and manage their personal information. Consumers can explore a summary of their 
collected information, download a portable copy of the information, and delete information 
that is not necessary for their service. Verizon Media also provides a privacy dashboard 
and controls  that permit users of its various brands to see and manage how their personal 
information is used by Verizon Media.Verizon Privacy

Our stewardship of personal data
As stewards of personal information, we have an obligation to handle personal 
information appropriately throughout every phase of the product and service life 
cycle, including the collection, use, disclosure and retention of personal data. We 
disclose our practices and have in place policies related to each phase. We conduct 
privacy reviews when we develop products, systems or other initiatives; offshore work 
through our global clearance process; and purchase or sell assets. Our privacy impact 
assessment (PIA) process provides a platform for formalized review of initiatives that 
involve customer personal information. We have also implemented a third-party risk 
management process that focuses on our highest-risk suppliers.
• Collection and use.  We collect and use information as we describe in our publicly 
available privacy policies and, in some cases for business customers, according to 
our contracts. We seek to minimize the amount of customer data that we collect and 
retain, and we provide customers several different ways to review and keep their 
account information up to date. Our practices are designed to protect and respect 
consumers’ privacy and the choices consumers make concerning the use of their 
data. We give customers easy-to-understand privacy choices, including opt-in choices, 
based on the sensitivity of their personal data and how it will be used or disclosed.
• Disclosure.  We share information within Verizon and with vendors and partners as 
described in our privacy policies. We take measures to protect information that we 
disclose to our vendors and permit them to use it only for the purpose for which we 
provide it.
• Data retention and destruction.  We maintain corporate policies governing data 
retention, and we also review data retention practices as part of our privacy impact 
assessment process. Under our practices and policies, we retain personally 
identifiable and other sensitive records only as long as reasonably necessary for 
business, accounting, tax or legal purposes. We also have policies in place to govern 
data destruction, including guidance related to media sanitization and disposal. We 
also meet the requirements of our enterprise customers by contractually agreeing  
to unique data retention timelines and data destruction practices when needed.  
 
To meet Verizon’s commitment to protect personal data, our employees are responsible 
for cooperating with and assisting business owners in fulfilling the obligations and 
requirements of our information security policy, as well as in complying with applicable 
laws. We also impose our information security requirements on suppliers who handle 
customer data, and we impose additional requirements on suppliers who handle EU/
international personal data.  
 
As it relates to the practices we use to ensure that data is stored securely, Verizon 
and Verizon Media have technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place  
to help protect against a variety of information security risks and cyberthreats. Verizon’s 
Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for leading, and as appropriate, 
coordinating, enterprisewide information security strategy, policy, standards, 
architecture and processes. Please see Cybersecurity  for more information on  
how we protect the security of our systems and networks.55

to all of our employees (including part-time employees). Completion of this course is 
mandatory, and each year’s Code of Conduct course has substantial privacy and 
information security content. In alternating years, a majority of the Code of Conduct 
training focuses on privacy and information security issues. This general training is 
supplemented with training on privacy, handling of Customer Proprietary Network 
Information (CPNI) and other privacy and information security topics for targeted 
groups of employees. In addition, the company provides periodic reminders and other 
communications to employees highlighting information security and privacy issues.
• Third-party employee training. Verizon and Verizon Media also provide training  
on privacy and information security issues to employees of third parties who work 
with us and have access to our sensitive information. We are focused on continued 
improvement of the quality, quantity and cadence of third-party training, including 
training on privacy and information security issues.
Our privacy impact assessment processes
We maintain a PIA process to review our products and systems. We evaluate privacy 
practices using PIAs, which are questionnaires designed to elicit responses from the 
team responsible for developing a new product or system. These include the type of data 
collected, how the data is used, shared and retained, and the third parties that are involved 
in the project. This process aligns in many respects with the policies outlined in the U.S. 
Office of Management and Budget’s “Guidance for Implementing the Privacy Provisions of 
the E-Government Act of 2002” (OMB M-03-22). We use PIAs to identify legal, regulatory 
and policy requirements related to privacy and also to determine risks associated with 
data processing. We also use PIAs before an IT system is deployed to evaluate whether 
data will be protected and to determine whether there are ways to mitigate privacy risks.
Protecting children’s online privacy
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children, including by complying with the 
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). When Verizon or Verizon Media operate 
online services covered by COPPA, we do not knowingly collect personal information from 
children under 13 without parental consent, except where such collection is expressly 
permitted under COPPA for purposes of internal operations. We provide parents with 
information about their rights under COPPA, including instructions about how they can review 
information collected from children. In addition, we comply with the California Consumer 
Privacy Act’s provisions related to the privacy rights of minors, which allow California 
residents under age 18 who are registered users of online sites, services or applications 
to request and obtain removal of content or information that they have publicly posted.
After entering into a consent decree with the NY Attorney General in December  
2018, Verizon Media made a number of changes relating to how it complies with 
COPPA. These changes include (1) retaining recognized legal experts in the child 
privacy space; (2) assembling a dedicated team to work full-time on COPPA compliance; 
and (3) committing to spend several million dollars to ensure the COPPA compliance 
program meets the requirements of the agreement with the NY Attorney General and  
is best in class. 56

Behavioral advertising
Verizon and Verizon Media work closely with the DAA and other industry self-regulatory 
bodies, such as the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and Internet Advertising Bureau’s 
(IAB) U.S., European and U.K. chapters. The principles designated by these bodies, and 
applicable regulatory obligations, inform and shape our oversight of our behavioral 
advertising practices. For example, Verizon Media is fully integrated into the DAA, NAI 
and European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out programs, as well as the 
IAB’s EU Transparency and Consent Framework that provide users with industry-level 
controls. These industry controls are in addition to the privacy choices that Verizon 
Media provides users via our privacy dashboard. Users can therefore opt out of Verizon 
Media’s provision of behavioral advertising either directly or through our partners.
Verizon requires that advertising companies disclose when they are using interest-based 
advertising techniques to deliver ads on our sites and apps as well as when they deliver 
Verizon ads on other sites. We also require them to offer the ability for users to opt out 
of this use of their information. Verizon also has an advertising program, Verizon Selects, 
that helps us and third-party advertisers personalize customers’ experiences and that 
helps promotions, offers and ads better match their interests across the devices they 
use. Customers must opt in to participate in Verizon Selects. The program uses web 
browsing, location, app usage and other information we collect, and combines it with 
information from Verizon Media, to determine whether customers fit within audiences 
advertisers would like to reach. More details about the program and the information it 
uses are available in the Verizon Selects FAQs on our website .
Privacy by design
We assess new products and services for human rights, privacy and security concerns. 
New products are developed using a ”privacy by design” approach to consider and 
mitigate privacy issues and concerns from the earliest stages. We also consider the 
human rights impacts of our products and take other appropriate steps to provide our 
customers with strong and meaningful post-launch privacy and security protections. 
OneSearch: A privacy-focused search engine from Verizon Media 
In early 2020, Verizon Media launched OneSearch, a search service with enhanced privacy 
features that gives unbiased and unfiltered results. Additional OneSearch features include:
• No cookie tracking, retargeting or personal profiling
• No sharing of personal data with advertisers
• No storing of user search history
• Encrypted search terms
Requests from law enforcement
Verizon publishes semiannual reports online that present the number of demands 
we receive from law enforcement in the United States and other countries in 
which we do business. To learn more about how we handle government requests 
for customer information, both in the U.S. and internationally, please see our most

Cybersecurity
There is no higher priority at Verizon than protecting the security of our systems and 
networks. To effectively address the cybersecurity threats posed today, Verizon has  
a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) whose team is responsible for 
leading enterprisewide information security strategy, policy, standards, architecture  
and engineering processes. Verizon’s comprehensive information security program 
includes, among other aspects, vulnerability management, antivirus and malware 
protection, file integrity monitoring, encryption and access control. Verizon also 
maintains a robust cybersecurity insurance program. Each year, our CISO leads a 
formal review and discussion with the full Board, dedicated to Verizon’s cyber risks, 
threats and protections, and provides updates throughout the year, as warranted.
Risk assessment and vulnerability management
Verizon’s enterprisewide Information Security Policy is aligned with the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure 
Cybersecurity (Version 1.1). As part of this policy, we have deployed a comprehensive 
Enterprise Vulnerability Management (EVM) program designed to identify and protect 
against data security risks through the following methods:
• Framework. Our EVM program is governed by a comprehensive policy which 
outlines the core components, cadence and personnel responsibilities necessary  
to sustain a healthy and well-balanced program.
• Risk identification. We continually assess the threat and vulnerability landscape using 
various commercial, government, vendor and publicly available information sources.
• Risk detection.  We use both manual and automated detection methods, including 
Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing 
(DAST), on a scheduled and real-time basis to identify vulnerabilities within our 
network infrastructure.
• Risk evaluation. Identified vulnerabilities are assigned a severity classification based 
on their evaluated risk, using an industry-standard scoring model.
• Remediation.  Vulnerabilities are reported to the appropriate asset owners and 
custodians for remediation. If remediation is not feasible within the policy timeframe, 
a work plan is developed and tracked. In rare circumstances, an exception may be 
approved, which is tracked in a central system of record as mitigating or 
compensating controls are considered and deployed.
• Metrics & reporting.  We collect and retain data for reporting purposes and to enhance 
management accountability for remediation of vulnerable assets. We also use the data 
to assess threat trends and for strategic planning of ongoing program improvements.
External audits and assessments
To validate our enterprisewide vulnerability management program, we enlist outside 
experts to conduct audits and assessments. Annually, we are assessed by an external 
Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) across the broad PCI data security standard 58
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportSocial Environmental Governance Appendix Community SASB index Approach
requirements. Our Global Network Management Cybersecurity Center, as well as our 
data collection infrastructure and analytics platforms, are ISO 27001:2013 certified and 
are subject to yearly audits by a third-party assessor. 
We employ external vulnerability scanning at multiple layers of the technology stack, 
with third-party validation occurring through external penetration testing. And, every 
two years, we engage in an enterprisewide NIST Cybersecurity Framework maturity 
assessment conducted by a third-party assessor, the results of which are presented  
to our Board of Directors.
Empowering our employees
Our people are an important line of defense, so we invest heavily in training our employees 
to protect our networks against attackers. Every Verizon employee receives annual 
information security training. We also rely on phishing simulations, which are sent to  
all of our employees. Employees who fail to recognize these emails are provided with 
additional phishing awareness training so that Verizon can be better prepared when 
targeted by real phishing attacks. We also run an ongoing Cyber Health program 
throughout the year to reinforce security best practices leveraging articles, learning 
curricula, videos and more.
Enhancing 5G cybersecurity
We recognize that potential cybersecurity risks will continue, or arise anew, as adoption 
of 5G expands. Our approach to addressing these concerns is guided by principles in 
security that have underpinned our previous networks and that we can use with greater 
efficiency and effect in 5G.
We are designing and deploying the 5G network with security as a central element, 
relying exclusively on trusted vendors that have undergone rigorous supply-chain 
vetting processes. We routinely assess the software and hardware that goes into 
our network and employ rigorous, documented policies and procedures for secure 
configuration and operation of equipment and devices we deploy throughout the 
network. Components of our 5G infrastructure, even within the network itself, are 
required to authenticate to one another, prior to performing their functions.
Further, we leverage the new 5G architecture and technical standards, which we ourselves 
have helped develop, to provide new security features that did not exist in previous 
generations of wireless technology. Finally, we have helped spearhead global advances 
in the security of the Internet of Things (IoT) and other devices that connect to the 5G 
network, and will continue to advance new security innovations in the future. Please 
read our white paper  on how our 5G network is designed, deployed and operated with 
security at its core.

Human capital
Moving the world forward together 
Every day, our over 133,000-strong V Team works to provide trusted and useful 
solutions to our customers while building a culture that is inclusive and rewarding  
for everyone, helping make Verizon a great place to work.
Verizon is committed to a workplace free from unlawful discrimination and harassment 
and will not tolerate discriminatory or harassing behavior of any kind. Our zero-tolerance 
policy applies to any conduct that has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, 
hostile or offensive work environment. All Verizon employees are expected to participate 
in civil treatment training intended to reinforce the company’s commitment to a diverse, 
hospitable work environment. 
Any employee who believes they have been the subject of, or is aware of, discrimination, 
harassment or retaliation can report this in a number of ways—to their supervisor, to the 
local human resources department or to Verizon Ethics  at http://www.verizonethics.com/ . 
Complaints are handled in a confidential manner, and information is shared only on a 
need-to-know basis. All complaints are investigated and any acts of discrimination, 
harassment or retaliation are addressed and remedied with appropriate corrective 
action, up to and including termination of employment. In addition, Verizon prohibits 
any form of retaliation against employees who file these types of complaints, and 
committing an act of retaliation alone can be cause for appropriate corrective action, 
including termination of employment. Verizon Ethics  is available 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week, and can accommodate calls in numerous languages.
The Verizon Credo 
Our Credo  guides our actions and empowers our decision-making as we work toward 
building a business that is purposeful and accountable for its social and environmental 
responsibility. The Verizon Credo provides an aspirational foundation and defines who 
we are and how we work, along with our core values of integrity, respect, performance 
excellence, personal accountability and social responsibility.
Employee compensation and benefits 
Compensation
Verizon’s comprehensive benefits plan includes competitive base pay, incentives 
and a robust 401(k) savings plan that matches 6% of eligible pay. Benefits for 
union-represented employees are governed by the applicable collective bargaining 
agreements, and benefits for employees outside the U.S. vary by jurisdiction. Verizon Ethics

Supporting V T eamers during the COVID-19 pandemic
In 2020, our employees across the company came together in new ways in response  
to the health and humanitarian crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon  
after COVID-19 was first identified, we took many broad-ranging steps to support  
our employees and their families so that the company could continue providing our 
essential services to our customers and communities. Some of these measures 
included temporarily moving over 115,000 of our employees to remote work arrangements 
and temporarily closing nearly 70% of our company-owned retail store locations or 
moving to appointment-only store access; limiting our customer-focused field operations 
for a period of time; enhancing safety protocols for employees working outside their 
homes; launching a COVID-19 leave of absence policy and expanded family care 
assistance for employees; and providing additional compensation to employees in  
front-line roles that could not be done from home for a period of time.
In addition, we re-trained  approximately 20,000 front-line employees to temporarily 
serve in other roles, such as customer service or telesales, which not only promoted 
the health and safety of our employees, but also provided opportunities for learning  
and career development.
In an effort to foster transparency and provide support during this unprecedented 
time, we launched a daily live webcast with current information on the company’s 
actions to address the impacts of COVID-19, as well as a number of broad-ranging 
resources for employees.
Verizon remains committed to supporting our employees throughout this challenging time. 
Information about health and safety, response plans, policy changes and compensation 
updates is also communicated to our V Teamers regularly through multiple channels, 
including a V Team Coronavirus Resource Page  and Verizon’s COVID-19 Employee 
Information  page. This centralized hub provides updates to all our stakeholders from 
leadership and human resources as they become available, as well as reminding 
employees of existing helpful resources available to them, including those related  
to mental health support.62

Diversity and inclusion
One of our foremost objectives as an organization is to create a collaborative, inclusive 
and diverse environment—within Verizon, with our customers and among our business 
partners and suppliers. 
We view this commitment as more than the right thing to do—it is a business imperative 
and a competitive advantage. Diversity and inclusion is how we achieve success. By 
celebrating diversity across all spectrums, including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity, 
national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, 
veteran/military status and age, we are a stronger company and culture. We are proud to 
receive multiple recognitions for diversity and inclusion; please see our full list of awards . 
Linking diversity to compensation
Verizon has a long history of incorporating ESG goals into management employees’ 
incentive compensation. Our short-term incentive plan has included a performance 
measure related to promoting workforce diversity for over 20 years. From 2014 through 
2019 the ESG metric made up 5% of the total short-term incentive award and was tied 
to workforce diversity, supplier diversity and environmental sustainability.
In early 2020, in order to strengthen our corporate purpose and culture, the Human 
Resources Committee of Verizon’s Board increased the weighting of the ESG factors to 
10% of the total STI award for corporate employees—including our CEO, Hans Vestberg. 
Pay equity
One of the ways we live up to our commitment to an inclusive workplace is by paying 
all employees performing similar work equitably. Our goal is to have 100% pay equity 
annually in salary for women and men globally, as well as with respect to race/ethnicity 
in the U.S.
In 2020, across all of Verizon, we had 100% pay equity in salary for women and men.  
In the U.S., we also had 100% pay equity in salary with respect to race/ethnicity. 
Consistent with our Commitment to Pay Equity , we remain committed to:
• Identifying and promoting best practices in compensation, hiring, promotion and 
career development.
• Developing strategies to reduce unconscious bias.
• Making hiring, promotion and compensation decisions that promote pay equity.Commitment

included a

plan for  
20+ years.69
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportSocial Environmental Governance Appendix Community SASB index Approach
In support of this commitment, Verizon has removed from our employment applications 
all questions seeking current or past salary information. We use language analytics 
software to scan our job postings to leverage inclusive language. We also provide hiring 
managers with training and structured interview guides to reduce the potential for bias 
in hiring decisions. In addition to unconscious bias training for all employees, we also 
provide managers with reminders regarding mitigating unconscious bias before they 
conduct performance reviews and interviews.
Training and partnerships
We continue to invest in the growth of women and people of color on the V Team. 
Among our most successful initiatives:
Women of the World (WOW).  A 12-month development program that energizes and 
empowers women by increasing leadership capabilities and enhancing a culture  
of inclusion and belonging. The program is built around core competencies critical  
to leadership.
Competitive Edge.  A program that supports the development of Verizon’s employees, 
targeting diverse talent. The program fosters leadership development and networking 
with senior leaders.
We offer in-person and online training to help all V Teamers understand the tools to 
mitigate bias and support conscious inclusion. Additionally, Verizon sponsors multiple 
diversity-focused organizations to build our employer brand and recruit diverse talent. 
These conferences and partnerships include: 
• Grace Hopper 
• Society of Women Engineers 
• National Society of Black Engineers
• Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers
• Great Minds in STEM (Hispanic Engineering National Achievement  
Award Conference)
• Out and Equal
• Disability:IN
Women in Technology and Entrepreneurship (WiTNY) 
Verizon is a founding sponsor of WiTNY, a collaborative initiative with Cornell Tech, 
the City University of New York (CUNY) and other industry partners, which propels 
women—from high school through graduate school—into rewarding tech careers with 
programs focused on education, work experience and community building. We partner 
on a number of initiatives, including the “winternship” program—three-week internships 
for college freshmen and sophomores during their winter break.70

adfellows  
The adfellows program is an eight-month marketing fellowship in which participants rotate 
through Verizon, agency partners and brand partners to gain both client and agency 
experience and to promote diversity of thought in the marketing industry. In May 2020,  
34 adfellows graduated from the program. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, 97% of  
the cohort obtained full-time roles in marketing or advertising after graduation. Due to 
the pandemic, the launch of the fourth class was postponed from September 2020  
to January 2021. The 2021 class will be held virtually with 24 participating agency  
and brand partners. Since 2017, 82 adfellows have graduated from the program.
Commitment to racial justice
This year, Verizon took a number of steps to support our employees and ensure 
everyone feels valued, respected and heard. 
Oversight
Our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion starts with our Board of Directors. 
Verizon’s Board discusses diversity and inclusion multiple times a year, including as 
it relates to employee engagement, development and compensation, and reviews 
workforce diversity data. 
Three of Verizon’s diverse directors spoke directly to Verizon employees about their 
own experiences and insights via our public daily webcast, Up to Speed. The directors’ 
discussions touched on the importance of racial and ethnic diversity in our workforce 
and on our Board, as well as racial justice in our communities. 
Building a strong organization
In summer 2020, we created an internal task force of senior leaders who meet regularly 
to advance our strategy for racial justice.  
One way Verizon is supporting our employees is through expanded learning and 
development opportunities, including a “Racial Equity and Justice Learning Plan”  
that provides V Teamers with resources that present a range of viewpoints to foster 
discussion, support informed, empathetic conversations, provide ideas about influencing 
change and help learners understand the importance of the language used when talking 
about racial equity and justice. 
V Teamers managing people are provided with additional resources including:  
• Ally Skills training
• A Racial Equity and Justice FAQ resource to help managers respond to questions 
and reinforce the importance of racial equity and justice
• Resources for team conversationsSince 2017,  
82 adfellows 
have graduated 
from the 
program.71
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportSocial Environmental Governance Appendix Community SASB index Approach
Partnerships
We are expanding national partnerships with high school, campus and professional 
organizations to grow the diversity of our applicant pools. We engage year-round with 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) through executive sponsor and 
brand ambassador programs. We are also leveraging Verizon’s BOLD (Black Originators 
Leaders and Doers) Employee Resource Group (ERG) to help identify and introduce 
diverse talent for future job openings through diversity recruitment events. 
Continuing the conversation
In response to employee requests that we continue to find ways to keep the conversation 
going, we created a Race & Social Justice Action Toolkit . This one-stop resource is 
available to all employees and provides access to a range of learning materials, including 
video interviews with Black leaders across the company, Verizon’s #Next20 series, and 
recommendations for books, podcasts, films and other media. We created this virtual 
toolkit to provide a foundation for our employees’ education, and we will continue to 
update it with new resources to help us all listen, learn, act and improve.
Beyond these resources, Verizon offers opportunities to volunteer, take action and become  
an ally within and outside our walls. Our ERGs have brought together people from every 
background in the company to engage in ongoing conversations to further explore these 
issues. On the 57th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s iconic “I have a dream” 
speech, BOLD sponsored a virtual march on Washington, achieving the greatest level  
of engagement to date. 
We are also piloting a new mentorship program, which we hope to scale to the whole 
company. In addition to our ERGs, V Teamers have access to numerous support groups 
through our Employee Assistance Program to discuss racial justice in a safe space.
Veterans
The rigor, teamwork and leadership exemplified by veterans comprise a great skill set for our 
business. That’s why we are proud of the veterans we hire through programs such as our 
Military Talent Network, which is specifically targeted to recruit veterans and access their 
diverse skill sets. In 2020, we hired 407 veterans. We’re proud to have more than 9,640 
veterans serving our customers. We also support military spouses with career guidance 
by connecting them to a military spouse recruiter. In 2020, we hired 145 military spouses. 
Our military leave policy allows our service members to continue serving their country 
when needed. When V Teamers are called up to active duty, we have a program that 
helps bridge the gap between military pay and Verizon pay to help care for their family 
members’ financial and health care needs. We are proud to receive multiple recognitions 
for our work with veterans; please see our full list of awards .
Hiring Our Heroes
We sponsor the Hiring Our Heroes Corporate Fellowship program, a U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce initiative that matches service members with participating companies to 
smooth the transition from military to civilian careers and assist military spouses with 
meaningful opportunities. We are also a Chairman’s Circle Member of the Chamber’s 
Veteran Employment Advisory Council. Learn more about our work with veterans and

Employee engagement 
Employee engagement survey
Our annual VZPulse+ employee engagement survey conducted by Gallup provides  
V Teamers with the opportunity to share confidential feedback on what’s working well 
and what we can improve to better support our teams. Anonymous, aggregated results 
are shared with V Teamers, and the results are used to drive our long-term action plans 
for how we can continue to better Verizon’s work culture. 
 
The 2020 Verizon Pulse+ survey achieved an employee participation rate of 85%. 
Our results ranked in the 75th percentile in overall employee engagement and 88th 
percentile in overall satisfaction compared to Gallup’s companywide database. Our 
results indicate that compared to other organizations, Verizon’s culture is more caring, 
providing employees with frequent recognition and regular progress discussions.
Employee resource groups
As a technology leader, we are keenly aware of the power of networks and of  
our responsibility to nurture an inclusive culture that celebrates the diversity of  
our V Team. Our global ERGs are an important channel to drive engagement, with 
members often becoming de facto ambassadors of diversity, equity and inclusion 
across Verizon. We have numerous ERGs, each with its own mission. All work  
together toward four common objectives:
• Career:  providing dynamic programming for employee professional development. 
• Customer:  providing a forum for employees to collaborate to help the company 
deliver great customer experiences in all market segments. 
• Community:  fostering economic inclusion, volunteerism, community engagement and 
positive change.
• Culture:  building an inclusive company culture where everyone can thrive, express 
their uniqueness, experience a sense of belonging and contribute to the business. 
ERGs champion and celebrate our differences and our similarities. By collaborating 
through ERGs, V Teamers bring their whole and authentic selves to work and contribute 
their unique perspectives to solving complex challenges both within and outside the 
workplace. Knowing their voices are heard and their work is valued, they find a strong 
sense of belonging, and harnessing this passion enables Verizon to be an employer of 
choice and a leader in the industry. We want every member of the V Team to bring their 
best selves and feel included at work every day.

Employee volunteerism
Our V Team members enthusiastically give back through donations and volunteer 
efforts throughout the year. V Teamers play a critical role in caring for the communities 
and causes that are aligned with our Citizen Verizon commitments. Verizon volunteers 
offer their time and skills across our three focus areas of digital inclusion, climate 
protection and human prosperity. We have made a bold commitment to dedicate  
2.5 million volunteer hours by 2025. 
This past year, we witnessed COVID-19 cause deeper disruptions for our most 
vulnerable community members, and our V Teamers stepped up to help virtually.  
This included supporting virtual food drives and virtually tutoring underprivileged 
middle and high school students. Since November 2019, V Teamers collectively 
volunteered over 529,000 hours supporting their communities.
Matching gifts
The Verizon Foundation matches V Teamers’ donations up to $1,000 for personal 
charitable donations and up to an additional $5,000 for donations to eligible higher 
education institutions. Additionally, employees who volunteer at least 50 hours at 
eligible nonprofits during a calendar year can generate a $750 donation from the 
Verizon Foundation for up to two organizations, totaling a benefit of $1,500. During 
2020, the Verizon Foundation provided $7.2 million in matching donations through 
these programs.
Pro Bono program 
Our Pro Bono program embodies Verizon’s long-standing commitment to social 
responsibility. Year after year, we make a huge difference in the lives of individuals  
in need of assistance: survivors of domestic violence, veterans seeking their rightful 
benefits and immigrants seeking to uphold their rights under the law. Our volunteers 
have provided valuable legal guidance to nonprofits, enabling them to meet their 
obligations and focus on their missions. And, we have mentored students from 
disadvantaged communities across the U.S. and abroad to help them become  
better students and show them the possibilities of careers at places like Verizon.
In 2020, we expanded our program to support social justice efforts, including assisting 
clients facing eviction due to COVID-19, and civic and community engagement to 
address racial injustice around the world.In 2020,

Learning and development
Verizon provides training and development at every level to help V Teamers enhance 
their skills and advance their careers. We provide employees with learning solutions 
that inspire, engage and enable them with the knowledge and capabilities needed  
today and tomorrow to deliver great customer experiences; drive revenue, growth  
and profitability; improve shareholder value and contribute to society.
Learning culture
Verizon’s learning culture includes continuous, purposeful learning that develops  
V Teamers to their full potential through top-notch learning programs and exceptional 
development experiences. In 2020, we invested $203.6 million in learning and 
development initiatives for our employees.
Upskilling and reskilling
Verizon’s Learning Portal 2.0, powered by Degreed, is a lifelong learning platform that 
delivers personalized, curated, on-demand content supported by social collaboration. 
We partner with LinkedIn Learning, Pluralsight, Harvard ManageMentor and others  
to enhance employee skills through videos, articles, books, group collaboration and  
online training. 
The Portal allows for the creation of learning pathways for all employees (e.g., navigating 
change, Racial Equity and Justice), functional specific pathways to build technical and 
leadership skills (e.g., global technology solutions transformation) and certification 
preparation for personal development and business requirements. With new learning 
pathways and premium content providers, Learning Portal 2.0 is constantly evolving to 
help our employees grow and succeed.
In response to store closures, customer needs and other restrictions resulting from the 
COVID-19 pandemic, Verizon reskilled and retrained approximately 20,000 V Teamers 
to temporarily serve in other roles from their own homes. We also set up an internal 
staff marketplace where organizations within the company can draw on employees 
from other areas if they need support. These efforts have allowed us to continue to 
serve our customers while broadening employment opportunities for our employees. 
Emerging technology use
As a technology company, we leverage emerging tech solutions to enrich and maximize 
the impact of our learning programs. Examples include:  
• Virtual reality and augmented reality programs on store safety, customer interactions 
and technical processes.
• Virtual instructor-led training through our engaging and interactive Adobe Connect 11.0.5 
platform, which brings employees together from around the globe.
• Learning reinforcement through the Allego app, a video-based reinforcement tool 
that helps our learners retain knowledge with bite-sized content.In 2020,  
we invested 
$203.6 million 
in learning and

Tuition assistance
V Teamers are provided up to $8,000 annually through our Global Tuition Assistance 
Program to fund higher education studies from a wide range of accredited schools. In 
2020, more than 8,800 V Teamers took advantage of our tuition assistance program. 
Verizon invested nearly $39 million in this program in 2020.
Safety
Certification
Verizon’s culture of safety begins with our be SAFE principles—be Smart, Aware, Focused 
and Equipped. These principles emphasize keeping V Teamers safe at work, at home and 
on the road. We maintain certification to Safety Schemes in Procurement (SSiP) in some 
markets and the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001 
certification and are transitioning to ISO 45001.
Training
We regularly update our employee health and safety programs, including online and 
instructor-led training to educate employees about best practices and working safely. 
Topics include operating aerial lifts, splicing fiber, climbing poles, handling ladders and 
installing fiber.
In 2020, our occupational injuries and illnesses rate was 1.02 per 100 employees, well 
below the Bureau of Labor Statistics telecommunications industry average of 2.4. We 
are committed to maintaining a safe workplace and environmentally responsible work 
practices, and we expect our suppliers—who play a critical role in our success—to 
share that commitment.V T eamers can

Labor relations
We have a long history of working with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) 
and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW)—the two unions that in 
total represent approximately 22.5% of our employees as of December 31, 2020. The 
collective bargaining agreements covering our union-represented employees who serve 
customers in our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast service areas extend through August 5, 2023. 
We regularly meet with national and local union leaders of the CWA and IBEW to talk 
about key business topics, including issues such as safety, customer service, plans 
to improve operational processes, our business performance and the impacts that 
changing technology and competition are having on our customers, employees and 
business strategy.
Our dialogue with our unions on these issues is constructive and has been especially 
robust during the current COVID-19 crisis. At the onset of the pandemic, we worked with 
our unions to shift our union-represented customer service and sales representatives  
to a work-from-home model and to implement new dispatch and garage protocols for 
installation and maintenance technicians, resulting in some technicians being able to 
keep their work vehicles at remote locations, such as their homes, to support social 
distancing. For both union-represented employees and employees not represented by 
unions, we provided a temporary pay enhancement to those who continued to deploy 
outside their homes to meet critical customer needs.
We respect our employee’s right to engage in concerted, protected activity. Informed by 
the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights 
at Work, as well as the United Nations Global Compact, we respect our employees’ 
rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in compliance with applicable 
law, including the right to join or not join worker organizations (labor unions). 
For all of our employees—whether or not they are represented by a union—we focus 
on providing competitive wages and valuable benefits that rate among the best in our 
industry. We train our local managers and supervisors on our open door policy designed 
to respect and redress through the appropriate processes any individual issues and 
concerns raised by employees.77
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportSocial Environmental Governance Appendix Community SASB index Approach
Verizon spent $64 billion with external suppliers during the 12 months ended 
November 30, 2020. Our suppliers range from the world’s largest original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs) to smaller providers of equipment and services. 
Supplier Code of Conduct  
We expect our suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct , which means 
acting with integrity, obeying all applicable health, safety, labor and environmental laws 
and protecting confidential and proprietary information.
Verizon views it as a business imperative to uphold the human rights of workers by 
treating them with dignity and respect, and we expect the same commitment from 
suppliers. Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets forth our expectations for our suppliers, 
and includes provisions that:
• Forbid the use of child labor, forced labor and discrimination.
• Protect employees’ rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, as 
permitted by local laws.
• Prohibit discrimination on any basis prohibited by applicable/local law, including, 
without limitation, race, color, religion, age, gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, 
gender identity and expression, national origin, disability, marital status, citizenship 
status, veteran status or military status.
Verizon reserves the right to review or audit our suppliers’ compliance with the Supplier 
Code. We also incorporate ongoing compliance into our business relationships and 
procurement decisions. Our complete Supplier Code of Conduct  is available online.Our Supplier 
Code of Conduct

conduct in the

Supplier engagement
We are committed to working with our suppliers with the shared goal of responsible 
business conduct throughout our supply chain. We engage our suppliers to promote 
social and environmental responsibility, including protection for the rights of workers, 
through a number of channels. 
EcoVadis
In 2020, we continued our partnership with EcoVadis. Verizon uses EcoVadis’ 
assessment tool to evaluate our suppliers’ responsible performance. We monitor  
and assess supplier performance in four areas:
• Environment
• Labor and human rights
• Ethics
• Sustainable procurement
Since 2013, we have assessed 500 key suppliers through this partnership. EcoVadis 
validates suppliers’ responses to their detailed questionnaire and researches 
information from other public sources to benchmark suppliers on their performance. 
When weaknesses are identified, we work with the supplier to create a corrective 
action plan to improve their current activities. Both Verizon and our supplier benefit 
from this partnership.
We met our corporate goal of 80% of our assessed suppliers being compliant with our 
supplier responsibility standards by the end of 2020. We are furthering our commitment 
to supplier engagement by committing to both assess and reach compliance for suppliers 
comprising 80% of our 2020 sourceable spend* by 2026.
 
*Excluding amounts paid to Apple Inc.
Joint Audit Cooperation
Verizon is a member of the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC), an association of telecom 
operators that collaboratively audits common vendors and looks for opportunities to 
improve supplier responsibility across our industry. 
This furthers our efforts to understand not only what our suppliers are pledging through 
their policies but also to survey on-site performance. 728 supplier audits have been 
completed since JAC’s inception in 2010, and 89 of them were completed in 2020.
Verizon joined JAC in 2013 as the first U.S.-based member. Other members include 
AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telecom Italia, Proximus, KPN, Rogers, Swisscom, 
Telefónica, Telenor, Telia Company and Vodafone.79

Avetta
Verizon works with Avetta, an external qualifier of supply-chain risk, to review injury 
rates, environmental health and safety violations, fines, corrective actions and other 
environmental and safety performance metrics for our suppliers working in areas 
most prone to environmental and safety risks. Avetta compares our data to industry 
benchmarks. When weaknesses are identified, Verizon works with our contractors to 
plan corrective actions. By the end of 2020, Verizon screened the EHS performance 
of more than 2,700 suppliers and discontinued business with more than 500 suppliers 
that did not meet Verizon’s EHS criteria.
Supplier Risk Office
Verizon’s Supplier Risk Management Program supports the company’s overall commitment 
to responsible sourcing. Established in 2018, and managed by a dedicated team in Verizon’s 
Supplier Risk Office, the program enables the company to identify, assess, monitor and 
manage a range of supply chain-related risks, including those that may be associated 
with the social and environmental impacts of supplier activity. 
The Supplier Risk Office works closely with other teams throughout the company, including 
Sourcing, Business Risk, Sustainability, Business & Human Rights and Compliance to 
implement a risk management framework that allows the company to continually assess 
and manage supplier-related risks. This work happens throughout the supplier life cycle, 
including: planning, due diligence, contracting, ongoing monitoring and termination. The 
Supplier Risk Office is responsible for program oversight, coordination and support to 
stakeholders throughout Verizon. 
Supplier diversity
We operate a robust set of supplier diversity and economic inclusion initiatives that 
include designed collaboration with executive champions from across our business.  
By valuing diversity and inclusion in our supply chain, we position ourselves to deliver 
the technology that matters to our customers in a multicultural world.
Over the 12 months ended November 30, 2020, we spent nearly $5.7 billion in goods 
and services with diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, 
women, veterans, LGBTQ and people with disabilities. This brings our total spend to 
more than $50 billion over the past 10 years.
Verizon is a charter member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR), a coalition of  
28 companies that spend more than $1 billion each year with diverse suppliers. 
Our supplier diversity framework is based on strong leadership, and we’re proud to have 
earned numerous supplier diversity and inclusion awards. Please see our Awards and 
recognition  page to learn more.Verizon has a long 
history of partnering

trafficking within our business operations and supply chain. Verizon is engaged in an 
ongoing assessment of the nature and extent of our exposure to the risk of modern 
slavery by reviewing, with our supervisory procurement personnel, areas of Verizon’s 
supply chain that may be higher risk. In addition, our Business Risk Team is trained in 
relation to modern slavery and human trafficking risk and carries out reputational risk 
due diligence on new and existing vendors. Where they identify information that could 
be a risk factor, they raise that to the Supplier Risk Office and appropriate legal teams 
for review. We describe our efforts in our U.K. M odern Slavery Act Statement  and 
Australia Modern Slavery Act Statement .
Conflict minerals
We encourage our partners to take steps to verify that their products do not include 
materials that either directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (or in any adjoining country). Through Verizon’s 
membership in GeSI, we are working with other companies to identify several “clean” 
(conflict-free) sources for tantalum, an important conflict mineral used in various 
electronics, and to support pilot “bag and tag” programs that can add crucial visibility 
on a mineral’s ultimate source.
Verizon also joined the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA), 
a joint initiative of the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Agency for International 
Development, private sector companies and trade associations, civil society and the 
International Conference on the Great Lakes Region. The PPA works to collectively call 
for action to address conflict minerals concerns while delivering solutions that benefit 
those involved in responsible minerals trade in the Democratic Republic of Congo and 
the Great Lakes Region of Central Africa. Our Conflict Mineral Policy  contains more 
information on our approach to this issue.U.K. Modern Slavery

Citizen Verizon
This year, to move the world forward through action, we launched Citizen Verizon , our 
responsible business plan for economic, environmental and social advancement. Taking 
on the role of a citizen of the world with a responsibility to drive impact, Citizen Verizon 
lays out how we will leverage our resources, technology and employees to benefit our 
communities. Citizen Verizon focuses on three key areas where we believe we can have 
the greatest impact: Digital Inclusion, Climate Protection and Human Prosperity. To hold 
ourselves accountable to making a difference in these key areas, we have set ambitious 
goals against which we will measure our progress. 
Three key areas:
Digital Inclusion:
Address barriers to digital inclusion 
and enable connectivity for those 
who need it most.Goals:
•  10 million youths provided with digital skills 
training by 2030.
•  1 million small businesses provided with 
resources to help them thrive in the digital 
economy by 2030.
Climate Protection:
Reduce the impact of our direct 
operations and innovate to minimize 
climate impact on communities.Goal:
•  Achieve net zero emissions in our operations  
by 2035.
Human Prosperity:
Create opportunity for individuals 
and communities to thrive and 
responsibly grow our business.Goals:
•  500,000 individuals prepared for jobs of the 
future by 2030.
•  2.5 million employee hours committed  
to volunteerism by 2025.83

Digital Inclusion
T ackling the digital divide
For many, it is hard to imagine living our day-to-day lives without access to the internet 
and the information, resources and ability to connect with our family, friends and 
colleagues across the globe that it affords us. But far too many people are missing out 
on the opportunities of the digital economy because they lack reliable, affordable 
internet access or face challenges using technology. We are working hard to tackle this 
issue from every angle:
• Access:  Expanding broadband access in underserved areas, including rural areas, 
by leveraging our networks and technology.
• Affordability:  Developing products and services that are usable and affordable.
• Application:  Promoting digital access and literacy with innovative programs directed 
at underserved communities, and providing accessible products and services.
• Advocacy:  Advocating for holistic and broad solutions to address the digital divide 
and championing accessibility. 
Access
Verizon’s consumer business provides wireless communications services across one of 
the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. and wireline communications services 
in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington, D.C.  
The challenges of deploying home broadband in rural areas, including rough terrain  
and low-density population levels, have created barriers to private investment, leaving 
too many people in rural America without reliable internet service. 
A decade ago, we launched our LTE in Rural America program to accelerate the rollout 
and adoption of 4G LTE services in rural areas. Under this innovative program, we have 
provided support and resources to help rural wireless carriers build out and operate 
their own LTE networks and, through reciprocal roaming arrangements, extend the 
footprint of LTE coverage for both the rural carriers’ and Verizon Wireless’ customers. 
While we are proud to have made 4G LTE service – which provides mobile internet 
access that is sufficient for many purposes – available to the vast majority of rural 
residents across the country, we have seen that it does not always provide enough 
bandwidth to support the multiuser demands of a household today, such as distance 
learning, remote work and entertainment.84
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportCommunity Social Environmental Governance Appendix SASB index Approach
This year, leveraging capacity on our nationwide 4G LTE network, we launched a new 
fixed mobile service offering designed to provide more dependable and affordable 
internet access for consumers in rural areas. Available in parts of 189 markets across 
48 states to customers residing outside our Fios and 5G footprints, Verizon LTE Home 
offers unlimited broadband access with speeds averaging about 25 Mbps, which can 
support distance learning, remote work and more. 
We have also been deploying fiber to homes in rural areas of upstate New York with 
support from New York’s broadband program and to homes in the mid-Atlantic region with 
support from the FCC’s Connect America Fund. We recognize that there is much more 
work to be done to bring usable and affordable internet access to our rural communities.
Affordability
Too many people today have difficulty paying for home broadband connectivity and the 
technology needed to access it. Many choose mobile options in lieu of home broadband, 
often due to the cost of subscription. According to the Pew Foundation, 27% of adults do 
not subscribe to fixed or home (i.e., not mobile) broadband; half of those nonsubscribers 
said they do not subscribe to home broadband because of cost1.
 
As businesses shuttered across the country in March 2020 and many Americans became 
unemployed, Verizon signed the FCC’s Keep Americans Connected Pledge, committing 
to not terminate service or charge late fees for customers who notified us of their inability 
to pay their bills due to disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. We also 
automatically added 15GB of high speed data for wireless consumer and small business 
customers with no customer action necessary. We extended the Pledge through June, 
and in July we automatically enrolled customers who had signed up for the Pledge in 
our extended repayment program to provide options for them to stay connected.
As the COVID-19 pandemic drove significant changes to remote work and learning, Verizon 
offered a special $20 per month discount on Fios broadband service to new low-income 
customers and waived the first 60 days of router rental charges. We’ve now formalized 
that discounted pricing into an ongoing low-income service offering, Fios Forward . Available 
to new and existing Lifeline-qualified customers, Fios Forward offers affordable access 
to high-performing broadband internet that can meet multiuser demands, including 
at-home learning, remote working and entertainment streaming. Eligible customers can 
purchase 200/200 Mbps internet with no data caps for $19.99 per month or apply the 
$20 per month discount to the Fios broadband tier that best suits their household’s needs. 
Recognizing the urgency for school districts to quickly and seamlessly secure 
connectivity for students to participate in remote learning, Verizon launched a new, 
national distance learning program that provides connectivity solutions at significantly 
discounted rates. Through the Verizon Distance Learning program , we have partnered 
with independent school districts and state departments of education to deliver 4G LTE 
wireless connectivity, devices and other solutions to students nationwide. The program 
provides K-12 institutions with reliable connectivity, devices (hotspots/MiFi units), mobile

device management and other security/compliance apps that school districts rely on to 
support distance learning. By year end, discounted internet access, devices and security 
solutions were available for purchase by school districts to support distance learning 
across 41 states and the District of Columbia, covering more than 38 million students.
Application
Verizon Innovative Learning – helping students bridge the digital divide
Digital inclusion is about making sure that the benefits of technology are realized by all. 
In the U.S., underresourced students continue to lack the connectivity, technology and 
skills required for success in today’s digital economy. That’s why we have been working 
to foster digital inclusion through a transformative educational program called Verizon 
Innovative Learning . It’s a key part of our mission to move the world forward for all 
through our Citizen Verizon plan. 
Through Verizon Innovative Learning, we bring technology and connectivity to 
underresourced students and work closely with nonprofit partners and a team  
of education and technology experts to build and administer technology-focused 
programs that not only expand the scope of students’ learning, but also prepare  
them for the jobs of the future from a young age.
Schools
Our Verizon Innovative Learning Schools program provides free technology, free internet 
access and technology-driven curriculum to help give students in underresourced middle 
schools and, beginning in 2020, high schools, the technology, education and opportunity 
they deserve. The program also provides ongoing professional development to teachers 
to support student learning with technology. 
Every student and teacher at a Verizon Innovative Learning school is equipped with a 
free device and up to a four-year data plan, giving more students the ability to achieve, 
learn and create both at home and in school. To support remote learning during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, we tripled the data allowances for participating students and 
teachers. We also expanded our schools model to provide hotspots to facilitate remote 
learning for students who have a school-issued device but lack reliable home internet 
access and launched the Teacher Training Pathways platform to support educators in 
implementing technology-integrated instruction.Verizon Innovative 
LearningLearn more86
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportCommunity Social Environmental Governance Appendix SASB index Approach
We added 111 schools in the 2020-2021 school year, bringing the total number of Verizon 
Innovative Learning schools to 264. Our goal is to reach 350 schools at the end of 2021.

Verizon Innovative Learning Labs
The Verizon Innovative Learning Labs program creates a custom-designed, state-of-the-art, 
experiential learning space within Verizon Innovative Learning schools. Powered by a 
next-gen, emerging technology-infused curriculum, including augmented reality, virtual 
reality and artificial intelligence, the Lab provides students with the opportunity to leverage 
technology, social innovation and design thinking to impact their communities.
5G-enabled learning
Our work to deploy 5G in schools has been significantly curtailed by the ongoing COVID-19 
pandemic. We remain committed to deploying 5G in schools to give our students and 
teachers the opportunity to be at the forefront of cutting-edge technology. 5G enables 
immersive experiences using virtual and augmented reality, as well as advanced low-
latency robotics which turn lesson plans into living, breathing, engaging experiences. 
STEM enrichment programs for young men of color and rural young women
Verizon Innovative Learning also offers project-based STEM learning experiences for 
middle school young men of color and rural young women in intensive summer camps, 
followed by weekly enrichment classes held year-round in Historically Black Colleges 
and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions and community colleges across the 
country. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 restrictions and for the health and safety of 
participants, these programs were suspended in 2020. 
Online teaching & learning resources
Verizon is providing free professional development for all K-12 educators through  
our Teacher Training Pathways platform. These self-guided courses aligned to 
microcredentials are designed to help teachers develop more effective remote  
and hybrid instruction. 
Additionally in 2020, Verizon enhanced the STEM Activity Center, a free online resource 
for students that provides hands-on STEM activities focused on virtual reality, augmented 
reality, 3D design and more.
With the launch of Citizen Verizon, we announced an ambitious new commitment to 
provide 10 million youths with the digital skills training necessary to thrive in a modern 
economy by 2030. Since 2014, Verizon has provided over 480,000 youths with digital 
skills training.88
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportCommunity Social Environmental Governance Appendix SASB index Approach
Supporting small businesses’ transition to the digital economy
Small businesses were significantly impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they 
faced store closures, reduced consumer spending and additional business restrictions. 
In 2020, Verizon launched multiple programs and campaigns  in support of small 
businesses as they had to find new and innovative ways to succeed. 
The coronavirus pandemic highlighted the importance of small businesses to have a digital 
presence and has arguably sped up the transition to a digital economy. We’re committed 
to supporting small businesses as they navigate this new way of operating now and in 
the years to come. Verizon has set a goal under Citizen Verizon to provide 1 million small 
businesses with the resources to help them thrive in the digital economy by 2030. 
Breaking down barriers through accessible products and services
Verizon is committed to providing products and services that are accessible to the 
broadest range of customers, including youth, seniors and individuals with disabilities. 
These initiatives are critical to our ongoing efforts to bridge the digital divide. Our work 
is ongoing as we continue to find ways to level the playing field by breaking down barriers, 
promoting greater representation and challenging stigmas that directly impact quality of life. 
Our services and tools are made for the way our customers communicate and include 
support like visual assistance, accessible content, auditory support and mobility tools. 
We continually test the accessibility of our products, using the same assistive technology 
as our users: closed captioning, switch control, on-screen keyboards, alternate-input 
devices and screen readers. 
Through our annual Accessibility Bug Bash, our product teams work to resolve 
accessibility bugs across our products. We operate Accessibility Labs in New York, 
Boston and Sunnyvale, California, to support this effort and to recognize outstanding 
employee contributions. Our cultural investment in accessibility helps to make our  
sites and apps usable for all, delivering a great customer experience.
To optimize the digital experience for all of our customers, we strive to meet the online 
accessibility standards recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in its 
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA. We take a number of steps to 
attempt to meet or exceed those standards:
• We use various assistive technologies across desktop, tablets, mobile devices and 
in-store to test against the WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
• We work with our ADVANCE (Advocates for Disability, Accessibility, Neurodiversity 
and Caregiver Empowerment) ERG, as well as industry partners, to remain informed 
about accessibility issues and to improve user experiences.
• We have a diverse and inclusive team of accessibility professionals who are 
continuously working to make each customer’s digital experience the best it can be.89
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportCommunity Social Environmental Governance Appendix SASB index Approach
Verizon provides a range of wireless and Fios TV accessible products and services for 
the elderly and people with disabilities, including:
• Hearing-aid-compatible phones
• Free 411 search
• Free directory assistance
• Support for real-time text (RTT)
• Fios TV text to speech
• Big button remote
• Descriptive video service (DVS)
• Fios TV guides and channel lineups in large print
Advocacy
Mobilizing stakeholders
We’re proud to provide the connectivity that’s keeping tens of millions of Americans 
educated, employed and informed, and of the initiatives we’ve undertaken to support 
low-income and underserved communities. But solving our nation’s broadband 
challenges will require even more. 
We need big ideas and collective action to accelerate the development of meaningful 
connectivity for everyone. That’s why our CEO stepped up to chair the World Economic 
Forum’s newly formed EDISON Alliance, which aims to mobilize industry sectors to 
quicken the pace of digital development and accelerate the opportunity for every 
person to participate in the digital economy. This is a critical moment for leaders from 
all sectors to prioritize these issues.
We have also proposed a new public policy approach in the U.S. as a supplement to  
the existing Lifeline and Connect America Fund programs that we call “ Accelerating 
America: Affordability—Adoption—Access .” We believe that Congress and the 
administration can take important steps to address these challenges, working with 
state and local public officials, nonprofits and industry toward a common goal of 
providing all Americans with affordable access.90
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportCommunity Social Environmental Governance Appendix SASB index Approach
Championing accessibility 
As technology continues to evolve and advance, we’re working hard to make sure that it 
does so for everyone. Verizon Media hosted the second annual XR Access Symposium  
virtually on July 20 in partnership with Cornell Tech, bringing together researchers, 
technologists and the disability community to lead the way in making Augmented 
Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and 360 video accessible. 
We’re also tackling the accessibility skills gap. Many businesses lack the workforce to 
execute accessible design and development because there are so few experts practicing 
in this area. We co-founded Teach Access , a coalition of top tech companies, major 
universities and leading advocacy organizations with a mission to infuse accessibility 
concepts and skills into higher education curriculum. Together, we empower students 
studying design, computer science and human-computer interaction with the knowledge 
necessary to help create a more inclusive and accessible world.
Verizon has long championed accessibility because we believe that all people should 
have access to new technologies and great content. This year, Verizon proudly joined 
The Valuable 500 , a coalition of the world’s largest businesses dedicated to driving 
greater disability inclusion. 
Verizon Media also continues to partner with The National Disability Leadership Alliance 
and Getty Images on expanding The Disability Collection, a collection of stock images 
that break stereotypes and authentically portray people with disabilities in everyday life. 
Verizon has made thousands of images available on gettyimages.com for worldwide 
license in the hope that it will help increase disability representation in media. Partnerships 
like these are essential to creating systemic change around accessibility and addressing 
previously unmet needs in the disability community. 
Verizon’s ADVANCE ERG is dedicated to helping the company and the world become 
universally accessible. In 2020, ADVANCE facilitated the launch of a Disability Awareness 
Toolkit for employees to explore the history of disability as a civil rights movement, 
understand why disability representation matters, and dive deeper into the intersection 
of race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation and disability. ADVANCE also amplified 
the voices of disability leaders and disability rights activists throughout 2020 through 
various content series, such as #Next20 and Yahoo! News’ In The Know.We are proud to 
join the Valuable 
500 to drive 
sustainable 
innovation and 
equitable growth 
with the expertise 
of the disability 
community at the 
forefront. 
Together, we can 
build a future 
where everyone  
is included.

Climate Protection
From sourcing renewable energy and partnering with reforestation projects to creating 
solutions that help customers save energy, we are committed to protecting our planet 
for future generations. Verizon has set ambitious goals around climate protection , 
including achieving net zero emissions in our operations by 2035. Our V Team is 
enthusiastically and actively engaged in our efforts to realize our goals and reduce 
our collective impact on the environment. 
We recently announced a $1 million grant to We Mean Business, a global coalition of 
nonprofit organizations working with the world’s most influential businesses to take 
action on climate change. The funding will help the We Mean Business coalition provide 
small- and medium-sized businesses globally with tech-enabled carbon footprint 
quantification tools and the necessary education to enable a 50% reduction of their 
carbon emissions by 2030.
For more information on our environmental commitments and initiatives, please see  
the Environmental  section.
Human Prosperity
Through extensive community-oriented programs and initiatives, Verizon strives to 
support people, regardless of their backgrounds or circumstances, with access to the 
resources and knowledge that will help them thrive in our increasingly digital world. 
Preparing individuals for jobs of the future
With the advancement of technology, our global workforce is becoming more digital. 
For many jobs today and moving forward, new skills are becoming increasingly critical 
for applicants to participate in the future economy.
Verizon has committed to prepare 500,000 individuals for jobs of the future by 2030, 
and since 2019, we have prepared over 4,200 people. We uplift individuals through 
skills training and job advancement tools. To help prepare the most vulnerable and 
underresourced communities for the jobs of the future, Verizon is:
• Providing job advancement programs that equip vulnerable populations with the 
skills and mentorship they need to enter the future economy. 
• Working in coalition with other companies to develop a suite of innovative 
technologies to scale and increase program efficiency.
• Developing collaborative partnerships to advance the conversation around  
skills-based hiring. 92
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportCommunity Social Environmental Governance Appendix SASB index Approach
This commitment builds on Verizon’s upskilling and tech training programs  for  
our employees.
In support of these efforts, we directed $44 million toward a reskilling program to help 
individuals prepare for better jobs. While it’s open to all individuals, the program is 
prioritizing traditionally marginalized populations, including Black and Latinx, as well as 
individuals who are currently unemployed and/or without a four-year degree. The program 
began in Dallas, Seattle and Miami and will be expanding to more locations in 2021.
Volunteerism at Verizon
Now, more than ever, the world needs all the good we can offer. While Verizon has a 
strong scorecard and rich legacy when it comes to doing right for the greater good, 
Citizen Verizon is how we intend to double-down our efforts, lead the way and deepen 
our impact.
Verizon employees have long been committed to donating their time to their communities. 
Our V Team has made a bold commitment to dedicate 2.5 million volunteer hours  by 
2025 to make an impact in the areas of digital inclusion, climate protection and human 
prosperity. While no one person can change the world on their own, each individual action 
will be matched by the strength of our more than 133,000 employees.
Community investment
Natural disaster relief
Verizon is always prepared to support our customers and first responders during 
emergency situations. 
In 2020, we helped millions of people impacted by events like the California and 
Colorado wildfires and Hurricane Laura. After major natural disasters, our Verizon 
Response Team is on-site and available 24/7 to provide our customers with the 
resources they need to get back on their feet and reconnect with the people who 
matter most. 
Customers can also access real-time information and updates on Verizon’s relief and 
recovery efforts through our Emergency Resource Center, where we also share tips 
and resources to prepare you for potential natural disasters. For current information on 
Verizon’s emergency response efforts, please visit our Emergency Resource Center .
 
Supporting our communities during COVID-19  
From the start of the pandemic, Verizon and the Verizon Foundation supported our 
communities, enabling vital connectivity and donating services and funds to organizations 
that are best suited to support impacted individuals and small businesses. Verizon’s total 
COVID-19 crisis commitment stands at over $55 million in contributions and donations 
to nonprofits around the globe.93
Verizon 2020 ESG ReportCommunity Social Environmental Governance Appendix SASB index Approach
As a vital provider of the world’s critical communications infrastructure, we know that our 
strength lies in connecting people during critical times, and COVID-19 was no different. 
We enabled connectivity at multiple federal, state and local mobile command centers to 
accelerate testing at critical remote testing sites. We supported first responders with 
priority and preemption abilities for voice and data, as well as providing connectivity to 
the Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort which deployed to New York City. 
We also supported critical relief efforts through in-kind donations, ranging from 
advertising inventory on Verizon Media platforms to support mental health and public 
health response efforts to providing free chargers to nonprofit hospitals to ensure 
patients could stay connected with loved ones. We also provided meals to doctors, 
nurses and medical staff through our “Food for the Frontline Workers” program.
To aid COVID-19 relief, the Verizon Foundation made contributions to organizations such 
as the Center for Disaster Philanthropy COVID-19 Response Fund and Direct Relief, both 
centered on supporting health care workers on the front lines, as well as the World Health 
Organization, the UN Foundation Solidarity Response Fund and a group of international 
countries and charities offering health care support and food relief. 
While the impact of the coronavirus pandemic was different for every person and every 
business, we saw certain communities hit harder than others. Small business owners, 
for example, suffered significantly from the economic downturn that accompanied store 
closures and reduced consumer spending. Verizon took action early on to support them 
with the launch of Pay it Forward Live, a weekly streaming entertainment series that 
included music, gaming, comedy and more in support of small businesses affected by 
COVID-19. In parallel, the Verizon Foundation donated $7.5 million to the Local Initiatives 
Support Corporation (LISC) with a specific focus on supporting small businesses in 
underserved communities, including Black-owned small businesses. 
We took other actions to support small businesses, including:  
• Establishing a free small business webinar series with practical, actionable insights 
and tips from experts.
• Launching a mentoring program for women entrepreneurs and business owners 
affected by COVID-19.
• Partnering with Hello Alice, a platform that supports underrepresented small 
business owners, to offer resources and mentorship for small businesses. 
• Making Yahoo Business Maker free for one year to help businesses get online  
with a web domain, business email addresses, support and more. 
Verizon Business also launched a small business resource hub to bring together all of 
the relief programs, resources and vital information so that they can be easily located 
by those affected by the pandemic.

Advocating for racial justice 
Verizon has a long track record of support for diversity, equity and inclusion, and we 
are a champion of social justice organizations. We believe these issues are core to our 
corporate values and essential to our success as a company now and in the future. 
This past year, we witnessed a turning point in how Americans and the world beyond 
our borders acknowledge racial injustices. We collectively recognize that these are not 
isolated incidents, but rather reflect centuries of systemic inequality that must be rooted 
out in order for everyone in our community to have equal rights and opportunities, to 
feel safe and valued, and to have their voices heard in both the workplace and our 
public domain. 
Following the unjust death of George Floyd, Verizon reaffirmed our commitment  
to racial justice . Verizon and the Verizon Foundation donated $10 million to seven 
social justice organizations, many of whom have been our long-standing partners. We

Verizon 2020 ESG ReportSASB index Community Social Environmental Governance Appendix Approach
SASB index 
For the year ended December 31, 2020
Updated August 2021
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is an independent, standards 
setting organization that has developed voluntary industry-specific standards for 
companies to disclose consistent and decision-useful environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) information for investors. We share SASB’s stated vision of global 
capital markets in which a shared understanding of sustainability performance enables 
companies and investors to make informed decisions that drive long-term va lue creation 
and better outcomes for businesses and their shareholders, the global economy and 
society at large. And we are committed to providing investors with relevant, high-quality 
disclosures that d emonstrate the val ue Verizon creates through the effe ctive management 
of the ESG issues that impact our business.
For 2020 we are expanding Verizon’s reporting of our ESG performance with reference 
to the SASB framework. This report provides information with respect to the disclosure 
topics and accounting metrics in the two SASB industry  standards  that are most relevant 
to our business: Telecommunicati on S ervices and Internet Med ia & Se rvices. In the 
following tables, quantitative  data is followed by narrative informatio n that contextualizes 
the data where appropriate and is also responsive to any qualitative metrics. 
Unless otherwise indicated, quantitative data is provided as of or for the years ended 
December 31, 2020 and 2019, where available. Verizon seeks independent assurance 
for select ESG data, including our emissions profile, each year. Please r ead Verizon’s 
Independent Accountants’ Review Reports for more information. We will update this 
report to include the 2020 metrics that are currently undergoing independent 
assurance when the Independent Accountants’ Review Report with respect to those 
metrics has been issued.
The inclusion of information in this report should not be construed as a characterization 
regarding the materiality or financial impact of that information. Please see our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and other publicly filed 
documents, which are available a t https: //www.verizon.com /about/investors/. 
Note on Nonfinancial Reporting: Nonfinancial information is subject to measurement 
uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature of, and the methods used 
for determining, such data. The selection of di fferent but acceptable measurement 
techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of di fferent 
measurement techniques may also vary.96

TC-TL-000.ANumber of wireless retail connections* 120,880,000 119,692,000
Wireless retail connections are retail customer device postpaid and prepaid connections as of the end of the period. 
Retail connections under an account may include those from smartphones and basic phones, as well as tablets and other internet devices, including wearables and retail IoT devices. Wireless retail connections are calculated by adding total retail postpaid and prepaid new connections in the period to prior period retail connections, and subtracting total retail postpaid and prepaid disconnects in the period.
TC-TL-000.BNumber of voice connections* 9,714,000 10,713,000
Voice connections are the total number of traditional switched access lines in service and Fios digital voice connections as of the end of the period. 
TC-TL-000.CNumber of broadband connections* 7,129,000 6,956,000
Broadband connections are the total number of connections to the internet using Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and Fios internet services as of the end of the period. Broadband connections are calculated by adding broadband net additions in the period to prior broadband connections. Broadband net additions are calculated by subtracting the broadband disconnects from the broadband new connections.
TC-TL-000.DNetwork traffic in petabytes
199,318 173,500
Network traffic is calculated according to the estimation methodologies detailed in  Table 1 of the Appendix to the 
Independent Accountants’ Review Report in terabytes divided by 976.5625. Where possible, Verizon uses actual 
network data throughput. In the event that actual data is unavailable, some network data might be extrapolated based on 
historical data, seasonality, expected growth or other business changes. For more information, see the Independent 
Accountants’ Review Report relating to Verizon’s schedule of environmental indicators.Activity metrics

Percentage grid electricity 86.1 84.
7
Percentage renewable energy 3.0 1.5
Total energy consumed is calculated based on emissions sources included in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, namely natural gas, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, propane, kerosene, compressed natural gas, B02, B05, B11, B20, E85, methanol, ethanol, electricity, steam and chilled water.Percentage grid electricity is calculated as total electricity consumed as purchased from the grid (and reported for  Scope 2 GHG emissions) divided by total energy consumed.Percentage renewable electricity is calculated as total renewable electricity generated on site or purchased in the  form of energy attribute certificates divided by total energy consumed.
For more information, see our Emissions profile .
We have set an ambitious goal to source or generate renewable energy equivalent to 50% of our total annual electricity 
consumption by 2025. To achieve this goal, we are entering into long-term power purchase agreements for solar and wind power under development that will bring additional renewable energy to electrical grids across the U.S. The agreements, which are called virtual power purchase agreements or VPPAs, are financially settled and can help reduce Verizon’s long-term exposure to energy price volatility. We generally do not take physical delivery of the energy from the facility under these agreements. Rather the facility operator sells the energy into the wholesale market and we typically receive the renewable energy credits (RECs) associated with the energy sold. We intend to retire these RECs against our actual energy consumption to track our progress in meeting our renewable energy goal. As of December 31, 2020, we have entered into VPPAs for a total of nearly 1.7 GW of anticipated renewable energy capacity. The projects covered by these agreements are expected  to commence commercial operations over the next three years.

SASB code Metric 2020 2019
TC-IM-130a.2 Total water withdrawn (billions of gallons) 2.05 2.35
Water withdrawn (billions of gallons) is based on the total volume of water withdrawn from municipal water utilities for  all 
sites that use municipal water within Verizon’s operational control. Although water use is not a material ESG issue  for 
Verizon, we recognize that water is an extremely important resource and have set a goal to achieve a 15% reduction from 
our 2016 level of 2.6 billion gallons by 2025. Through 2020, we have achieved a 20% reduction from a 2016 baseline.  
T
C-IM-130a.3 Discussion of the integration of environmental considerations into strategic planning for data center needs
Our data center designs and operations leverage the full range of environmental tolerances allowed by most server, storage 
and network hardware suppliers. This enables the wide use of energy-saving practices such as direct outside air (free) cooling, waterside economizer, evaporative cooling, aisle containment and passive exhaust. We also leverage the full limits of our power and cooling infrastructure by monitoring and managing the power demand profile at each layer of distribution. And, in some locations, we use Artificial Intelligence-Machine Learning algorithms to support energy conservation. 
Our data center design embraces modular construction practices that allow for quick deployment and seamless integration 
so new data center capacity arrives just in time. This prevents underutilized capacity from obstructing operations, cost and energy efficiency goals. 99

SASB code Metric 2020 2019
TC-TL-220a.1
TC-IM-220a.1Description of policies and practices relating to behavioral advertising and customer privacy
Verizon and Verizon Media have adopted corporate policies and operating procedures governing how we collect, use, retain 
and protect data. Please see Privacy and data protection .
Detailed information about Verizon’s privacy policies and procedures can be found at the main Privacy Policy  page on our 
corporate website. From this page, you can find links to supplemental policies we have for some of our apps and services 
and to separate privacy policies maintained by Verizon Media  on its and our affiliated companies.  
Our policies and procedures are subject to controls such as internal audits, observations, testing, employee and vendor 
training, and internal attestations that all serve to promote ongoing compliance by the business.
TC-TL-220a.2
TC-IM-220a.2Percentage of customers whose information is 
used for secondary purposes100 100
The reported metric is 100% because, as described in the Verizon and Verizon Media privacy policies, Verizon and Verizon 
Media use customer data to improve our products and services, which is one of the measures SASB uses to define 
secondary purposes for purposes of this metric.
TC-TL-220a.3
TC-IM-220a.3Total amount of significant monetary losses as a 
result of legal proceedings associated with privacy0 0
For purposes of reporting this metric, we have established a significance threshold that is lower than the materiality 
threshold for reporting legal proceedings in our SEC reports and will report any loss of $100 million or more, individually  
or in the aggregate.100

Number of customer selectors whose information 
was requested156,000+ Not available
Percentage resulting in disclosure 88.8 Not available
The metrics reported above are for the six months ended December 31, 2020 and do not include law enforcement requests 
received by Verizon Media, which publishes a separate semiannual transparency report. For more information, please see 
the Verizon Media Transparency Report .
The metrics include subpoenas, warrants and orders that we receive from local, state and federal law enforcement in the 
U.S., but do not include wiretap orders, pen register and trap and trace orders, national security demands and emergency 
requests, which we separately report in our Transparency Report . A customer selector is an information point, such as a 
telephone number, used to identify a customer. Verizon does not maintain a record of unique customers whose information 
was requested because multiple selectors may refer to the same customer (e.g., the same person may have multiple phone 
numbers) and selectors may be duplicated across requests (e.g., the same phone number requested in two subpoenas is 
counted as two selectors). We define a disclosure as a full or partial disclosure of information in response to a request. 
Verizon maintains formal processes and procedures for releasing customer information in response to law enforcement 
requests. For more information, please see our semiannual Transparency Report .
TC-IM-220a.5 List of countries where core products or services are subject to government-required monitoring, blocking, content 
filtering or censoring
On occasion, Verizon is required by government orders, regulations or other legal requirements to block access to specified 
websites. While we have not received blocking demands in the U.S., we have received such demands in a relatively small 
number of other countries. Generally, the blocking demands are issued because the websites are contrary to laws in those 
countries relating to child sexual abuse material, online gambling or copyright. For more information, please see the Verizon 
Transparency Report—International Report .
TC-IM-220a.6 Number of government requests to remove content, percentage compliance with requests
Like other technology and communications companies, Verizon Media receives requests from governments around the 
world to either remove or otherwise modify content from our services based on allegations that it violates local laws, or to 
review content to determine if it should be removed for inconsistency with a product’s Community Guidelines or our Terms 
of Service. For more information, please see the Verizon Media Transparency Report .101
