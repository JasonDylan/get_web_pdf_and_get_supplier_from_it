CONAGRA BRANDS   2019 CITIZENSHIP UPDATE     2
From our President 
and Chief Executive  
Officer
Fiscal year 2019 was an eventful year for  
Conagra Brands. We completed the acquisition  
of Pinnacle Foods, which added such brands  
as Birds Eye,® Wish Bone® and Gardein® to 
our leading portfolio of consumer favorites. As 
we continue to integrate the businesses, we’re 
uncovering numerous opportunities to further our 
progress across the CSR spectrum and manage 
critical environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) challenges and opportunities. Because 
we’re still working on determining the impact that 
the new organization can have, this year’s report 
is simply an update on our progress to date. 
Please see our recent GRI-compliant citizenship 
report, released in May 2019, for additional 
details on environmental, social and governance 
management practices across all our CSR pillars. 
As the size of our business and operations have 
increased, so too has our opportunity to nourish 
even more lives. And that starts with good food, of 
course. But at Conagra, that’s just the beginning.
Nourishing our consumers with good food that 
provides them choices while meeting our high quality 
and food safety standards will always be a focus. This 
past year we launched numerous nutritious offerings 
such as new varieties of Healthy Choice® Power 
Bowls, which are packed with protein and wholesome 
ingredients; Birds Eye Veggie Made, which are 
delicious and nutritious vegetable-based alternatives 
to popular side dishes; and expanded our popular 
Gardein line of plant-based meat alternative products.We also strive to nourish the planet, by sourcing raw 
ingredients and packaging materials responsibly, 
generating less waste for disposal, reducing 
energy use and water use, and helping preserve 
our forests and other resources. This is evidenced 
by our annual Sustainable Development Awards 
program, now in its 10th consecutive year. Over 
the last decade, projects submitted for these 
awards have conserved 3.5 billion gallons of 
water, decreased our carbon footprint by 189,280 
metric tons, and reduced waste by 93,700 tons. 
We also work hard to nourish our employees’ lives, 
both inside the office and in the communities where 
they live. In the office, we provide an inclusive 
environment where they can grow their careers 
and make their mark on the organization. We also 
offer professional development opportunities for 
all employees to support their continuous growth. 
In the communities where our employees live, we 
have an opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the pervasive societal issue of hunger. We 
take a holistic approach which includes employee 
volunteerism—this past year our employees 
volunteered more than 10,500 hours, we donated 
products, which help to stock pantries as well as 
reduce food waste, and contributed financially to 
nonprofits in communities where we operate. 
We’re proud of the impact we’ve been able  
to make, but also know that there’s much more 
to be done. That’s why our employees across 
Conagra Brands are steadfast in our efforts to 
continue to do the right things and do things right. 
Thank you for your continued interest and support.
Sean M. Connolly
President and Chief Executive Officer

TABLE OF CONTENTSOVERVIEW
The people of Conagra Brands make everyday food in extraordinary ways and with unwavering attention to our citizenship ambitions. This means making food that’s 
delicious, safe, nutritious and convenient, while addressing the key economic, environmental and social impacts directly linked to our activities and products, such as 
through business relationships with farmers, suppliers, customers and others. 
Our citizenship strategy includes four focus areas: Good Food, Responsible Sourcing, Better Planet and Stronger Communities. Together, these strategic pillars articulate 
our values and ambitions as a responsible corporate citizen. We look forward to making good food for generations to come, and doing so in a way that supports 
responsible sourcing, stronger communities and a better planet.
Good Food
We continuously strive to make safe, delicious, affordable and nutritious 
foods, while providing the information that consumers need to make 
educated food choices.
Responsible Sourcing
Responsible sourcing of ingredients and packaging materials is about 
more than cost and quality. We also consider the environmental, 
social and economic impacts across our value chain. Better Planet
The health of the planet and availability of natural resources are intricately 
linked to every part of our business. We’re especially focused on taking action 
on climate change, preserving water resources, and eliminating waste.
Stronger Communities
Creating shared value with our community of employees, investors, suppliers  
and business partners—as well as with those who live in places where we 
operate—is critical to our long-term success.Citizenship Philosophy and Focus Areas
Conagra Brands 
Materiality Assessment:
Relative priority 
of corporate 
citizenship topicsIn 2017, we refreshed our materiality analysis to reflect current business strategies and stakeholder dialogues on relevant environmental, social and governance  
(ESG) topics. Our materiality matrix identified 21 topics across four strategic pillars: Better Planet, Good Food, Responsible Sourcing and Stronger Communities. 
Our Citizenship strategy is deeply rooted in this holistic and objective view into what issues matter most, with an eye on how our activities impact global 
efforts to reach the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These 17 goals address challenges such as access to food, inequality, climate change, 
water scarcity, and community empowerment, and intersect with Conagra Brands’ material issues, goals and ESG management strategies. 
While the 2018 acquisition of Pinnacle Foods has changed our overall business footprint, the complementary nature of the Pinnacle Foods portfolio resulted  
in little change to our materiality assessment, especially those topics of critical importance. We plan to do another materiality analysis in the coming years.

TABLE OF CONTENTSFood Safety
Conagra Brands’ Food Safety & Quality teams are 
responsible for managing the integrity of our food—
beginning with sourcing ingredients and all the way 
through preparation and delivery to our customers  
and consumers. These teams are comprised of 
subject matter experts who provide functional 
leadership on all matters related to food safety  
and quality, including:
 Food safety and quality in 
production and distribution
 Supplier food safety and quality
 Consumer affairs
 Sanitation
 Allergens
 Microbiology, toxicology, and chemistry
 Thermal processing
 Religious certification (Kosher, Halal)
 Engineering
 Foreign material contamination
 AuditingOutside of the company, we work closely with our 
suppliers to ensure food safety and quality of our 
ingredients. We require our suppliers to use an 
accredited certification body to audit against Global 
Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) standards annually. 
Approximately 75–80% of our direct suppliers 
have completed GFSI-recognized certification.
We also engage outside experts to help ensure that 
our food safety and quality programs are world-class. 
We have a Food Safety Council, which provides 
ongoing input and advice on new and emerging 
food safety practices. The Council’s members are 
recognized in the industry for their expertise in 
specific food safety disciplines such as food science, microbiology, toxicology, epidemiology, microbial 
physiology, public health and public policy.
As leaders in food safety, we have embraced the  
Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), and look 
forward to working with the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as this important law continues to 
be implemented. In the rare event that our food does 
not meet our high standards for regulatory compliance, 
quality assurance or food safety, we take marketplace 
action as necessary. In fiscal year 2019, we had 
five recalls and one withdrawal, with none resulting 
in injuries or illness at the time. For more detail 
on Conagra’s food safety and quality procedures, 
please refer to our 2018 Citizenship Report.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
GOOD FOOD
Nutrition
Conagra Brands continuously evolves to deliver foods 
with nutritional benefits that are aligned with consumer 
preferences. We deliver these benefits by using whole 
foods and intentional ingredients. Additionally, we have 
laid the groundwork for a focus on environmentally 
sustainable diets. These three elements—nutrition 
benefits, intentional ingredients through whole foods, 
and sustainable diets—build our nutrition platform. 
Nutritional Benefits 
For our health and wellness products, our food 
design framework includes nutrient guardrails that 
enable our food scientists and chefs to create recipes 
that deliver the intended nutrition proposition. The 
nutrient density of our portfolio is considered best in 
class as exemplified by the 2018 Access to Nutrition 
Index (ATNI) U.S. Spotlight Index. After rigorous 
nutrition evaluation by ATNI of the 10 largest U.S. 
food companies’ portfolios, Conagra Brands was 
ranked #1 in the Product Profile ranking. According 
to the report, Conagra Brands was estimated to 
generate 44% of 2016 sales from healthy products 
and 32% from products that meet World Health 
Organization Euro criteria for marketing to children. 
This assessment occurs on a bi-annual basis, 
the next assessment will be released in 2020. Whole-Food Focus
Research shows that consumers are increasingly 
thinking differently about food and their relationship 
with food. They want products that contain whole food 
ingredients that they trust will help them meet their 
goals for health and wellness. Many are now defining 
nutrition both expansively and holistically. It is no 
longer enough that foods claim to provide specific 
“good for you” vitamins, protein, fiber and other  
key nutrients.Conagra Brands has shifted to a nutrition philosophy 
where we focus on foods and ingredients rather 
than specific nutrient reductions or increases. Our 
Healthy Choice® brand exemplifies this philosophy. 
The Power Bowls line features bold flavors and 
an intentional balance of ingredients that align 
with consumer’s current interest in eating healthy, 
nutritious food. Each ingredient is thoughtfully 
selected to provide inspired, on-trend flavors with 
unique nutrient-dense vegetables and whole grains.

TABLE OF CONTENTSGOOD FOOD
Sustainable Diets 
Our approach to nutrition increasingly incorporates 
environmental sustainability. Conagra Brands utilizes 
findings from The EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, 
Planet and Health and recognizes the UN FAO 
definition of sustainable diets, which takes into 
consideration nutrition and health, economic  
impacts, social impacts and cultural context,  
and environmental impacts. 
As part of our ongoing effort to promote adoption of 
sustainable diets in the markets we serve, Conagra 
Brands is increasing the proportion of plant proteins 
relative to animal protein sources in our portfolio. Plant-based brands and platforms are now significant 
parts of our business.
In calendar year 2018, our Gardein brand generated 
$173 million in annual sales, a four-fold increase over 
four years.1 Our Birds Eye frozen vegetable brand 
generates more than $1 billion in annual sales.2 
In June 2019, Conagra Brands was recognized in  
a FAIRR report as a leader in sustainable proteins.  
FAIRR is a group backed by dozens of institutional 
investors managing more than $5 trillion in assets. 
Their report ranked Conagra Brands in the “proactive” category which is top ranking, because we have 
demonstrated evidence of addressing risks in our 
animal protein supply chain and expanded our 
plant-based protein portfolio. 
We are approaching further protein diversification 
in our product portfolio by innovating new plant-
based products and offering approachable 
options for consumers looking to incorporate 
more plant foods into their diets.

TABLE OF CONTENTSGOOD FOODProduct Transparency
Conagra Brands is committed to providing access to the information consumers want and need to make informed decisions about what they eat.
SmartLabel 
SmartLabel leverages mobile technology to 
provide consumers with easy access to product 
information—detailed nutritional information, 
ingredient definitions, allergens, ingredient 
certifications such as USDA organic and Non-
GMO Project Verified, and many other product 
attributes, as well as associated manufacturing 
practices like waste, energy, and water use 
reduction. As of the end of fiscal year 2019, we had 
approximately 2,600 pages live on smartlabel.org.Genetically Modified Ingredients 
Many of our products, such as Hunt’s tomatoes 
and Alexia vegetables, are Non-GMO Project 
Verified. Conagra fully supports the National 
Bioengineered Food Disclosure Law, which requires 
food companies to include information about GMOs 
on product labels and online. Now that the final 
National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard 
has been issued by the USDA, we intend to comply 
fully by the January 2022 compliance deadline.
Allergen Labeling 
The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection 
Act requires food manufacturers to clearly indicate 
when they’ve used one of eight major allergens: 
milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, peanuts, tree 
nuts, wheat, and soy. For any branded foods that 
contain one of these allergens, we include a plain-
language “Contains” statement below the ingredient 
statement. Some of our food packages might feature 
a precautionary “May Contain” statement. Conagra 
closely monitors allergen management trends 
and other food safety risks and works to minimize 
potential impacts. We always use Good Manufacturing 
Practices (GMPs) and thoroughly clean our equipment 
after using allergen-containing ingredients. Gluten-free  
Products
Our portfolio offers options for consumers looking 
for gluten-free foods, including Udi’s® and Glutino® 
bread, snacks, pizza, and baking mixes. According 
to FDA labeling rules, any foods bearing a “Gluten 
Free” claim must contain less than 20 ppm (parts 
per million) gluten. To ensure full compliance with 
the FDA’s defined standard for gluten content, 
Conagra only uses the “Gluten Free” claim on a 
food after implementing comprehensive testing 
protocols, including ingredient reviews, facility 
suitability, and overall product composition.

Responsible Marketing  
to Children 
 
Since 2007, we have participated in the Children’s 
Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) 
of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. We 
adhere to CFBAI’s criteria, including that advertised 
foods contribute important food groups: fruits, 
vegetables, non/low-fat dairy, whole grains, 
essential nutrients, or some combination of these 
components. Our commitments include:
 Devoting 100% of our advertising directed  
to children under 12 years of age to products 
that meet CFBAI’s uniform nutrition criteria.
 Never seeking product placements 
in children’s programming.
 Never running advertising primarily directed  
to children under 6 years of age in TV, radio,  
print or online, including websites, online 
games, DVDs and other video formats, 
mobile apps, and word of mouth platforms.
 Never advertising our foods to children 
in elementary schools, even foods that 
meet CFBAI’s nutrition criteria. This 
commitment applies to the entire school, 
its facilities and grounds, and covers the 
entire school day, whenever children are 
under the supervision of the school or 
third parties on behalf of the school.
CFBAI’s criteria also set rigorous standards that  
limit calories, total sugars, sodium, saturated fat  
and trans fat.
1  To the extent any Conagra Brands products bearing a natural claim are sold or distributed outside the U.S.,  
this statement is not intended to provide any assurances by Conagra Brands as to the compliance of the natural 
claim with any applicable laws or regulations of the country where the products will be sold or distributed.
Natural Product Claims 
Conagra Brands has implemented an internal Natural Council, which is responsible 
for carefully reviewing all proposed natural claims for Conagra Brands’ products. 
Comprised of cross-functional team members from Conagra’s Legal, Regulatory, 
Product Development, Labeling, and Food Safety & Quality departments, the Natural 
Council ensures all Conagra products featuring a natural claim meet the applicable 
U.S. laws and regulations and the company’s requirements for such claims.1 These 
requirements were developed, and are updated as necessary, to be consistent with 
the USDA’s Natural Policy and the FDA’s guidelines for natural claims. All Conagra 
products with a natural claim at a minimum do not contain artificial or synthetic 
ingredients, artificial flavors or colors, or chemical preservatives.BIRDS EYE VEGETABLES

Supplier Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct for Suppliers (last updated in 
October 2019) applies across the board to all of our 
suppliers, and covers legal compliance to workplace 
and human rights; animal welfare; health, safety and 
the environment; ethical dealings; and monitoring and 
recordkeeping. Standards address non-discrimination, 
no forced or compulsory labor, no child labor, 
immigration law compliance, freedom of association, 
animal welfare, deforestation and other areas. 
Each requirement within our Supplier Code of 
Conduct must be absolutely and continuously met 
and supported by appropriate documentation. We 
maintain full rights to inspect facilities and review 
applicable documentation to ensure compliance. 
Our Supplier Code of Conduct also specifies that our 
suppliers must take reasonable actions to ensure that 
their suppliers and sub-contractors are in compliance. 
We provide guidance to our suppliers regarding 
subcontracting and require them to replicate our 
requirements all the way down their supply chains.
Conagra Brands uses a rigorous due diligence 
process to ensure that we have appropriate 
documentation regarding new suppliers and 
the materials to be purchased from them. This 
includes, but is not limited to, spec sheets, allergen 
information, conflicts of interest disclosures, third-
party audits and country of manufacture statements. Our Supplier Quality and Risk teams reviews all 
materials to be purchased, where those materials 
come from, the potential supplier’s third-party 
audit, proposed final use of the material and other 
information about the material or supplier. The 
Supplier Quality team also looks at new suppliers’ 
conformance with specific expectations set 
forth in our Supplier Expectations Manual. Our 
Risk team’s due diligence screens specifically 
include criteria related to environmental 
compliance, child labor and human trafficking. 
Dedicated procurement staff provide continuous 
support to each direct supplier via periodic 
touchpoints to discuss any sustainability 
developments or other issues that might arise. 
In addition, Conagra Brands’ Legal and Human 
Resources teams facilitate internal compliance 
expectations in supplier operations, with confidential 
reporting channels for grievances related to 
concerns such as bribery or corruption. Supplier 
Excellence 
Program
The Supplier Excellence 
Program applies to 
our top direct material 
suppliers, which includes 
60 suppliers, representing 
approximately 75% of 
our overall spend on food 
ingredients, commodities 
and packaging direct 
material spend. 
As part of our Supplier 
Excellence Program, Conagra Brands assesses key 
suppliers at least annually on Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) risk-related performance and 
disclosure. Metrics include public supplier response 
to CDP Water, Forest and Investor questionnaires; 
GRI-compliant reporting; and policy/commitments 
adequately addressing sustainability risks specific 
to the supplier’s industry, including climate 
change. The annual sustainability assessment is 
supplemented by quarterly performance discussions 
and risk analyses, and we work in partnership 
with our suppliers to address any issues or gaps. 
We recognize top performing suppliers at our 
annual Supplier Excellence Summit, with awards 
to recognize suppliers who represent industry best 
practices in Sustainability and Diversity & Inclusion. 
Winners are chosen from among the highest-rated 
suppliers according to our ESG risk assessment.

Based on supplier commitments, by 2022, we expect 85–90% of our current supply base for pork will come from 
supply chains where sows are housed in groups rather than crates for the majority of their lives. By 2025, we 
expect 70% of our current supply base for pork will eliminate gestation crates from their entire supply chain.
We are continuing dialogues with our suppliers about gestation crate elimination, the majority of whom have

Packaging Sustainability
Packaging serves a critical role in maintaining both food 
freshness and safety, but waste from plastic packaging is a 
growing issue. Conagra is committed to producing packaging 
that takes environmental impacts into account while continuing to 
ensure food quality and safety, and we are striving toward making 
100% of our current plastic packaging renewable, recyclable 
or compostable by 2025. 
We aim to reduce waste derived from packaging through 
thoughtful design and by using renewable and more readily 
recyclable or compostable materials. Our fiber-based Healthy 
Choice Power Bowls have helped avoid the use of more than  
2.1 million pounds of plastic packaging since being introduced  
in 2017. Over the next few years, we aim to avoid the use of an 
additional 33 million pounds of plastic through further 
development of plant-based packaging options and other 
packaging innovations.
For more on our management approach to sustainable 
packaging, please view our most recent GRI citizenship report.
Healthy food can only come from a resilient ecosystem where 
everyone is playing their part. For our Healthy Choice brand,  
we continue to source our ingredients from U.S. farmers and vet 
international suppliers (like farmers in developing economies 
who receive sustainable agriculture training). And recently, we 
made the switch to plant-based fiber packaging for our Power 
Bowls, which allowed us to cut more than a million pounds of 
plastic used for trays. Our manufacturing processes have helped 
us lower greenhouse gas emissions and reduce our annual 
energy use by almost 2 million kilowatt hours, but we know our 
work doesn’t stop here. We’re committed to extending the 
concept of “healthy” to our entire supply chain.

Operational Sustainability
Conagra Brands is committed to making the planet 
better. We focus our resources in key areas where it 
matters most across our value chain. Climate change, 
water resources and waste are the most material 
issues and, therefore, key areas of focus for us. 
Climate change affects agricultural industries 
throughout the world and is a fundamental challenge 
to food production. It is dramatically affecting how we 
source raw ingredients to make our food, and how we manage energy use in our facilities and across  
our value chain. Water resources are also essential 
throughout our value chain. From growing our raw 
ingredients to preparing and enjoying our food, all  
of us depend upon clean water every day. And, 
preventing waste—particularly food waste—is an 
important measure of our operating efficiency and  
an important social and environmental issue.In October 2018, Conagra Brands committed to adopt 
science-based targets in line with the Science Based 
Targets Initiative and we are now in the process of 
setting our targets. These must be set within 24 
months of our initial commitment and we are working 
diligently to have these in place and included in next 
year’s Citizenship Report. Our goals guide us to 
source raw ingredients and packaging materials 
responsibly, to generate less waste for disposal, to 
reduce energy use and water use, and to help 
preserve our forests and other resources.

Environmental Management
Our global Environment, Occupational Health and 
Safety Philosophy, signed by CEO Sean Connolly, 
drives us towards continuous environment health and 
safety (EH&S) improvement, as measured by our 
leading environmental and safety indicators and 
implemented through our EH&S management 
approach. We are committed to complying with 
environmental laws and regulations and to protecting 
natural resources and we educate employees on five 
Conagra environmental and sustainability policy areas: 
Environmental, Compliance, Climate Change, Water 
Stewardship and Resource Conservation.
Through a robust Environmental Management System, 
we proactively manage environmental issues and 
share best practices among our facilities around the 
world. We routinely assess compliance through 
internal environmental audits. When compliance 
issues arise, our team of environmental professionals 
works closely with the affected facility to educate  
and develop effective action plans and track findings  
to resolution.
In fiscal year 2019, Conagra Brands received 21 
Notices of Violation (NOVs) across legacy Conagra 
Brands and Pinnacle Foods facilities, and paid 
financial penalties associated with two, for a total of 
$151,500 in environmental fines. Nearly all of this 
environmental fine amount was associated with a 
legacy Pinnacle Foods facility violation that took place 
prior to Conagra Brands’ acquisition. Per our standard 
procedure, each NOV was assessed to determine any 
opportunities to prevent or mitigate the situations  
going forward.

Climate change affects agricultural industries 
throughout the world and is a fundamental challenge 
to food production. It is dramatically affecting how  
we source raw ingredients to make our food, and how 
we manage energy use in our facilities and across our

Scope 1 & 2 Emissions
In fiscal year 2019, our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas 
emissions (CO₂e) were approximately 848,770.73 
metric tons. This is a less than 1% increase from our 
fiscal year 2008 emissions but also reflects the 
significant increase of facilities in our network following 
the Pinnacle acquisition in October 2018. 
Scope 3 Emissions
During fiscal year 2019, we estimate the Scope 3 GHG 
emissions associated with sending waste materials to 
landfills were 12,910.25 metric tons. Diverting 85% of

energy intensity—the energy use per pound of product 
produced—stayed the same for natural gas, and 
increased 10% for electricity due to increased 
production and recently acquired facilities.  
In fiscal year 2019, 5.1% of our electricity came  
from renewable energy sources, the equivalent of 
165,344.38 gigajoules.

Corporate Ethics
Code of Conduct 
The Conagra Brands Code of Conduct provides 
guideposts for how all of our employees and directors 
must conduct themselves when representing Conagra 
Brands both inside and outside the workplace. All new 
employees are required to take a course on our Code 
of Conduct as part of their onboarding process. We 
conduct annual  trainings to ensure that employees 
are aware of our expectations and their obligations 
under the Code of Conduct. We also expect 
contractors, consultants, trainees, temps/agency 
workers, interns and volunteers to follow our Code 
of Conduct. Other service providers and suppliers 
must act ethically and in a manner consistent with our 
Code of Conduct and other contract requirements. 
Our board of directors approved the code, and 
overall administration is handled by our Legal and 
Government Affairs department. The day-to-day 
administration of our Code of Conduct is managed 
by our local management teams. Matters relating 
to our Code of Conduct are routinely reported to 
the Audit/Finance Committee, which oversees the 
code at the highest level and designates appropriate 
personnel to determine remedial actions in the 
event of a violation. In addition, we require that 
our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, 
and controller comply with a separate Code 
of Ethics for Senior Corporate Officers.Ethical Employment Practices 
Conagra Brands prohibits the use of any forced  
or compulsory labor, including human trafficking 
and slavery, in all of our operations. Any work 
performed by an employee or other individual that 
is involuntary and/or performed under the threat of 
physical harm or other penalty is strictly prohibited. 
Conagra Brands also complies with state and federal 
child labor laws through our hiring policies and 
human resources practices. Our standard entry-level 
wage is equal to—and often exceeds—the local 
minimum wage in locales in which we operate. 
 To the extent any employee objects to his or her terms 
and/or conditions of employment or sees anything 
else of concern, he or she may raise a complaint 
to his or her manager, a member of the Legal and 
Government Affairs department, and/or through 
our third-party ethics hotline 866.567.CODE (2633). 
Conagra Brands takes seriously all reports made 
through our ethics hotline and ensures that all are 
investigated properly. We have a strict non-retaliation 
policy for all good faith reports made through all 
reporting channels, including our ethics hotline.

As follow-up to any workplace injury or illness  
(an “incident”) or near miss, we require a thorough 
investigation to identify and address the root cause.  
During fiscal year 2019, our Occupational Safety  
& Health Administration (OSHA) Incident Rate (OIR) 
experienced a 4% increase from the previous year, an expected outcome of reporting and tracking 
standardization across newly acquired facilities.  
The OIR was 2.28 incidents per 100 full-time workers, 
which is below the industry average of 4.21 for 
companies in the food manufacturing sector.  
In fiscal year 2019, OSHA inspected 7 Conagra Brands

skills, healthy and active lifestyles, and select urban 
agricultural programs that have a clear community 
focus and provide entrepreneurial skills to help 
individuals participate in the farm-to-fork economy.
This report highlights some of our key initiatives 
and the nonprofit partners we have supported to 
ensure that the communities where we do business 
have access to healthy and nutritious food.

STRONGER COMMUNITIES
Feeding America
Conagra Brands has a long-standing relationship 
with Feeding America, the nation’s leading hunger 
relief nonprofit. The Conagra Brands Foundation has 
funded research to understand how hunger impacts 
vulnerable populations; national PSAs and marketing 
campaigns to raise awareness; programs to improve 
access to nutritious food; and local grants to increase 
the capacity of Feeding America’s network of 200 
food banks across the nation. We are a proud partner 
with Feeding America on its nationwide Hunger Action 
Month campaign each September, which is designed 
to mobilize the public to take action on the issue 
of hunger. Conagra Brands also provides all of our 
donations of food to Feeding America. In fiscal year 
2019, we donated over 19.4 million pounds of food 
to Feeding America and its network of food banks. Month of Service
Conagra’s Month of Service every April is an 
opportunity for employees across North America 
to give back and make a difference in their own 
backyards. In fiscal year 2019, the program 
grew in scope as we welcomed legacy Pinnacle 
employees and incorporated their traditional spring 
service program ACTs (Action Changes Things). 
While we encourage employees to volunteer on 
causes near and dear to their hearts throughout 
the year, during Month of Service we focus on 
issues including hunger, nutrition, food insecurity, 
and access to healthy food. From repacking 
fresh fruits and vegetables and much-needed 
protein at food banks; to preparing and serving 
meals for those in need; to helping plant and 
maintain urban gardens; and more, our activities 
generated the equivalent of 697,277 meals for 
people facing food insecurity across the United 
States and in Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico.Nourish Our Community
For the past 25 years we have invited employees 
to nominate nonprofit organizations that are near 
and dear to their hearts to be considered for grants 
through the Nourish Our Community program. In fiscal 
year 2019, we awarded grants totaling $294,100 to 
16 highly-regarded and well-established nonprofits in 
12 states, including Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, 
Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. 
By funding effective local programs, the Nourish 
Our Community program directly impacts our 
friends and neighbors in communities across the 
country. Conagra employees play a pivotal role 
in the success of this program—in addition to 
nominating the nonprofit organizations, an all-
employee panel reviews each application and 
ultimately makes the final grant decisions.

TABLE OF CONTENTSSTRONGER COMMUNITIESShine the Light on Hunger
The Shine the Light on Hunger campaign, now in 
its 12th year, is a community-wide call to action, 
advocacy, and education campaign that raises 
awareness and funds to support food access 
programs in Nebraska and Western Iowa. In 2018, 
our goal was to raise the equivalent of over 1.5 million 
meals for Food Bank for the Heartland, a leader in the 
fight against hunger and food insecurity in the region. 
We recognize that achieving a goal of this magnitude 
requires the support of the larger community and 
worked with a coalition of local partners including 
the Mayor’s office, Baker’s Supermarkets, and 
arts and cultural institutions to engage everyone 
in the campaign. The Conagra Brands Foundation 
continued its annual commitment to match these 
donations dollar-for-dollar up to $100,000. Together, 
we managed to raise the equivalent of 2.1 million 
meals, making it our most successful campaign yet.
United Way
The United Way seeks to advance the common 
good in areas across the country—and around 
the world—by focusing on education, income, 
and health: the building blocks for good quality 
of life and strong communities. There are active 
United Way chapters in all 50 states, in or near the 
communities where our employees live and work. 
During the fall 2019 campaign, we encouraged 
employees at locations around the country to 
make personally-meaningful gifts that would 
benefit their local United Way. Employees also 
had the opportunity to contribute through in-office 
fundraisers including bake sales, carnivals, and 
professional headshot sessions. With participation 
from employees at 30 facilities and office 
locations, we contributed more than $550,000 
to United Way offices around the country.Disaster Relief
When disaster strikes, especially within the 
communities where our employees live and work, 
Conagra Brands works with local nonprofits to 
provide funds and product donations. In fiscal year 
2019, with flooding in Texas, Nebraska and Iowa, 
Conagra made contributions to the American Red 
Cross and other local organizations to support 
employees and other impacted residents. Additionally, 
the company made contributions to the American 
Red Cross and local non-profits to support residents 
impacted by Hurricanes Florence and Michael.

Thank you for your interest in Conagra Brands’ 2019 Citizenship Report. 
All data in this report cover the company’s fiscal year 
2019, which ended May 27, 2019, unless otherwise 
specified. Our reporting covers all company-owned 
facilities, other than one international location in Italy, 
which was divested in May 2019. APEX Companies, 
LLC completed an independent verification of 
environmental data included in the Better Planet 
section of this report. Other data included in the report 
have not been audited by a third party; however, the 
report does include the best information available 
through our existing data management systems. 
Additional information about our company is available 
on our website, www.conagrabrands.com. 
In October 2018, Conagra Brands completed the 
acquisition of Pinnacle Foods Inc. Unless otherwise 
noted, data contained in this report generally include 
the brands and facilities acquired in that transaction 
since the date we acquired them. This acquisition 
significantly changed our business footprint and 
we are currently working to adjust our long-term 
sustainability goals to be more reflective of our 
current business footprint. These adjusted goals 
will be stated in future reports and on our website. 
In November 2016, we completed the spin-
off of our Lamb Weston potato business. This 
included several potato production facilities. 
Appropriate baseline adjustments were made 
to all reported environmental metrics.
