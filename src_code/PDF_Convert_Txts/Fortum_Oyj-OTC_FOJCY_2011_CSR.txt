Traditional energy production uses conventional 
power plant technologies based on fi  nite primary energy sources, such as fossil fuels. The production has many environmental impacts and low energy effi  ciency. Today’s energy system is not just traditional, but also advanced, resource-effi  cient 
technologies exist together with the traditional ones.   in advanced energy production, resource 
effi  ciency will be one of the main drivers for development. combined heat and power (chp) will play an important role as it increases primary energy effi  ciency considerably. with renewable or low-
carbon fuels chp is a key step towards 
Solar Economy. The effi  ciency of Co
2-free 
nuclear power can be increased signifi  cantly, if heat and electricity can be produced at the same time. in advanced nuclear energy production, the use of uranium’s energy content can be improved considerably. At fortum, we believe that there is a need to make a transition from 
traditional energy production towards Solar Economy with infi  nite and zero-emission energy production and high resource and system effi  ciency – a development towards producing and consuming energy in a smarter 
way. this report discusses the different angles of Solar economy and presents 
fortum’s view as well as activities regarding the future energy system. A more detailed description of Solar economy is presented on pages 40–43.

Interview with the President and CEO
how has Fortum responded to 
the uncertainty factors of the operating environment in 2011?
Fortum has been through a turbulent 
year, and the instability in the European 
economy, among other things, has added 
to the operational challenges. The eco -
nomic uncertainty in the eurozone has 
weakened the outlook particularly in the 
financial markets for the immediate years ahead. For this reason, we have paid close 
attention to our cash flow and have kept 
our balance sheet strong and our liquid -
ity good. We have also drafted a flexible 
action plan in case the outlook darkens. Lately, the energy sector has been a focus of interest 
both politically and for the public at large. In 2011, the fukushima nuclear accident, the Arab Spring and economic uncertainty, among other things, have 
challenged players in the sector. f ortum’s president 
and Ceo t apio Kuula discusses how the company has 
fared in the volatile operating environment. How did Fortum’s strategy guide 
the company’s activities in 2011?  
Leveraging the Nordic business, creat -
ing economic added value in Russia and 
building a platform for future growth 
are at the core of Fortum’s strategy. Our strategy guides our activities very specifi -
cally, and the execution of the strategy is supported by our strong competence in carbon dioxide-free hydro and nuclear 
power production, combined heat and 
power (CHP) production and in operating in the energy markets. Sustainability is a 
strategic cornerstone for us and also an 
integral part of our daily operations.  
In 2011, we made progress in many 
important areas. We have implemented

production structure of the heat business 
in order to sharpen our focus on energy-
and resource-efficient CHP production. At the same time, we are creating a new growth platform in France by preparing 
for the participation of the French hydro 
concession bidding. We’ve started mapping growth opportunities also in India, where we opened an office in February 2012. 
In Finland, Fortum has an approxi -
mately 26% interest in TVO’s Olkiluoto 3 
nuclear power project under construction 
and in the new Olkiluoto 4 project, the bidding and engineering phase of which 
was launched in autumn. In Sweden, we 
have raised the output and improved the availability of nuclear power plants. 
how did Fortum achieve its 
sustainability targets in 2011? 
We achieved out climate targets, although the specific CO
2 emissions from our total 
energy production increased by nearly 10% from the previous year. The increase was due to the commissioning of new 
plants, which raised the relative share of 
our Russian mainly natural gas-based production in our total energy production. 
fortum S uStAINABILI tY report 2011 fortum IN 2011 17   Our specific CO 2 emissions from electric -
ity generation in the EU were slightly less 
than in 2010. In a European comparison, 
Fortum’s specific CO 2 emissions, including 
Russian operations, were among the lowest 
in the sector and about half of the average 
in the sector.
I am particularly pleased with the 
improved occupational safety. In 2011, we 
achieved our best record ever in injury 
frequency for our employees. Contractor safety also improved. Unfortunately, in 
December, the good progress was overshad -
owed by a fatal accident involving one of our contractors in Sweden. I would like to extend sincere condolences to the victim’s 
family and co-workers. The internal acci -
dent investigation has been completed and 
we will continue working with even more 
diligence to improve safety.
Sustainability is and will continue to be 
a cornerstone of our operations, and we can 
be proud of the fact that our performance 
in the area of sustainability has received 
a lot of recognition – also internationally. 
Among other things, our company was 
ranked the best utility in the world in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index mea -
suring the management of climate issues.  
Sustainability is and will 
continue to be a cornerstone  
of our operations, and we can be proud of the fact that our performance in  the area of 
sustainability  has received 
a lot of recognition – also 
internationally. 18 fortum IN 2011 fortum S uStAINABILI tY report 2011how did Fortum achieve its 
financial targets in 2011?
In summer, Fortum’s share price reacted 
strongly to the new Finnish Government’s 
programme, which proposes investigating 
the implementation of a possible windfall and uranium tax. Moreover, the pro -
gramme noted that the Government will not make any new decisions-in-principle on nuclear power. 
However, the Government programme’s 
policies have not had a direct impact on 
Fortum’s earnings. Fortum’s full-year earn -
ings per share as well as operating profit 
developed favourably. This is partially due to 
the non-recurring revenue from the divest -
ment of operations outside the scope of our 
strategy. Fortum’s operating profit was also positively affected by IFRS accounting treat -
ment of derivates mainly used for hedging Fortum’s power production. Our profitabil -
ity is still at a good level and the structure 
of our balance sheet and our liquidity are 
strong. Because of these factors, Fortum is well positioned for the future. 
hydropower and chp  
production are key elements 
in Fortum’s strategy. Why does Fortum see potential specifically in these activities? 
Fortum has a long track-record and exten -
sive experience in the design, construc -
tion and responsible use of hydropower. 
In fact, the company is one of the most significant hydropower producers in the Nordic countries. In 2011, we produced 
72.7 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electric -
ity; of which hydropower accounted for 
21.0 TWh. Moreover, in many respects, 
hydropower is a very competitive produc -
tion form because of its flexibility and 
eco-friendliness. CHP, in turn, is a very 
energy- and resource-efficient alterna -
tive for energy production, especially at 
Nordic latitudes, because its production 
capacity is the best during winter when 
the demand is higher. 
when will the investment 
programme in r ussia 
start to produce a positive 
economic value added? 
Fortum continued its extensive invest -
ment programme in Russia in 2011 with 
the commissioning of three new units. 
The total output of the three units taken into commercial use is over 600 mega -
watts (MW) of our 2,400-MW investment 
programme in Russia. This new capacity, 
built under the Government’s capacity supply agreement, will receive guaran -
teed payments for a period of 10 years. The impact of the new units we have built is already visible in the 2011 comparable 
operating profit, which in the Russia 
Division increased from EUR 8 million to EUR 74 million. We will continue imple -
menting the programme in 2012 with the commissioning of two of the three 418-MW units at the new Nyagan power plant. how has r ussian electricity 
market reform progressed? 
Russia had liberalised most of the whole -
sale markets for electricity by the begin -
ning of 2011, but the work is ongoing in areas like development of financial prod -
ucts and capacity markets. For Fortum, 
realisation of the market reform was one 
of the key reasons for investing in Russia, and, indeed, we now see that the reform 
has progressed as planned. 
Russia is also investing in energy 
efficiency improvements through several programmes and international collabora -
tion. Russia’s heat markets are of interest 
to Fortum because of the huge potential for energy-efficiency improvements in the 
country’s heat sector. how has Fortum performed with 
its sustainability targets in r ussia?
Sustainability is at the core of our opera -
tions also in Russia, but the most urgent targets of improvement there differ some -
what from those in the Nordic countries, 
for instance. In Russia, we have put signifi -
cant effort into improving occupational safety and reducing conventional envi -
ronmental impacts, like nitrogen oxide, 
sulphur dioxide and particle emissions, 
limiting emissions into waterways and improving energy efficiency. By raising 
energy efficiency, we also reduce specific 
CO
2 emissions. In these areas, we have 
already achieved clear results. We have also 
switched to using a better quality of coal at 
the Argayash plant and improved efficiency in processing the wastewater from the ash

Chelyabinsk and Tobolsk regions. OAO For -
tum’s operations recently passed the first phase of certification audit in accordance 
with the international ISO14001 standard.
how have the Fukushima nuclear 
accident in Japan and the ensuing 
political decisions in Europe affected Fortum’s safety culture and business operations?
The accident at the Fukushima nuclear 
power plant last year sparked a lot of dis -
cussions; the attitudes towards the accident and the decisions made because of it have varied in different countries. As a nuclear power company, safety is always our most 
important and the primary factor behind 
all activities in nuclear power production. Over the years, the prepardness for severe 
reactor accident management has been 
improved significantly at our Loviisa power plant and at our co-owned plants. Nuclear 
safety is also the specific focus in a signifi -
cant part of Fortum’s research and develop -
ment work. Based on this work, the Loviisa power plant’s safety and preparedness for 
severe accidents has been and will continue to be improved over the long-term.  
In the light of the safety evaluations by 
the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and the EU-wide nuclear power 
stress tests, there are no critical safety-
related changes in sight for Fortum-owned nuclear power plants. No significant new 
requirements, new threats or shortcom -
ings requiring immediate corrective action were found in Finnish nuclear power 
plants. The results of assessments made in 
Sweden were similar to those in Finland. 
Based on the further assessment, the devel -
opment targets to be selected later can be 
implemented within the framework of the 
Loviisa power plant’s annual investment programmes, and they will not have a sig -
nificant impact on the plant’s availability. 
Climate change is a global challenge 
in need of solutions. For this reason, I 
believe that the world will continue to need 
nuclear power. Fortum’s nuclear power know-how is at a very high level interna -
tionally, and that’s why we view, e.g., the development of existing nuclear power plants as an interesting business area. 
how will Fortum develop its 
electricity grids and operations 
in preparation for storms and other natural phenomena?
The storm that raged in Fortum’s grid 
area in Finland and Sweden at the end of 
the year knocked out power for more than 
200,000 households and caused consider -
able financial damage for the company. I 
want to express my regrets to our custom -
ers for the difficulties and the widespread 
power outages caused by this storm. 
Although Fortum had prepared for the 
storm by quadrupling the number of ser -
vice technicians, the situation was excep -
tional compared to the forecasts. Since the storm, we have carefully analysed our operations and have mapped the areas 
requiring improvement. In a power outage situation, we must be able to serve a large 
number of customers more quickly, and that requires the implementation of, e.g., 
a text messaging service and improve -
ments to our IT systems. Even though 
repairing the storm damage was success -
ful in light of the difficult situation, we will continue developing also that aspect of our operations.  
Society’s growing dependence on elec -
tricity is another reason for the increasing 
importance of storm preparation. Climate   change is also expected to increase 
extreme weather phenomena. Fortum is 
setting a long-term target to cut the num -
ber of power outages in half and to double 
the number of customers currently within 
the scope of weather-proof distribution by 2020. It is possible to accelerate under -
ground cabling, particularly in places most critical for operational reliability, in addition to which areal lines can be 
moved from the forest to the roadside. 
The weather reliability of the distribution 
20 fortum IN 2011 fortum S uStAINABILI tY report 2011network also can be improved by better 
management of adjacent forests and with grid automation.  
where will Fortum pursue 
growth in the future?
As I mentioned, we are committed to the extensive investment programme in 
Russia, which will increase our capacity 
significantly. Additionally, our investment programme in Europe will grow our elec -
tricity production capacity by a total of 800 MW and our heat production capacity by about 230 MW by 2015. We are explor -
ing business opportunities also in India, which is one of the fastest growing mar -
kets in the world. Our growth platform 
there is based on our special expertise in 
energy-efficient CHP production, in which we can also use local biofuels. The focus of global economic 
growth is shifting to a sia. 
what is the outlook for the 
European energy market? 
There is still plenty of development 
potential in the European energy market, 
e.g., in market integration. I consider the 
market-driven development of the energy markets and stronger harmonisation of the rules of the operating environment to 
be very important. Efficiently functioning, 
broader markets benefit customers, soci -
ety and the environment. They also enable 
the right investments in the right place, 
whether in bio, solar, wave or wind power.  Fortum’s vision is that the future 
energy system is based on s olar 
Economy. h ow has Fortum 
prepared for such a sizable change in the energy system?
Fortum is already using production forms 
that are part of Solar Economy, such as 
hydropower and bioenergy. However, I 
believe that energy will have to be pro -
duced and consumed increasingly more 
sensibly in the future. In fact, the future 
energy system should be based on carbon dioxide-free electricity production and on 
energy security and efficiency. In our view 
the energy system will gradually shift 
from conventional electricity production 
technologies, exhaustible energy sources and fossil fuels towards  so-called Solar 
Economy. However, with the exception 
of hydropower, wind power and bioen -
ergy, Solar Economy production forms 
are still very much in the development 
phase. Therefore, also Fortum is actively researching future energy production 
technologies, like biofuels for CHP pro-
duction, and wave power. We envision good opportunities also in the direct utili -
sation of solar power, and we believe that we can develop concrete business in this area in the near future. The future energy system 
should be based on carbon 
dioxide-free electricity 
production and on energy security and efficiency.What are Fortum’s development 
steps moving forward?  
Fortum’s strong balance sheet and pro -
ductive capital structure enable us to be 
well prepared also for a more uncertain 
outlook. In the future, the relative share of electricity in total energy consumption 
will grow, offering Fortum more business 
opportunities. I believe that we have good potential to grow in line with our mis -
sion and strategy. 
The strong competence of our person -
nel has naturally been instrumental in 
implementing our strategy, and I want 
to take this opportunity to thank all Fortum employees for a job well done. 
And I want to extend a special thank-you 
to our customers. It is truly unfortunate that the winter storms resulted in some 
customers having to wait days – and in 
some cases even weeks – to have their power restored. We will do everything we 
can to serve our customers better also in 
exceptional circumstances like these.
Additionally, I would like to thank 
our shareholders for the past year. We will continue our work to grow share -
holder value and to resolutely develop our 
operations in spite of uncertainty in the 
global economy. fortum S uStAINABILI tY report 2011 fortum IN 2011 21   22 towArDS SoLAr eCoNomY 1 fortum SuStAINABILItY report 2011Fortum is contributing to fulfi  lling the con-

sustainability integrated 
in Fortum’s strategy
Fortum’s mission captures our dedication to sustainability. For us, sustainability means balanced management of the 
economic, social and environmental 
responsibility in the company’s opera -
tions. Fortum’s values – accountability, 
creativity, respect and honesty – form the 
foundation for all our activities. Fortum’s strategy is consistent with 
our vision of the future energy system, 
Solar Economy (read more on page s 
40–43). Our strategy aims for continuous 
development of existing operations and 
growth in CO 2-free hydro and nuclear 
power and in energy efficient combined heat and power (CHP) production. With 
our research and development we aim to contribute to the development of cli -
mate benign and efficient energy system 
in the society. 
Fortum’s core competences 
Hydro and nuclear power are CO 2-free 
production forms, and competitive in 
terms of variable costs. Therefore, they 
both have a significant role in Fortum’s 
production portfolio. In 2011, 83% of 
Fortum’s power generation in Europe 
was based on hydro and nuclear power. 
As CO 2 has an economic value in Europe, 
the high proportion of CO 2-free pro -
duction is a competitive advantage to 
Fortum. Hydropower also enables fast 
responses to market conditions and 
thus supports Fortum’s competitiveness 
in electricity markets, where increased 
price volatility is foreseen in the future. Hydropower’s role in balancing pro -
duction and consumption will be more important when an increasingly larger 
share of electricity is produced with, e.g., wind and solar energy. In terms of Solar 
Economy, hydropower is already today an 
important production form and the only proven CO
2-free renewable energy source 
with a long history of use.
Combined heat and power (CHP) 
contributes to the growing demand for 
resource efficiency and to the increased 
utilisation of local biofuels. Fortum con -
siders itself as a globally leading expert 
in energy- and resource-efficient CHP 
production technology. In terms of total production volume, Fortum is the world’s 
fourth-largest heat producer. Fortum’s high competence in fuel flexibility makes it pos -
sible to use a wide selection of fuels, includ -
ing bio-based and local fuels such as waste.
Energy market expertise and the abil -
ity to anticipate market development have enabled Fortum’s success in the 2000s. 
They are also central when pursuing opportunities in the integrating European 
and fast-growing Asian energy markets.

building a platform for future growth
Fast population growth in developing 
nations is shifting the growth in elec-

same time, climate change and local environmental problems create a need for 
sustainable, CO

solutions. Also the liberalisation of power markets is advancing and the need for pri-
vate capital is growing in the Asia’s rapidly growing and developing economies. For

strategy realisation in 2011
2011 was unexceptionally turbulent 
for the energy sector. The Fukushima 
nuclear accident in Japan, the ongo -
ing financial crisis in Europe and the 
unstable situation in the Middle East and 
North Africa, all have had implications 
to the energy sector, which is becom -
ing more and more exposed to global 
phenomena. The slow progress towards 
a global climate deal has emphasised the need for clear long-term signals and pre -
dictability for energy investments. 
Despite the circumstances, Fortum 
succeeded in the implementation of its 
strategy and in achieving operational 
enhancements. The company continued with investments in order to support its 
long-term goals. Key achievements in the 
strategic core areas have been presented on the right. Read more on our invest -
ments on pages 61–66.
sustainability approach
Fortum’s sustainability approach cap -
tures the balanced management of the 
economic, social and environmental 
responsibility in the company’s opera -
tions. At Fortum, business and sustain -
ability performance are tightly linked, underlining the role of sustainable solu -
tions as a competitive advantage. fortum S uStAINABILIt Y report 2011  SuStAINABILIt Y INte GrAteD IN S trAteGY 27   Fortum’s extensive investment programme 
in russia is progressing. The new invest-ments support the implementation of Fortum’s strategy as they increase the CHP production of the company. In 2011, the new unit in Tyumen and the new power capac-ity in Tobolsk add ed production capacity 
together with 403 megawatts (Mw) power 
and 256 Mw heat. also the new CHP unit 
at Chelyabinsk CHP-3 increas ed the plant’s 
electricity generation capacity with 216 Mw 
and heat production capacity with 56 Mw. 
The new investments provide clear 
environmental benefi  ts. The new units represent the best available technology improving the effi  ciency of the plants and decreasing CO
2 emissions. For example, 
the energy effi  ciency of the new unit in Tyumen is over 85% and the CO 2 emissions 
in the area will reduce by 400 000 tonnes annually. In Chelyabinsk the new unit’s fuel consumption is 20% lower than that of existing gas-fi  red units, and its effi  ciency increases to 77%. The investments also support the well-being of the local societies by employing workforce. 
In total, Fortum’s russia division 
invested Eur 670 million in 2011. The investment programme continues in Nyagan, w here two out of three new units 
will be commissioned in 2012. The value 
of the remaining part of the investment programme was estimated to be approxi-
mately Eur 0.9 billion as of January 2012.Case:

The economic responsibility for 
Fortum means competitiveness, perfor-
mance excellence and market-driven 
production, which create long-term value and enable profi  table growth. Fortum 
aims for performance excellence through 
continuous development of operational effi  ciency and core processes. We recog-
nise that competitive advantage can be 
gained through benchmark operations in fuel management and trading, success 
in investments and customer processes, 
optimal operation and maintenance of power plants as well as core management 
of support processes. 
The environmental responsibility 
at Fortum emphasises effi  cient use of resources and need to mitigate climate 
change and highlights our know-how in CO
2-free hydro and nuclear power 
production and in energy-effi  cient CHP 
production. Research and develop-
ment activities create prerequisites for environmentally-benign energy solu-
tions. Climate change mitigation and the 
reduction of carbon dioxide emissions are important goals that affect the energy sector and the development of electricity 
and heat production. In addition to new 
technical innovations, also low-emissions and effi  cient traditional production tech-
nologies will be needed for a long time. 
In the area of social responsibility, 
Fortum’s innovations and the secure supply of low-carbon power and heat 
support the development of society and increase well-being. Fortum’s sustain-
ability approach also includes being 
a good corporate citizen and taking care of its own personnel and the sur-
rounding community. Fortum promotes 
well-being and safety in the work envi-ronment, respect for individuals and 
mutual trust, and responsible opera-
tions in society.At Fortum, business and 
sustainability performance are 
tightly linked, underlining the 
role of sustainable solutions as a competitive advantage.

Revision of Fortum’s 
code of c onduct
In 2011, Fortum revised its Code of Con -
duct. Fortum’s previous Code of Conduct 
originated from 2007 and was introduced 
to the employees in 2008. The Code of Conduct has since been part of the 
introduction of new employees. Fortum’s 
strategic intent to enter emerging mar -
kets as well as other changes in corporate 
structure and the operating environ -
ment, including the launch of the UK 
Anti-Bribery Act, called for revision work. 
The Board of Directors approved the 
revised Code of Conduct in January  2012. The implementation of the revised Code of Conduct with an advanced e-learning tool will be one of the key sustainability 
activity affecting all employees at For -
tum during 2012.

slowed during the year, which was reflected in stagnant  electricity demand. 
However, the European utility sector was on par with other European industry 
sectors’ performance, as the equity mar -
kets were mostly affected by general eco -
nomic uncertainty with relatively stable commodity prices.
While the Russian economy grew 
faster than the world average, growth 
there also slowed somewhat towards the 
end of the year. Fortum operates in the 
Chelyabinsk and Tyumen areas in Rus -
sia. In the Chelyabinsk area, where much 
of the metals industry is located, power 
demand increased by nearly 4% from the previous year, while power demand 
growth in the oil- and gas-rich Tyumen 
area was modest. Electricity demand in 
North-Western Russia overall increased 
by 2% in 2011. Volatile operating environment
During the first half of 2011, commodity 
prices roller-coasted after the Fukushima 
nuclear accident; but, due to escalat -
ing sovereign debt worries and slowing 
growth, they started to even out in the 
summer and the latter part of the year. 
European CO 2 prices in particular were 
affected and fell in early summer, due 
to increased uncertainty in terms of 
economic development and hence the demand for CO
2 allowances. Speculations 
on the future European carbon reduction 
policies also contributed to the drop in 
European CO 2 prices.
Due to declining commodity prices in 
the latter part of the year and increasing precipitation, Nordic electricity prices were at EUR 47 per megawatt-hour (MWh) 
on average in 2011, which was nearly a tenth lower than the previous year. Ger -
man EEX prices were EUR 51/MWh on average in 2011. They were a tenth lower 
than in the previous year. Russian spot power prices (excluding capacity fees) 
were at RUB 989/MWh (EUR 23/MWh) 
on average – about 12% higher than the previous year. 
Average differences between area 
prices in Finland and Sweden compared to 
the Nord Pool system prices were smaller 
in 2011 than in 2010. In the autumn, how -
ever, the Finnish area prices were higher 
than the Swedish area prices and also 
above the system price level due to high rainfall in southern Norway and Sweden 
and limited available transmission capac -
ity. Correlation of the wholesale price in 
Estonia with Nord Pool and Finnish area 
prices clearly strenghtened towards the 
end of the year.The role of nuclear power uncertain 
after Fukushima accident 
The Fukushima accident in March 2011 
led a number of countries, including Ger -
many, Italy, Switzerland and Belgium, to reconsider their standpoint towards nuclear power. In most cases those deci -
sions coincided with political points of discontinuity like elections, forming a new government, etc. Germany took very 
drastic measures and quickly decided to 
close down all its nuclear power plants by 2022. Eight reactors were immediately 
closed down.  
The EU also responded very quickly 
to the events in Japan. In May, the Com -
mission agreed upon the methodology 
and timetable for the so-called EU nuclear safety stress tests. The purpose 
of the stress tests is to assess whether 
the current safety margins are sufficient to cover various unexpected events. In 2011, global economic activity slowed and the 
european sovereign debt crisis got much of the political and market attention. furthermore, the fukushima accident led a number of countries to reconsider their 
standpoint towards nuclear energy, therefore increasing 
the uncertainty of energy sector’s investments.

It is too early to conclude, whether 
the Fukushima accident was an end of the so-called nuclear renaissance that was springing up throughout the world. 
Several new investments in Western 
European countries are on hold and delayed as a result of increased investor 
risks, challenges in fi  nancing new proj-
ects and expected new safety measures. In many Central and Eastern European 
countries, however, interest in new 
nuclear power has increased.
investment challenge grows
Power utilities continued delivering according to their strategies announced 
the previous year, with the repeating 
themes of strengthening the balance sheet and executing effi  ciency pro-
grammes. As a consequence, many utili-
ties divested parts of their assets during the year. Reducing CO
2 exposure also 
remained high on the utilities’ agenda, 
despite the uncertainty. Due to the phase 
out of nuclear power in some countries and increasing shares of intermittent 
renewable energy sources, hydro assets 
are looking even more attractive than before. Power utilities also formed part-
nerships for participation in large-scale 
renewable energy investments, such as offshore wind power.NOrdIC ElECTrICITy MarkET
Electricity market covers the generation, 
trans mission, distribution and sales of electricity. 
Electricity production and sales are competitive businesses, while electricity transmission and distribution are regulated. 
The Nordic countries were the fi  rst to establish 
a regional, multinational electricity wholesale market. about three quarters of the electricity produced in the Nordic countries is traded on the Nordic electricity exchange (Nord Pool Spot). The producers use the rest of the electricity themselves or sell it directly to big industrial customers. There are about 350 players in the Nordic wholesale electricity markets. The balance of supply and demand, the price of fuel and emissions allowances and the hydrological situation affect the wholesale price. as the market is very volatile, both buyers and sellers can also hedge power prices with fi  nancial contracts. 
Electricity transmission and distribution 
companies operate regionally because it is not cost-effi  cient to build multiple electricity networks in the same area. authorities monitor electricity transmission and distribution, its costs and the business practices of the companies. The transmission and distribution companies must treat all electricity producers and buyers equally, regardless of the producer or buyer of the electricity they are transmitting. 
Electricity retailers buy their electricity mainly 
from the NordPool Spot and sell it to house holds 
and companies. The retail price is mostly 
affected by the wholesale price. It is also subject to taxes and other fees by authorities, including subsidies for renewable energy.  
ElECTrICITy MarkET IN ruSSIa  
The russian wholesale electricity market has been liberalised from the beginning of 2011. all generating companies continue to sell a part of their electricity and capacity equalling the consumption of households under regulated 
prices. Ho useholds account for about 10% of the 
wholesale markets.
In addition to the electricity wholesale electricity 
market, russia also has an electricity capacity market, in which an electricity producer receives earnings for the production capacity it offers for market use. The purpose of the electricity capacity market is mainly to encourage new investments in electricity production. 
The long -term capacity market rules were 
approved by the russian Government in 2010 and have been applied from the beginning of 2011. The so-called old capacity, built before 2007, will compete in competitive capacity selection. The fi  rst competitive capacity selection in accordance with the new rules of the long- term capacity market was held in december 2010. The new generation capacity, built after 2007 under government Capacity Supply agreements (CSa), will receive guaranteed payments for a period of 10 years. Prices for 
capacity under CSA are defi  ned to ensure a suffi  cient return on investments. nordic ElEcTriciTy marKET sTrucTurEfortum SuStAINABILItY report 2011 SuStAINABILItY INteGrAteD IN StrAteGY  31

As energy has become much more

a common challenge for both the policy 
makers and the energy sector. 
Eu energy policy proceeds
The term of the EU Commission is approaching its midpoint, which means that it is in a hurry to put forth propos-
als that it wants adopted before its term 
is over. The European Commission pre-sented its Energy Strategy for 2011–2020 
in November 2010. The strategy builds 
on fi  ve priorities with which the EU aims to meet its 2020 energy and climate 
targets: energy effi  ciency, energy market 
integration, empowered consumers, safety and security, technology and 
innovation leadership, and the external 
dimension of the EU energy policy. 
Fortum welcomed the overall 
approach of the strategy and especially the strong emphasis put on the comple-
tion of the internal energy market. In 
Fortum’s opinion, a competitive and 
properly functioning internal energy 
market is a source of effi  ciency gains and is essential for achieving the environ-
mental and security of supply goals – and 
at the lowest cost to society. Fortum also believes that the EU internal energy 
market development should lead to more 
effi  cient policy coordination between the EU member states and, ideally, towards 
harmonisation of all relevant energy 
market-related legislation. 
EU energy policy was given new 
impetus in February, when the fi  rst-ever energy-specifi  c European Council meet-ing was held. Besides endorsing the new 
strategy, the heads of EU states decided 
to accelerate the timetable for the imple-mentation of the internal energy market, 
which should now be in place by 2014. 
In March 2011, the Commission pre-
sented an energy-effi  ciency action plan, which was followed by a proposal for a 
new energy-effi  ciency directive in June. The controversial proposal contains, among other things, an obligation for 
energy suppliers or distribution compa-
nies (to be decided nationally) to achieve 1.5% annual energy savings among their 
customers. The proposal also strongly 
promotes combined heat and power (CHP) as an energy-effi  cient technology. 
The ambitious aim is to fi  nalise the 
directive at the end of 2012, after which the member states would have one year 
to transpose it into their national legisla-
tion. In 2014, the Commission will assess In Fortum’s opinion, a 
competitive and properly 
functioning internal 
energy market is a source of effi  ciency gains and is 
essential for achieving the 
environmental and security 
of supply goals – and at the 
lowest cost to society. An increasing number of new inves-
tors has entered the utility sector – they 
are attracted by renewable energy poli-
cies with fi  xed feed-in-tariffs as well as power utilities’ divestments of regulated 
businesses, such as distribution and 
transmission networks. Infrastructure funds and pension insurers are now 
competing in businesses that have been 
traditionally seen as a playing fi  eld for large utilities. 
Energy policies high 
on global agenda 
There were many elections that affected 
energy policies all around the world in 
2011. In Fortum’s operating areas, Fin-
land, Estonia, Latvia, Poland and Russia held parliamentary elections in 2011. 
Major changes took place for example in 
Finland, where the government coalition changed considerably. The programme 
of the new government, consisting of six 
parties, took a negative stand towards new nuclear permits, and also proposes to 
investigate the possibility of windfall and 
uranium tax in spite of the fact that pre-vious governments have considered such 
taxes legally questionable and counter-
productive to energy and climate policy targets, since they would encourage the 
use of fossil fuels and electricity imports. 
The presidential elections in 2012 in 
Russia and the US were also visible in policymaking: in Russia, many impor-
tant decisions, including some affecting energy tariffs, were put off until the 
elections. The upcoming election in the fortum SuStAINABILItY report 2011 SuStAINABILItY INteGrAteD IN StrAteGY  33   80100120140

if needed, binding energy-efficiency 
targets for the member states. Energy 
efficiency is an undisputed policy target, but finding concrete tools to promote it 
has been problematic for the policy mak -
ers and this is clearly visible also in the 
Commission’s proposal for a new direc -
tive. It is nevertheless among issues that Fortum is committed to turn into a com -
petitive edge, especially by concentrating 
on energy-efficient CHP production.
In June 2011, the Commission pub -
lished its proposal on the multiannual financial framework (2014–2020) with 
an idea to shift the EU financing more towards implementing the strategic goals relating, e.g., to climate, energy and 
research. Based on this thinking, the 
Commission tabled several sector-spe -
cific financing proposals in 2011, such as 
a proposal on infrastructure financing 
(Connecting Europe Facility), including energy networks, and a proposal for 
the next research and innovation pro -
gramme (EU Horizon 2020). Fortum sup -
ports the use of EU financing in energy infrastructure investments of common 
interest and energy-related research activities, including demonstation of new 
technologies.  Electricity market models 
sparked discussions
The completion of the European internal 
energy market was progressing, but some -
what incoherently. The target date for the implementation of the so-called 3rd inter -
nal energy market legislation was 3 March 
2011. Only a few member states were able 
to meet the target date; in September, the Commission opened infringement pro -
cedures against 17 member states for not implementing the package in time. 
The market coupling development 
however progressed. European power exchanges and transmission system operators agreed to start a common price 
calculation for the Nordic and Central 
Western European markets by the end of 2012. The present so-called volume cou -
pling was also enhanced during 2011 by 
incuding the Norway–Netherlands NorNed 
cable and the new UK–Netherlands Brit -
Ned Interconnector to it.  
Many countries have started to rea -
lise the impacts of a larger penetration 
of intermittent and subsidised renew -
able energy on the market. Increasing 
the amount of such production in the 
market reduces the profitability of con -
ventional capacity, although this capacity 
is needed to alleviate the fluctuations of 
intermittent solar and wind energy. For 
some countries, the main problem is to maintain reserve and back-up capacity in 
the market; for other countries, the main 
issue is guaranteeing incentives for new low-carbon investments. Some member states have begun to 
tackle these challenges through national 
policy instruments, such as capacity 
remuneration mechanisms, which do not fit within the so-called energy-only 
market design that forms the basis of 
European electricity market. Energy utili -
ties have aggressively addressed the dis -
crepancy between the two approaches in an effort to draw the attention of the EU Commission to this development. Utili -
ties are of the opinion that the approved legislation should first be implemented properly and that if additional capacity 
mechanisms are subsequently needed, 
they should be prepared at the EU level. Different national and hence incompat -
ible capacity mechanisms would be the 
worst outcome with a potential to com -
pletely ruin the achievements in terms of 
internal electricity market.
The Russian electricity market 
reform, in turn, progressed as planned 
and, as of 1 January 2011, the wholesale 
market has functioned in a market-
based manner. But also in Russia, 
where the dual market – electricity and capacity – is in use, the need to further 
develop the market model was discussed 
actively at the beginning of the year. The direction there is contrary to that in the 
EU, as the overwhelming idea is to move 
towards an energy-only market, also supported by Fortum. Furthermore, it 
was noted that the wholesale electricity 
market shall not be viewed separately; instead, its connections with other mar -
kets, like retail electricity and heat mar -Fortum supports the use

electricity market was divided into four 
different bidding zones as a result of the 
decision of the European Commission in order to avoid bottle-necks on the Swed -
ish–Danish border. The consequence of this is that electricity prices for consum -
ers and producers will differ depending 
on the geographical location within the 
country. It is also expected that the divi -
sion will decrease the number of active 
retailers in each bidding zone, due to 
higher risk and costs. This is an example of poorly coordinated decisions that 
affect negatively both the wholesale and 
retail markets.
better transparency in the heat sector
In February 2011, an investigation on Third Party Access (TPA), i.e., competi -
tion in the district heating grid was com -
pleted in Sweden. The investigation also included a legal proposal to implement 
TPA. Most stakeholders have criticised 
the proposal for putting security of heat delivery at risk, increasing the costs and not benefitting the final customer. In 
Fortum’s opinion, more transparent pric -
ing is the way to go forward in order to 
increase confidence in heat pricing.
In Russia, a federal law on heat sup -
ply came into force on 1 January 2011, providing a general framework for the 
functioning of heat companies. In order 
to be enacted in practice, the law presup -
poses the implementation of 31 sub-laws. 
The process to develop those sub-laws 
started in 2011 and is expected to be In Finland, the implementation of 
smart, hourly metering proceeded dur -

August 2012, on a voluntary base. In Norway, 
a decision was made in June 2011 to install smart meters for all customers by 2017. In 
addition to hourly metering, many countries 
have started to consider additional incen -
tives for smart grid investments. 
development of the n ordic 
retail market continued
The process to develop a harmonised Nor -
dic retail market for electricity continued 
under the leadership of NordREG, the 
association of Nordic energy regulators. In 2011, clear progress was made in some key 
issues, such as a proposal to make the sup -
plier the customer’s main point of contact. 
The work is based on the task given by the 
Nordic Energy Ministers with the aim to 
implement a common Nordic retail market by 2015. The goal of the integrated Nordic 
retail market is to promote efficiency, 
increase competition, choice for custom -
ers and enhance the demand response by 
prompt reflection of price signals from the 
electricity wholesale markets. In addition, consumers will be able to choose their 
electricity supplier from any of the Nordic 
countries. Fortum sees the need to develop electricity retail markets in all countries

Achieving politically set targets regard -

mission networks by 2020. This would 
require regulation that encourages 
investments. 
During 2011, regulatory authorities 
both in Finland and Sweden adopted 
new regulatory models applicable to 
distribution business for the four-year period 2012–2015. In both countries, 
the distribution industry assessed the 
regulatory model as being insufficient in terms of guaranteeing reasonable 
rate of return for distribution network 
investments, and launched court 
appeals against the regulatory model.36 SuStAINABILIt Y INte GrAteD IN S trAteGY fortum  SuStAINABILIt Y report  2011rEGulaTEd HEaTING B uSINESS 
Heating, as well as the emerging cooling 
business, is local and  subject to local 
legislation and regulation. The differences in approaches are considerable due to different backgrounds and the varying importance of district heating. In Sweden and Finland, district heating prices are set to be competitive with other heating methods. In all other countries where Fortum has district heating operations, some form of price regulation exists. Fortum as the fourth biggest heat producer in the world pays a lot of attention to the development of the heat sector regulation. It has obvious influence on Fortum’s business but also on the competitiveness of district heating in general.mentally oriented EU Parliament was not 
unanimous in tightening the target. 
Lack of progress in global climate 
negotiations and unclarity with regard to 
EU policy measures water down the com -
petitiveness of early movers in climate 
change mitigation. Even though the EU 
roadmaps in general are supportive of 
Fortum’s low-carbon strategy, overlapping and conflicting policy measures in terms 
of CO
2 reductions, renewable energy 
sources and energy efficiency are water -
ing down the effectiveness of each other. 
Fortum would rather see the carbon price to steer energy production in a sustain -
able direction.
EU emissions trading rules fixed
The implementation of the EU’s Emis -
sions Trading Directive for 2013–2020 
has almost been completed. The bench -
marking rules for free allocation were 
approved, and the installations had to 
apply for the allowances in autumn 2011. 
Poland and Estonia, together with 8 other member states, are applying for deroga -
tion, enabling free allocation also for electricity production; as a rule, however, power generation will not receive any free 
allowances after 2012. The rules of allow -
ance auctioning were finalised, and the 
first auctions are expected during 2012.
The EU Emissions Trading System 
continues to be the only major regional 
trading scheme. The price of CO 2 in the EU 
in 2011 decreased significantly from 2010 without any single, clear legal or political 
reason. It appears that economic situation completed in 2012. Fortum is co-oper -
ating actively both with market partici -
pants and government agencies to ensure transparent and predictable rules on the heat market and is closely involved in the 
preparation of the sub-laws. 
The EU’s renewable energy targets 
and the need to improve fuel diversity have increased the demand for biomass 
in Poland. In addition to wood residues and agro-based biomass, also munici -
pal waste is becoming an opportunity especially for CHP; currently over 90% of waste is put into landfills. New legisla -
tion in Poland on waste management, adopted in 2011, opens an opportunity for investments in waste-to-energy plants. To meet the EU requirements, 
land filling will have to be signifi -
cantly reduced and other ways of waste 
treatment must be developed. Waste-
to-energy plants are among the key 
solutions currently being considered by larger cities in Poland.    
global climate deal pending 
The international climate negotiations continued throughout 2011, but the 17th 
Conference of the Parties (COP17) in Dur -
ban, South Africa, in late 2011 resulted 
in only modest progress. Consequently, 
the second commitment period under 
the Kyoto Protocol seems to include only the EU and a couple of small other par -
ties, and negotiations on a legal global agreement are expected to continue for years. For carbon markets, this means that relevant measures like trading sys -
tems will be national or regional, though potentially interlinked. When it comes 
to flexibility mechanisms, the Clean 
Development Mechanism (CDM) will continue after 2012, but no new emission 
reductions from Joint Implementation 
(JI) are likely after 2012, as these units are linked to the Kyoto period.
Eu roadmaps paving the way 
to a low-carbon economy
During 2011, the Commission published four different “2050 Roadmaps”: low-
carbon economy roadmap, white paper 
on transport policy, resource efficiency roadmap and lastly, energy roadmap. 
The aim of the roadmaps is to present 
sector-specific pathways for achieving 
a 
competitive low-carbon economy by 2050.  
The present EU targets for CO 2 reduction 
and renewable energy are set up to 2020 
and the political discussion on possible 
milestones for reaching the 2050 target 
is expected to start during 2012.
All roadmaps emphasise EU-level 
policy steering and the increase of bind -
ing targets. The EU is targeting an 80–95% 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 with interim targets for 2030 (–40%) 
and 2040 (–60%). This would mean that the 
power sector would be virtually CO
2-free 
by 2050. 
In June, Poland blocked the further 
processing of the 2050 low-carbon road -
map. Poland emphasised the competitive -
ness of EU industries over the climate targets. Even the usually very environ -fortum S uStAINABILIt Y report 2011  SuStAINABILIt Y INte GrAteD IN S trAteGY 37   and the unclarity of EU’s climate targets 
and tools as well as their overlapping 
nature are reasons for low CO 2 price. The 
low CO 2 price decreases incentives for low-
emitting production.  
Emerging trading schemes 
Emissions trading schemes are evolving 
also in other parts of the world. Although the US has repeatedly failed to pass fed -
eral climate legislation, regional trading 
schemes like the Regional Greenhouse 
Gas Initiative (RGGI) are in operation in 
a number of states and expanding. China has announced to launch a national car -
bon trading scheme by around 2015 in order to cut its economy’s carbon intensity by 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2020. In 
November, Australia approved legislation 
that will introduce a tax on carbon emis -
sions from 2012 and move to an emissions 
trading scheme in 2015. price for co2 through J i in russia
In Russia, climate policy is explicitly 
linked to economic interests, in particular 
to energy efficiency. There are no binding 
obligations for companies to reduce emis -
sions and no price or market for CO 2. The 
only economic value for CO 2 is related to 
Joint Implementation projects. During 
2011, the regulation on the selection of JI 
projects was changed from a tendering to a continuous approval process.
divergent support schemes for 
renewables continue within the E u
In January, the Commission tabled a prog -
ress report on renewable energy in the EU 
and a communication on the financing of 
renewable energy sources (RES). The report will possibly lead to an assessment of the 
RES Directive earlier than in 2014, as 
originally planned. The Commission will address the impact of different RES sup -
port schemes on the electricity market in 2012. According to the national renewable 
energy action plans the consumption of 
RES in EU-27 would be 20.7% in 2020 (tar -
get 20%). The member states will give their 
next progress report by mid-2012 which 
will give a new outlook for the 20% target. 
Divergent national support schemes 
are likely to result in subsidy competition and market distortions and retroactive changes of schemes in a few EU member 
states with increased investment risk. 
However, regional co-operation on RES support is also evolving: Norway and Swe -
den became the first countries to establish a common certificate system starting in January 2012. The system is planned to 
stimulate the development of 26.4 terawatt-
hours (TWh) of new renewable electricity in the two countries by 2020. 
The Finnish feed-in tariff scheme for 
wind power and electricity from wood 
fuel and biogas entered into force in 
March. The new Finnish Government, however, aims to cut the renewable energy 
support significantly outside the feed-in 
tariff  system by 2015.  
The EU Commission is expected to 
release a legislative proposal for sustain -
ability criteria for solid biomass in early 2012. Fortum’s position on the sustainable 
use of bioenergy is presented on page 70.
Evolving environmental 
legislation on hydropower 
According to the EU Water Framework 
Directive (WFD) adopted in 2000, all 
European waters must achieve a good eco -
logical and chemical status by 2015. The countries reported the river basin man -
agement plans and action programmes to the Commission in 2010; in Finland, 
regional implementation plans for these action programmes were prepared during 
2011. In Sweden, the preparation of plans 
was delayed. The majority of the rivers and regulated lakes in the water system 
area of Fortum’s hydropower plants in 
Finland meet the environmental target of the directive, while improvement mea -
sures might be needed in Sweden.
National implementation of the EU 
Floods Directive is under way and could 
impact hydropower production in Swe -
den and Finland. In addition, the EU is 
preparing a regulation on Baltic salmon 
protection actions. The proposal aims at 
improving naturally reproduced salmon populations and decreasing salmon stock -
ings and would significantly change the methods used for mitigating the environ -
mental impact of hydropower on fisheries. 
This proposal is likely to face resistance 
from countries around the Baltic Sea.
In Finland, the Water Act renewal has 
been finalised and the new law enters into force at the beginning of 2012. It has no major impacts on the operational environ -
ment of hydropower, but it may stream -
line licensing procedures.
setting future requirements 
for thermal energy 
In January, the EU Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) entered into force. The 
member states have two years to imple -
ment it into their national legislation. The price of CO2 in the EU in 
2011 decreased significantly 
from 2010 without any single, 
clear legal or political reason.38 SuStAINABILIt Y INte GrAteD IN S trAteGY fortum  SuStAINABILIt Y report  2011In particular, the directive substantially 
tightens the emissions limits on sulphur 
dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particles in 
all thermal energy production plants from 2016 onwards. The directive also requires 
the use of Best Available Technology (BAT) 
and more precise monitoring and report-ing of emissions. The review of the Best 
Available Techniques Reference Document 
(BREF) for Large Combustion Plants (LCP) began in 2011 and is expected to last up to 
three years. In the future, the BREF will 
serve as the reference for setting the per-mit conditions by the national authorities. 
The IED tightens the emissions 
requirements for all of Fortum’s thermal 
plants. A more precise cost effect of the 
requirements will become clear after the plant-specifi  c permit conditions have been 
defi  ned. The cost effect also depends on 
how fl  exibilities are applied in national legislation and at the plant level.
In Finland, a revision of the Environ-
mental Protection Law started in 2011; in 
addition to implementation of the IED, it 
aims at coordinating the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and licensing 
procedures. The Waste Law was adopted and 
will enter into force in spring 2012. The new law classifi  es ash and gypsum as products 
instead of waste, thus facilitating utilisation 
of these energy production by-products.
with rising energy demands, increasingly scarce natural resources 
and growing pressure on commodity prices, inves-
tors require timely corporate information on 
climate change to help assess the long-term security of their portfolios. at the same time, 
there is signifi  cant low-carbon growth 
potential that brings opportunities. Fortum 
was listed as sector leader in the Carbon 
disclosure leadership Index in 2011, which demonstrates good internal data manage-
ment practices and transparent disclosure of 
greenhouse gas emissions. The organisations 
that give clear consideration to measur-
ing and reporting on climate change issues will be best 
placed to capitalise on the op-
portunities from managing them.STakEHOldEr vIEw:

combustion of fuels is the main source 
of energy. The traditional energy system 
results in an environmental burden and has a low total efficiency. As the global 
demand for energy – and particularly 
electricity consumption – is rapidly grow -
ing, the mitigation of climate change 
is becoming an increasingly important 
issue. Population growth will intensify competition for exhaustible natural 
resources, and therefore the use of limited 
resources and energy systems must be made more efficient.
Solar Economy provides solutions 
to the challenges of climate change and resource scarcity. In Solar Economy, 
there is no scarcity regarding the energy 
source: the energy from the sun during a Economy is based on high resource and system efficiency and on power and heat production driven by an emissions-free 
and inexhaustible energy source. Electric -
ity as an energy carrier enables high sys -
tem efficiency and is taking an increasing share in the energy system.
In Solar Economy, the energy system is 
more dynamic and intelligent, always allo -
cating resources in the most efficient way. 
This means for example using the cheap -
est possible production form. Electricity 
is produced in locations where the condi -
tions are the most favourable in terms 
of the primary energy source and from 
a total system efficiency point of view. 
Electricity is generated both centrally and in a distributed manner. Characteristic of 
the system is that the electricity load also fortum’s long-term aspiration is to be a carbon dioxide-

Towards Solar Economy
single day would be enough to meet the 
total annual energy demand globally. An 
inexhaustible supply of energy from the 
sun thus enables a rise in the standard of living in developing countries while 
reducing the environmental burden.
Today’s energy system is not only 
traditional but also advanced, resource-efficient technologies coexist with the 
traditional ones. Even energy from the sun is widely utilised in the form of, e.g., 
hydropower and bioenergy.
In Fortum’s view, the pathway towards 
Solar Economy will proceed step-by-step as the technology and society develops. 
The current energy production forms are likely to be utilised until they are no 
longer financially feasible and until the 
power plants have reached the end of their life-cycles. Along the way, advanced energy technologies, like biomass-based com -
bined heat and power (CHP) production, will become important. Nuclear power will remain alongside the new forms of 
energy, and its development will also 
continue. For example, small-scale nuclear power plants with passive safety solutions will be developed.
Solar Economy is a flexible 
and smart energy system
Solar Economy is not based solely on one 
fuel or technology, it offers diverse oppor -
tunities. Energy from the sun will be used either directly as solar electricity or heat, or indirectly as hydro, ocean, wind and 
bioenergy and geothermal energy. Solar EMISSIONS IN S TOCkHOlM’S

wwF’s vision is based on an energy system in 
which less energy is consumed and all the en-
ergy is produced from renewable sources. This 
includes strict sustainability standards especially 
for biomass based energy, a phase-out of nuclear 
power latest by 2050 and 
decrease of global energy 
demand by 15% com-
pared to 2005 level. It is 
a vision that challenges 
Fortum’s progressive 
Solar Economy think-ing to take one step 
further to an energy 
system that respects 
the boundaries of the 
planet. a combined 
system of central and 
distributed production 
based on renew-able energy is signifi  cantly more sustainable – both environmentally and economically – than our 
current system. Transitioning to a smarter system 
is advantageous, but it also requires a lot. 
Technology has a role in the transition to Solar 
Economy and in the related energy solutions, and most of the necessary technology already exists. 
So it is a matter of commercialisation and large-
scale adoption of the existing technology. This re-quires political will, innovative companies and big 
lifestyle changes. In western countries, the con-
sumption of beef, for example, should be cut in half by 2050. and other natural resources must be 
used more sparingly: reduce, reuse and recycle. 
reduction is the key to sustainable societies. 
all forms of energy production have negative 
externalities in terms of the environment. That 
is why improving energy effi  ciency and energy 
conservation will play a key role in the future energy system.Liisa rohweder, 
CEO, WWF Finlandadjusts to production. With the change, 
electricity consumers can also be electric-
ity producers – customers become active 
players with more ability to track and adjust their electricity usage and its fi  nan-
cial and ecological implications. 
Increasing the share of renewable 
energy and decentralised energy in the future energy system means more vola-
tility in energy production and energy fl  owing both directions. The two-way 
transmission of electricity requires 
investments in smart grids. In Solar Economy, energy can be stored, transmit-
ted even long distances and used fl  exibly 
based on need. 
Development of the smart societies of 
Solar Economy also requires collaboration between many sectors, for example the energy producers, information technol-
ogy, transportation and construction. In 
addition to smart energy production and distribution, the future urban energy 
system is characterised by eco-effi  cient 
construction, electric transportation, and smart heating and cooling solutions. 
In the future energy system, electricity 
will replace other energy sources, e.g., in transport. 
The transition towards Solar Economy 
requires not only research and innova-tion, investments and technology develop-
ment and commercialisation, but also 
smart solutions on energy markets and in governance. This means consistent 
policies and joint target-setting of vari-
ous parties (e.g. politicians, industry) in the society. A regulatory framework that STakEHOldEr vIEw: 42 SuStAINABILItY INteGrAteD IN StrAteGY fortum SuStAINABILItY report 2011supports open, transparent, competitive 
electricity wholesale and retail markets 
in the long run is a prerequisite. Environ -
mental and energy policy steering should 
be market-based and harmonised, thereby 
guaranteeing the optimal use of renew -
able and resource-efficient production at 
the lowest cost to society. The end result 
is an ecologically and socially sustainable 
and cost-efficient future energy system.
Fortum’s approach to 
solar Economy
The ambition towards low-emitting 
energy production has been part of For -
tum’s strategy for a long time. In 2011, around 65% of Fortum’s total electricity production and 85% of the company’s elec -
tricity production in the EU was CO
2-free. 
At the moment, Fortum uses a variety of 
energy sources and production technolo -
gies in its energy production. The compa -
ny’s large-scale, emissions-free electricity production technologies are hydropower 
and nuclear power. These will continue to be the cornerstone in Fortum’s electricity 
production for a long time to come. Bio -
fuels and waste-derived fuels constitute 
a significant share of the fuels in CHP 
and heat production. Fortum also utilises 
fossil fuels on a large scale, especially in Russia, where energy production is based 
on natural gas and coal. Read more on 
the roles of production technologies in the transition towards Solar Economy on 
pages 47–49 (hydropower), 50–53 (nuclear 
power) and 54–57 (CHP).FaST dEvElOPMENT  IN 
SOlar TECHNOl OGy 
during the last few years, solar technologies 
have advanced much quicker than expected. 
In 2011, 21 gigawatts (G w) of solar 
photovoltaic (P v) power was installed in the 
Eu. This is the equivalent of all other power 
capacity additions in the E u last year. It is 
estimated that 15% of Europe’s electricity could be produced with solar power and 20% with wind power by 2020. 
The cost of photovoltaic (P v) technology 
has been falling by 20–40% annually.  How 
widely and quickly it will be adopted depends largely on government incentives and regulation. Energy storage will be essential for the penetration of P v. Photovoltaics need 
to be connected to the grid to sell excess energy or to have some possibility for local storage. Smart metering is also required in Fortum believes that it is possible to 
make a transition from traditional energy 
production and utilisation of exhaustible 
energy sources towards Solar Economy. The transition will happen gradually in 
tandem with the renovation of produc -
tion capacity and the construction of new 
capacity. In addition to hydro and nuclear 
power, high-efficiency technologies, like 
gas- and multifuel-based CHP, will provide a significant contribution when Fortum 
gradually transforms its energy produc -
tion towards Solar Economy. 
Fortum already has many elements 
of Solar Economy in its production fleet. 
In addition to hydropower, these include bioenergy and wind power. Fortum is also actively researching many future Solar 
Economy production technologies, such 
as wave power, solar power and solar heat. Fortum has been participating in several 
projects to develop solar power and heat 
technologies and is moving from the research-only phase to priming for actual 
commercial operations in direct solar 
energy. Fortum is also actively contribut -
ing to the development of future solutions to customers. These include smart grids, innovative heating and cooling solutions, 
sustainable cities and electrification of 
transportation. Read more about Fortum’s Solar Economy related investments,

some of their own energy and feeding their surplus back into the grid.
The maturity of P v has already been reached 
in many countries that have good solar 
conditions and fairly high electricity prices. This refers to the point at which it becomes profitable for electricity customers to install, e.g., P v modules on their homes and produce 
their own electricity, rather than buying from the utility.
Current projections indicate that solar energy 
might be able to compete against other energy sources, such as wind power, gas turbines, and even nuclear, in large-scale production as early as at the end of this decade in many regions.fortum S uStAINABILIt Y report 2011  SuStAINABILIt Y INte GrAteD IN S trAteGY 43   44 towArDS SoLAr eCoNomY 2 fortum SuStAINABILItY report 2011

Fortum’s main research and develop-
ment (r&d) themes cover the most advanced technologies in the current energy system and the technologies and system solutions that will be needed to enable future Solar Economy. For example, a strong focus in 2011 was on researching the potential of various solar technologies. Fortum also teamed 
up with partners to develop smart 
grid technologies, sustainable urban solutions, and new integrated combined heat and power (CHP) concepts. read more on Fortum’s r&d on pages 65–66 and future solutions for customers on pages 75–77.  
at the same time, Fortum aims to 
satisfy customer needs by offering them environmentally-benign energy 
products that provide an opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint. More and more private customers and companies 
are demanding that the electricity 
they buy comes with a guarantee of origin, i.e., information about how the electricity is produced. The increased demand for origin-certifi  ed electricity is a competitive advantage for Fortum in Finland and Sweden . read more on

ENERG y PRODUCTION46 towArDS SmArter e NerGY pro DuCtIoN fortum S uStAINABILI tY report 2011Hydropower is the most common and 
proven renewable energy technology and 
plays an important role in global power 
generation. CO 2-free and renewable hydro -
power is one of the key solutions in miti -
gating climate change and in the saving of scarce  natural resources. Hydropower 
draws its essential energy from the sun, 
which drives the continuous hydrologi -
cal cycle. According to the International 
Energy Agency (IEA), hydropower repre -
sents more than 90% of all global renew -
able energy production and continues to prevail as one of the most viable sources 
of new generation in the future energy 
system – Solar Economy. 
In the Nordic electricity market, 
hydropower plays a key role in balancing the production and consumption of elec -
tricity. Hydropower plant start-up, regula -
tion and shutdown is quick, and water stored in the reservoirs helps to balance the fluctuations in consumption. Hydro -
power’s role in balancing production and consumption will be emphasised in Solar Economy, where an increasingly bigger 
share of electricity is produced with, e.g., 
wind and solar power. It also provides an option to store energy and to optimise 
electricity generation. Hydropower is both 
part of the traditional energy system and 
a major production technology in Solar 
Economy.Fortum’s hydropower
Fortum has a proven track record of efficient and sustainable hydropower 
production in Sweden and Finland. The 
company is one of the biggest hydro -
power producers and has long-term 
experience in the planning, refurbishing, 
operation and maintenance of hydro -
power plants in the Nordic countries.
About one third of Fortum’s annual 
electricity production is based on hydro -
power. The share varies every year based 
on the hydrological situation. Fortum’s 
hydropower capacity in the Nordic countries is nearly 4,700 MW with 260 
fully- or partly-owned hydropower plants 
in Sweden and Finland. More than 80% of plants are located in central Sweden. 
The plants with the largest capacity are 
situated on the Dalälven, Indalsälven, Ljusnan and Vuoksi, Kemijoki and Oulu -
joki rivers. 
hydropower refurbishments 
continued in 2011 
In 2011, Fortum generated 21.o TWh of hydropower in the Nordic countries. 
Also the implemention of the long-term 
refurbishment programme of existing hydropower capacity continued. 
In 2011, hydropower refurbishment 
projects were completed at the Montta plant in Finland, and at the Edsforsen, Eldforsen, Bergvik and Järpströmmen 
plants in Sweden. These refurbishments 
will result in additional annual electric -
ity production of about 32 gigawatt-hours 
(GWh). Refurbishment projects generally 
result in positive impacts on environment, as the modern technology allows increas -
ing efficiency without increasing adverse environmental effects. Most of refurbish -
ment measures are carried out inside the 
hydropower plant (replacement of existing 
turbines etc). Furthermore, they increase safety and decrease environmental risks, 
e.g., oil leakage due to a smaller volume 
of oil in new turbines. For example, the amount of hydraulic oil in Montta was 
decreased thanks to the environmentally 
safe runners. Also new self-lubricated guide vane bearings were mounted.
Fortum also continued preparations 
for participating in the tendering process 
for hydropower concessions in France.   climate change adaptation 
studied within hydropower
In addition to climate change mitiga -
tion, Fortum is also taking measures to adapt its operations to climate change. 
In 2011, a study regarding the impacts of climate change on hydrology in rivers 
with Fortum’s hydropower in Sweden 
and Finland was finalised. The study analysed the changes in hydrology on 
Fortum’s hydropower production and 
identified measures needed to adapt to hydrological changes.
On the grounds of the climate sce -
narios studied, the timing of inflows is 
changing in Finnish and Swedish rivers. 
Some changes are being implemented in inflow forecasting due to increasing win -
ter inflows and decreasing spring inflows. Historical discharge duration curves as well as discharge duration curves for 
the future will be considered in invest -Hydro power’s role in Solar Economy
Hydropower is the most common and proven renewable energy technology and 
plays an important role in global power generation. In 2011, f ortum generated 21.0 
terawatt-hours (twh) of hydropower contributing to 29% of the company’s total electricity production.

hydropower non-
compliances down to zero
The licence conditions for Fortum’s 
hydropower plants and lake regulation 
defi  ne the limits for surface water levels 
and fl  ow variations in the watercourse. The permits also defi  ne obligations to 
prevent and to compensate for environ-
mental impacts.   Rapidly changing weather conditions 
or malfunctions in hydropower plants 
can lead to non-compliances of water regulation licences. In 2011, the number 
of non-compliances in Fortum’s hydro-
power plants was zero due to careful operation and improved maintenance. 
The main compensation measure 
for the fi  sh population and fi  shing is to release young fi  sh into rivers, lakes and 
the sea. During 2011, Fortum stocked 
about 346,000 salmon and trout and about 1,800,000 pike perch, grayling 
and lavaret fry in Finland. In Sweden, 
the fi  sh stocking and release was about 540,000 young salmon and trout. Other 
compensation measures for the fi  sh 
population are fi  sh ladders, the catch and transport of fi  sh to spawning areas and a 
combination of these.Key impacts of hydropower
The most signifi  cant impact of hydropower 
on the environment results from the 
construction phase of plants and dams. 
Hydropower may alter a river system and riverside, including its course and natural fl  ows. The key environmental aspects are 
related to the impact on river habitats due 
to the damming of watercourses. 
Annual regulation of lakes and short-
term regulation of rivers affects the sur-
face water levels and fl  ows. This impacts 
the aquatic environment and other use of watercourses. 
Fortum is actively fi  nancing and par-
ticipating in the research of hydropower 
impacts and the mitigation measures in 
Sweden and Finland. 
attention to nature and 
other uses of water
As a consequence of damming, there has 
been a signifi  cant decrease in the habitats 
suitable for migratory and local fi  sh need-
ing rapids for breeding. In most cases, dams have also prevented migrations to 
breeding areas in rivers and back to the 
sea or lake. This has impacted also the 
populations of mussel species depending 
on salmonoids. Improving the natural reproduction of local and migratory fi  sh 
in hydropower rivers as well as the devel-
opment of fi  sh farming are the focus of extensive research at Fortum both in Swe-
den and Finland. The main areas of this 
research include possibilities to restore 48 towArDS SmArter eNerGY proDuCtIoN fortum SuStAINABILItY report 2011Fortum participates in several research 
projects to mitigate the environmental impacts of hydropower. The projects include, e.g., migratory fi  sh routes, smolt migration to the sea, fi  sh restocking as well as enhancing the habitat for fi  sh and endangered fresh-water pearl mussels.  
One of the projects is headed by the 
Finnish Game and Fisheries research Insti-tute. It helps to choose the most effective measures for fi  sh management and to plan improvements in rivers with hydropower. Several interesting case studies are being carried out on the Oulujoki, Iijoki, kemijoki and kymijoki rivers. Fortum is funding the project with Eur 150,000 and uses its own 
expertise to support the research. In the 
project, habitat modelling is being applied to fi  sh migration studies. Planning of the mouth of the fi  sh way, the attraction fl  ows as well as upstream and downstream migration can be simulated with the model and improvement measures can be developed.Fortum is also working with many 
stakeholders to improve the recreational use of the water systems. The most impor-tant local partners in the Oulujoki area include municipalities, local environmental and fi  shery authorities, and fi  shermen. The key form of long-term collaboration in the region is Oulujoki multiple use programme. The programme aims to facilitate mobility 
and fi  shing in the water system and to 
restore habitats and improve landscaping. annual funding for the programme is Eur 300,000, of which Fortum’s share is 45%.Case:
Mitigating effects of hydropower   
in Oulujoki spawning and breeding areas, enhancing 
migration to these areas and back to the 
sea or lake, and possibilities to improve 
fi  sh farming in an effort to enhance smolt survival. In addition, and as part of the 
research, actual measures and plans are 
also being implemented. 
The winter drawdown and low water 
levels of regulated lakes in springtime 
affect spawning grounds. Low water lev-
els in springtime have negative impacts on recretional use of watersystems.
safety improvements of hydropower 
plants and dams
Fortum works systematically to improve 
the safety of its hydropower plants and 
dams. In 2011, Fortum’s dam safety 
activities in Finland included periodical and annual dam safety inspections and 
monitoring of the dams, improvement 
studies of safety arrangements and fea-sibility studies of the dam renovations at 
the Imatra and Peltokoski power plants. 
A major accident risk evaluation project was started in 2011 and aims to develop 
a systematic way of analysing the most 
crucial risks in power plants.
Voluntary measures in water regulation
Fortum regulates many rivers and lakes in Sweden and Finland for hydropower 
production, but in some cases regulation 
also serves other purposes, such as recre-ational use and fl  ood control. Hydropower 
permits regulate how fl  ows are allowed to 
fl  uctuate. In some cases, based on ecologi-cal motivations, so-called minimum fl  ows have been determined to ensure a continu-ous water perimeter meaning that the fl  ow 
is never allowed to fall below a set mini-
mum level. It can be adjusted over time so that it refl  ects the variations of the natural 
fl  ow, but at a lower water level.
Fortum has co-operated with authori-
ties and local interest groups to voluntarily agree on water levels or fl  ows to improve 
the environment and facilitate other uses of the water systems. To support recre-
ational use during summer, voluntary tar-
get values for water levels are set for many lakes. These values are more stringent 
than those specifi  ed in the permits. 
Voluntary measures for fi  shing and 
other recreational use are carried out in co-operation with municipalities and local 
authorities. The Oulujoki multiple use agreement originally signed in 1998 is a 
good example of such voluntary measures. 
It is also important to enable other eco-nomic uses of water, such as professional 
fi  shing and the tourist industry. 
In 2011, Fortum implemented several 
voluntary measures in water regulation. The normal regulation of Lake Vuokki-
järvi in Finland was temporarily changed during the very dry spring season in order 
to reach the voluntary target value for the 
water level. In winter 2011, the annual drawdown of the water level of Lake Runn 
in Dalarna, Sweden, was postponed in 
order to enable ice skating on the lake. The water regulation of the Skifsforsen 
power plant in Vansbro (Vanån and 
Dalälven) was changed in order to make a swimming competition possible. 
fortum SuStAINABILItY report 2011 towArDS SmArter eNerGY proDuCtIoN 49   Nuclear power is an important part of 
the global solution to mitigate climate 
change and to provide a reliable, large-
scale supply of electricity at competitive and predictable costs. Nuclear power 
production does not result in greenhouse 
gas emissions or air pollutants, and it has low greenhouse gas emissions over its 
full life cycle. In a life-cycle comparison, 
the carbon dioxide emissions of nuclear power are at about the same level as 
those of wind, hydro and solar power. 
The sustainable use of nuclear power requires the continuous improvement of 
nuclear safety and a long-term solution 
for nuclear waste.
Nuclear power accounts for 14% of 
global electricity production and 28% in 
the EU. After the Fukushima accident in 
March 2011, new investments in nuclear will be more challenging because of the 
increased investor risks, challenges in 
financing new projects and expected new safety measures. In 2011, a number of 
countries, including Germany, Italy, Swit -zerland and Belgium, started to recon -
sider their standpoint towards nuclear power. Germany decided to close down all 
its nuclear power plants by 2022. 
Despite the uncertainty prevalent in 
a few countries, advanced nuclear energy 
is expected to prevail as an important 
technology in the transition towards Solar Economy. Nuclear power as a CO
2-
free energy technology will be needed 
for a long time, and its efficiency can be 
increased significantly in combined heat and power mode. The use of uranium 
energy content can also be improved 
considerably. 
The development of small- and 
medium-sized reactors is an interesting future trend. Over the years, the size of nuclear reactors has grown to more than 
1,600 megawatts (MW), corresponding 
with the logic of having a centralised power production infrastructure with 
large power plants. Smaller units would 
potentially reduce capital costs and shorten construction time.Fortum’s nuclear power
Nuclear power plays an important role in Fortum’s climate-benign energy produc -
tion. Fortum operates the Loviisa nuclear power plant in Finland and is a co-owner in eight reactors in Finland and Sweden.  
Fortum owns 26% of Teollisuuden Voima 
Oyj (TVO) operating Olkiluoto nuclear power plant  in Finland and in Sweden 
Fortum is a co-owner in Forsmark and 
Oskarshamn nuclear power plants through its holdings in Forsmarks Kraft -
grupp AB (26%) and OKG AB (46%).Based on Fortum’s calculations, 
annually six million tonnes of CO
2 emis -
sions are avoided by producing electric -
ity at the Loviisa nuclear power plant instead of production in a coal condens -
ing power plant. Operating a nuclear 
power plant requires technology know-
how and detailed safety specifications and monitoring. In 2011, nuclear power 
accounted for 34% of Fortum’s total elec -
tricity production.Nuclear power’s role in Solar Economy
Nuclear power provides climate-benign, reliable and large-scale 
supply of electricity at a competitive and predictable costs. In 2011, fortum generated 24.9 terawatt-hours (twh) of nuclear power 
contributing to 34% of the company’s total electricity production.

In 2011, Fortum generated 24.9  terawatt-
hours (TWh) of nuclear power in the Nor-
dic countries. The company continued 
the capacity upgrades at the Forsmark and Oskarshamn nuclear power plants 
in Sweden. Moreover, Fortum decided 
to participate in the fi  nancing of the bidding and engineering phase of TVO’s 
(Teollisuuden Voima Oyj) fourth nuclear 
unit at Olkiluoto, Finland, with a stake corresponding to Fortum’s share in TVO. 
The bidding and engineering phase com-
menced in December 2011. 
2011 was a safe and good production 
year at Fortum’s Loviisa nuclear power 
plant. There were no nuclear or radia-
tion incidents reaching the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) of signifi  cant 
events. The load factor describing Loviisa 
power plant’s availability was 94.3 %, which is very high by international 
comparison, and the plant was in full pro-
duction throughout the operation cycle, except for a short production break at 
Unit 1. The Loviisa power plant produced 
8.06 TWh of electricity, which is about 10% of total electricity production in Finland.
The low- and intermediate-level 
waste repository in connection with the 
Loviisa power plant has been expanded 
in the volume of about 15,000 cubic metres. The expansion increases the 
temporary storage capability of mainte-
nance waste, which improves the waste sorting possibilities and reduces the 
amount of waste to be disposed of. The Safety evaluations were carried out in 
Loviisa and on Fortum’s eight co-owned reactors in Sweden and Finland. The 
stress test addresses the safety of the nuclear power plant in conjunction with 
an earthquake, fl  ood, weather phenom-
ena, and loss of heat sink. It also assesses the operation of the organisation in case 
of a severe accident and how the plant is 
technically equipped to manage that. 
The conclusions indicate that the 
design basis criteria for external events and related safety margins are robust enough at all Fortum’s plants. Measures 
for further safety improvements will 
be implemented within the Loviisa nuclear power plant’s normal annual 
investment programme. The improve-
ments will not have an impact on the availability of the power plant. The 
Swedish and Finnish radiation safety Safety 
evaluations were carried out in Loviisa and on Fortum’s eight co-owned reactors in Sweden and Finland.expansion of the repository will be taken 
into operation in spring 2012.
As the renewal of the Loviisa power 
plant automation progresses, the operat-
ing staff will have improved opportuni-
ties for training and practicing in the new training simulator building. The 
building was completed in February 2011 
and the installation of the simulator sys-tems began in September. It is estimated 
to be ready for use in early 2012.

The key environmental, health and safety 
aspects of nuclear power are related 
to the thermal load of cooling water, 
nuclear waste management, nuclear safety and the risk of a nuclear accident.
Thermal load of cooling water
During 2011, 1,437 million cubic meters of cooling water was used in Loviisa, 
and the thermal load into the sea was 
16 TWh. According to temperature measurements, the cooling water has 
increased the temperature of surface 
water by 1–2 ºC within a distance of 1–2 kilometres from the discharge point.nuclear waste management in l oviisa
The waste generated during the power plant’s operation is treated either in con -
ventional (non-radioactive) or in radioac -
tive waste management. Conventional waste is generated in, for example, the transporting of goods, in office work and 
in food preparation. Radioactive waste is 
categorised by source and original pur -
pose into either low-, medium- or high-
level waste. The low- and medium-level 
waste is disposed of in a waste repository built 110 metres deep in the bedrock of 
Hästholmen in Loviisa.
During 2011, the new waste-drum 
measurement equipment and the mod -
ernised facilities for the handling of 
metal waste were commissioned, and the 
repository was expanded to increase the 
temporary storage capacity of mainte -
nance waste. The project of the handling The conclusions of safety

In addition to stress tests, the national 
Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority in Finland has carried out its own national safety evaluation in cases of power loss, 
exceptional weather and environmental 
conditions. No need for immediate safety improvements was identified. Fortum 
submitted a more detailed study and 
action plan regarding these issues in Loviisa in December 2011. In Sweden, a

Final disposal of nuclear waste
In Finland and Sweden, the legal nuclear companies are responsible for the man -
agement and final disposal of nuclear waste. All nuclear waste created must remain in the countries where generated. 
Globally, Swedish and Finnish nuclear 
companies are in the frontline in imple -
menting geological final repository of 
spent nuclear fuel. The spent nuclear fuel 
from the Loviisa and Olkiluoto nuclear power plants in Finland is handled by 
Posiva Oy, which is owned by Fortum and 
TVO. Spent nuclear fuel will be placed in the final disposal repository in Eurajoki. 
Posiva Oy will submit the construction 
licence application to the Ministry of Employment and the Economy in 2012.52 towArDS SmArter e NerGY pro DuCtIoN fortum S uStAINABILI tY report 2011In Sweden, the Swedish Nuclear 
Fuel and Waste Management Company 
(SKB) implements the fi  nal disposal of 
the spent nuclear fuel from the existing plants. In March 2011, SKB submitted the 
application for the construction of a fi  nal 
disposal repository and encapsulation facility. The repository is planned at Fors-
mark, in the Östhammar municipality.

improving nuclear safety is 
a continuous process
The management of nuclear safety is 
based on the principle of multiple isola-
tion, parallel safety measures, systematic 
maintenance and modernisation, as well as continuous training. Improvement 
of nuclear safety at the Loviisa nuclear 
power plant has been a systematic pro-cess throughout the operation of the 
plant. The implementation of the safety 
measures has constantly decreased the probability of a severe reactor accident.
In 2011, the technical safety improve-
ments at Loviisa included installation 
of new mesh for the containment sump 
strainers and the new independent air-cooled diesel generator that can replace an 
emergency diesel generator of both units.A signifi  cant part of Fortum’s research and 
development (r&d) activities focuses on nuclear power, aiming at fi  rst-class nuclear safety, nuclear waste management and good fuel economy. In 2011, more than half of Fortum’s Eur 38 million r&d expenditure was used for nuclear energy research. In addition to its own research programmes, Fortum participates in 
national research programmes in Finland 
and Sweden.  
Fortum has improved the safety of the 
loviisa power plant extensively since the plant started its operations. as a result, the management of severe accidents has improved signifi  cantly. 
In spring 2011, the nuclear accident in 
Fukushima raised a lot of concern about nuclear safety globally. after the accident, Fortum immediately started additional safety assessment in loviisa. The assess-ment found that, regarding evaluated external events, the loviisa power plant’s design basis is proper and the existing technical solutions and safety margins are suffi  cient. Based on the assessment, howe-Case:

ver, Fortum identifi  ed some possibilities to 
further improve safety by, e.g., securing seawater cooling with air cooling, and securing of the fuel pond cooling in case of exceptionally long lasting accident situations.
In Finland, the nuclear power com-
pany bears the responsibility for the management of the radioactive waste 
produced in its own nuclear power plants. Fortum and TvO (Teollisuuden voima Oyj) 
cooperate in the fi  nal disposal of high-level radioactive waste so that the long-term safety requirements can be met. as part of the study, a research space, ONkalO (cavity), at Olkiluoto is mined underground (about –400 m) in the bed-rock. The bedrock is examined to ensure the safe fi  nal disposal of high-level waste. 
It is estimated to be ready by 2020.

Thermal energy production is the most 
common global electricity production method, while CHP is most advanced in 
areas with high demand for heat, like in 
the Nordic countries and Russia. 
As an energy generation process, 
CHP is flexible in regard to fuels. This means that a CHP process can be applied both to renewable and fossil fuels. The 
specific technologies employed and the 
efficiencies they achieve will vary, but in every situation CHP offers the capability 
to make more efficient use of primary 
energy resources. CHP could also be util -
ised in connection with nuclear power. Resource efficiency driving CH p
Due to increasing scarcity of global natu -
ral resources, resource efficiency – both 
in production and in energy use – will 
be further emphasised in the transi -
tion towards Solar Economy. Because 
traditional fuel combustion will still be 
required for a long time, efficiency is a key tool in reducing the environmental 
burden.
CHP will play an important role 
in enhancing resource efficiency, as it 
substantially increases primary energy efficiency. Almost 90% of the energy in 
CHP can be utilised. The heat generated 
during power production is utilised in district heating or as steam for industrial 
processes. CHP also reduces the environ -
mental burden.Fortum’s CH p production
Fortum has extensive experience in CHP 
production in Finland, Sweden, Russia, 
Poland, the Baltics and the UK. Fortum 
operates 20 CHP plants in Europe and eight mostly gas-fired CHP plants in Rus -
sia. In 2011 the share of CHP plants in Fortum’s total power production was 29% and of total heat production 71%. 
       The company provides district heat 
in almost 90 cities, including Stockholm, Sweden; Espoo, Finland ; Wroclaw, Poland as well as in Russia in Chelyabinsk and Tjumen areas, where it is the leading 
district heating supplier.  A signifi -
cant share of Fortum’s district heat is 
produced in CHP plants. Fortum also 
produces heat and steam for industry in 
CHP plants.
Fortum produces electricity and heat 
from a diverse range of fuels: in Europe from natural gas, coal, oil, biomass, peat and waste-derived fuels, and in Russia 
from natural gas and coal. Combined heat and power’s role in Solar Economy
Combined heat and power (CHP) production is a significant 
technological solution to increase energy and resource efficiency in areas with demand for heat, like in the Nordic countries and russia. In 2011, the share of CHp in f ortum’s total power 
generation was 29% and in heat production 71%.

bio-based chp – even a more 
sophisticated solution
Bioenergy (electricity and heat produced from biofuels and biomass) as a renew -
able energy source and, to a large extent, as a local fuel has an important role in today’s energy system and in the transi -
tion towards Solar Economy. Bioenergy is considered an important tool in mitigat -
ing climate change, because bioenergy is CO
2-neutral when taking into account 
its life cycle. The advantages of bioenergy 
are further improved when used in con -
junction with CHP.  The use of local bio-
energy reduces dependence on imported fuels and supports local economies by 
employing people.
At Fortum, sustainable fuel procure -
ment and fuel supply chain management are emphasised.  In 2011, Fortum com -
piled guidelines and actions to improve 
the traceability and sustainability of 
bioenergy used in energy production. In 
Fortum’s view, all bioenergy should be ecologically, socially and economically 
sustainable when purchased and used for 
energy production. In 2011, Fortum used a total of 6.2 
terawatt-hours (TWh) of biofuels, mostly 
in CHP and heat production. Biofuels are 
used as solid biomass and liquid biofuels in co-combustion with other fuels.

ducer, Fortum brings proven expertise and technologies to the russian heat sector. In November, Fortum commenced the fi  rst phase of the integrated district heating project, Chelyabinsk Heat ring. 
Fortum operates 370 km of district 
heat network in Chelyabinsk. The heat losses in the existing network are high, up 
to 60%, whereas ,e.g., in Espoo, Finland, 
the corresponding fi  gure is 20%. 
The project changes the way heat is 
delivered to homes and businesses across the city. The ring makes it possible to use the most effi  cient heat production plants depending on the heat loads. The instal-lation of metering and regulation allows consumers themselves to regulate heat consumption. When fi  nished, by 2017, the effi  ciency of the heat supply in this city of one million residents in the southern urals area will increase by some 30%. The Case:

Key impacts of chp
CHP is based on the combustion of fuels and resulting in emissions and environ-
mental burden. The most signifi  cant 
environmental impacts of thermal energy production are related to fl  ue-gas 
emissions, emissions to water, and wastes 
and by-products.
Emissions to air
The most signifi  cant environmental impact from fossil fuel combustion in 
CHP is CO
2 emissions and their impact 
on global warming and climate change. Energy production and use are the main 
source of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
effi  ciency increase will generate savings 
of up to Eur 60 million annually. 
In Tyumen, the second largest heat 
market for Fortum russia, the company completed the automated metering system that ensures transparency in heat transfer between the trunk and distribu-tion networks. More than 150 stations have been installed to enable the online 
collection of information about the status 
of the trunk networks.The combustion of fuels results in 
emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO 2), nitro-
gen oxides (NO x) and particle emissions. 
Particles and heavy metals are harmful 
for the environment and also pose a 
health risk. Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides have an impact on acidifi  cation. 
These emissions are reduced by fl  ue gas 
cleaning and are controlled in power plant-specifi  c environmental permits.
In 2011, Fortum continued prepara-
tions for the investments needed to fulfi  l the new emissions requirements 
set by the Industrial Emissions Direc-
tive (IED) from 2016 onwards in the EU countries. The IED tightens the emis-
sions requirements for practically all 
Fortum’s thermal power plants in the EU. Plant-specifi  c feasibility studies and 
cost estimates were carried out during 
2011. A more precise cost effect of the new requirements, however, will become 
clear after the plant-specifi  c permit 
conditions have been defi  ned during the next few years.56 towArDS SmArter eNerGY proDuCtIoN fortum SuStAINABILItY report 2011Fortum has built Finland’s biggest geother-
mal- and bioenergy-based hybrid plant for S-Group’s logistics centre in Sipoo. virtually all the heating and cooling energy needed by the huge logistics centre is produced with renewable energy. It is also Finland’s biggest geothermal site. The hybrid plant utilises geothermal energy to produce the baseload energy for the logistics centre 
for as much of the operating time as pos-
sible. Heat pumps utilise solar energy that has been absorbed in the ground. The increased need for heating during winter is supplemented with wood pellets. Heavy fuel boilers are reserved for peak consump-tion situations only.
The fi  bre optics-based real-time moni-
toring system installed in the geothermal fi  eld is used to acquire research information about the behaviour of the geothermal fi  eld. If the heating needs of the logistic centre were covered with heavy fuel oil, it would generate 6,400 tonnes of CO
2 emis-sions annually. By comparison, the GeoBio hybrid plant reduces emissions by 95%, i.e., about 6,100 tonnes per year. 
The plant was built and is owned by 
Fortum Energiaratkaisut Oy, which was divested in the beginning of 2012. Case:

into geothermal heat and bioenergywaste and waste water 
The waste generated from thermal 
energy production mainly consists of 
various kinds of ash, bottom slag and 
gypsum created as a by-product of the desulphurisation process. In Fortum’s 
European operations, waste and by-
products are utilised and recycled as effi  -ciently as possible. In Russia, ash is stored 
in basins, because there is no demand 
for ash usage, and the wet ash handling makes utilisation more diffi  cult.
The impacts of thermal energy pro-
duction on water systems are mainly caused by the thermal loads of cooling 
waters, the release of solids, and nitrogen, 
phosphorus and heavy metal emissions. CHP is an effective way of reducing the 
thermal load on water systems. This also 
reduces the need for cooling water.

electricity needs to fl  ow over national borders. This requires heavy investments in 
national electricity distribution 
networks as well as cross-border transmission lines.1. market-driven 
system
Investments will be effi  ciently allocated based on 
supply and demand. In the 
long run, renewable energy production will not rely on 
government subsidies – it 
will be fi  nancially sound on its own merit.as an energy industry expert, Fortum 
engages in an active dialogue with au-
thorities and decision-makers about key 
issues in the energy sector. For Fortum’s investments, the starting point is always an economically viable balance between 
increasing demand and emissions 
reduction targets. a strong balance sheet and good profi  tability are important to 
Fortum. They help to ensure that Fortum 
can implement its strategy with fl  exibility, carry out planned investments and seize 
new opportunities when they arise.
Fortum envisions good opportunities 
in the direct utilisation of solar power, 
among other sources of renewable en-
ergy, and believes that it has the potential to be commercially competitive. 
The extensive increase in renewable 
energy, especially intermittent wind and solar energy, will create a major challenge 
for the operation of the present energy 
transmission infrastructure. Fortum owns, operates and develops regional and local electricity networks and supplies electric-
ity to a total of 1.6 million customers in 
Finland, Sweden and Norway. Continuous investments are being made to renew, 
maintain and further improve network 
reliability. In 2011, Eur 289 million was invested in new power lines, isolating

according to the strategy. In research and development, f ortum 
is actively investigating the future Solar economy production 
technologies, such as solar and wave power.
Most of Fortum’s growth investments in 
2011 were implemented by the Russia, 
Heat and Power Divisions. In the Distribu -
tion business area, Fortum is investing 
in further improving the reliability of its 
grid and in the installation of new smart 
electricity meters in Finland .
In 2011, Fortum’s capital expenditures 
and investments in shares totalled EUR 1,482 million (2010: EUR 1,249 million). Investments, excluding acquisitions, were 
EUR 1,408 million (2010: EUR 1,222 mil -
lion), 262 million (2010: 214 million) of 
which was for CO
2-free production. The 
biggest investments were made in Russia, 
EUR 670 million (2010: 599 million), and 
in Sweden, EUR 392 million (2010: 300 million). Investments in renewable energy 
forms were EUR 247 million (2010: 182 
million). These investments were mainly new CHP investments. Furthermore, 
Fortum invested a total of EUR 82 million 
(2010: 91 million) in the environment and safety in 2011. Fortum currently expects its capital 
expenditure in 2012 to be around EUR 
1.6–1.8 billion and in 2013–2014 around 
EUR 1.1–1.4 billion, excluding potential acquisitions. The main reason for the high 
capital expenditures in 2012 is the accel -
eration of Fortum’s Russian investment 
programme. The annual maintenance 
capital expenditure is estimated to be 
about EUR 500–550 million in 2012. 
Fortum pursues growth from 
energy-efficient CH p production 
In January 2011, Fortum finalised the 
acquisition of two Polish power and heat 
companies, Elektrociepłownia Zabrze S.A. 
and Zespół Elektrociepłowni Bytom S.A. from the Polish State. Fortum also inau -
gurated a new combined heat and power plant in Pärnu, Estonia. The plant uses local fuels, like woodchips, wood residues 
from industry and milled peat. The pro -
duction capacity of the new CHP plant is 
24 megawatts (MW) of electricity and 50 
MW of heat. Furthermore, Fortum and the 
municipal energy company Sollentuna 
Energi signed a final agreement accord -
ing to which Sollentuna Energi will par -
ticipate with a 15% share in Fortum’s new waste-fired CHP unit, Brista 2, which is being built in the Stockholm area in Swe -
den. The new unit will be able to process a total of 240,000 tons of household and industrial waste per year. According to 
the plan, Brista 2 will be ready for pro -
duction in 2013 and its capacity will be 
57 MW heat and 20 MW electricity. In June 2011, Fortum decided to 
invest in two new biofuel-fired CHP plants in Järvenpää, Finland, and Jelgava, Latvia. The investments total around 
EUR 160 million and the plants are esti -
mated to start commercial operation in 
2013. The new plants replace oil and gas 
with biofuels.

Fortum is committed to a EUR 2.5-bil -
lion investment programme in Russia, 
with the last new units scheduled for 
commissioning in 2014. Altogether, For -
tum’s extensive investment programme 
consists of eight new units, and it will 
increase OAO Fortum’s power production capacity by approximately 2,400 MW and 
heat production capacity by 662 MW. The 
investment programme is based mainly 
on the use of natural gas. The value of 
the remaining part of the investment programme is estimated to be approxi -
mately EUR 0.9 billion as of January 2012. Fortum is also investing in improving the energy efficiency of the production plants 
and district heating systems.Upon completion of the ongoing 
investment programme, Fortum targets a positive economic value added for the 
Russia Division. According to the rules of the capacity market, the generation capac -
ity built after 2007 under the government capacity supply agreements (CSA – “new capacity”) will receive guaranteed pay -
ments for a period of 10 years. Prices for capacity under CSA are defined to ensure a sufficient return on investments. 
OAO Fortum’s new capacity will bring 
income from new volumes sold and will 
receive considerably higher capacity pay -
ments than the old capacity. However, the 
price differs depending on the age, loca -
tion, type and size of the plant as well as seasonality. The first and fourth quarters have higher old capacity income than the second and third quarters. 
The first three units of Fortum’s 
investment programme in Russia started commercial operation in 2011 in 
Tyumen  , Chelyabinsk and Tobolsk. Also 
the construction of the new power plant 
in Nyagan in North Urals continued. 
Once completed, the plant will have three natural gas-fired units with a 418 
MW production capacity each. The first 
two units, Nyagan 1 and Nyagan 2, will be commissioned in 2012.  improving the availability 
of nuclear power 
In Finland, Fortum is participating in the construction of TVO’s (Teollisuuden 
Voima Oyj) third nuclear power unit 
Olkiluoto 3 (1,600 MW). The power plant is being constructed by TVO, of 
which Fortum holds an about 26% share. 
AREVA-Siemens Consortium, which is constructing Olkiluoto 3 on a fixed-price 
turn-key contract, has informed TVO 
that the unit is scheduled to be ready for commercial electricity production in 
August 2014. 
Moreover, Fortum decided to par -
ticipate in the financing of the bidding and engineering phase of TVO’s fourth 
nuclear unit at Olkiluoto, Finland, with a stake corresponding Fortum’s share in 
TVO. The bidding and engineering phase 
commenced in December 2011. Accord -
ing to the decision-in-principle, made by 
the Finnish Parliament in July 2010, the 
application for a building permit for the Olkiluoto’s fourth unit must be filed latest 
in June 2015. 
Fortum has two fully-owned reactors 
in Loviisa and the company is a co-owner in eight reactors at the Olkiluoto, Oskar -
shamn and Forsmark power plants. Fors -
mark and Oskarshamn nuclear power plants are undergoing capacity upgrades

growing investments in 
renewable energy 
In 2011, Fortum continued to develop its 
existing hydro assets. Fortum’s long-term 
hydropower refurbishment programme 
aims to improve the production, effi  -ciency and safety of hydropower plants. 
The investment programme will increase 
Fortum’s hydropower capacity by about 100 MW by 2020. 
Fortum is also preparing to partici-
pate in the tender processes for hydro-power concessions in France, which are expected to offi  cially start in 2012. In 
the frame of the European directive, 
France is to open up the hydro concession renewal process for competition. The 
French Government is thus putting the 
fi  rst tranche of ten concessions with a 
total capacity of 5,300 MW into a tender 
process in 2012–2015.
In October, Fortum and the French 
DCNS signed a Letter of Intent on 
 co-operation in the fi  eld of wave power 
research and development in France. A joint feasibility study for a wave power 
demonstration project located in France 
was started in 2011.
Fortum and Seabased AB signed an 
agreement in the end of the year on the construction of a joint wave power park in Sotenäs, Sweden. The construction of the park will start in 2012. After completion, the wave power park will be the world’s 
largest full-scale demonstration project 
of this kind. The Swedish Energy Agency has decided to grant investment support 
for the project.
Fortum and the Swedish Skellefteå 
Kraft are also constructing an onshore wind farm in Blaiken, Sweden. The wind 
farm will be constructed in phases and is expected to be completed in 2015. 
investments in electricity 
network and smart metering 
Fortum owns, operates and develops 
regional and local electricity networks and supplies electricity to a total of 1.6 
million customers in Finland, Sweden 
and Norway. The total length of the com-pany’s network is 156,000 km, which is 
almost four times the circumference of 
the earth. Continuous investments are made to renew, maintain and further 
improve network reliability. In 2011, EUR 
289 million was invested in new power 
lines, isolating overhead lines, under-
ground cables and automation of critical parts of the grid, i.e., a step towards a 
smarter grid with fewer and shorter 
outages. The severe storms at the end of 2011, among the strongest in 30 years 
in Finland, damaged Fortum’s network 
and caused power outages for hundreds of thousands of customers, and thus put 
additional focus on a more weather-proof 
network. 
Fortum is building two new biofuel-fi  red 
combined heat and power (CHP) plants in Jelgava, latvia, and in Järvenpää, Finland. The value of the investment is around Eur 160 million and the plants are scheduled to start commercial operation in 2013.
The new Jelgava plant is the fi  rst in its 
scale to use biofuels in latvia and it will replace heat production based on natural 
gas. The plant will reduce the region’s 
CO
2 emissions by approximately 30,000 
tonnes annually. In Jelgava, the biofuels to be used include woodchips from forest and industry. The plant also can utilise waste fuels and peat. The annual produc-tion of the plant will be approximately 230 gigawatt-hours (Gwh) of heat and 110 Gwh 
of electricity.
The new plant in Järvenpää will replace 
current natural gas and heavy fuel oil 
heat production, and the region’s CO
2 
emissions will decrease by 70,000 tonnes annually. The biofuels to be used in the Järvenpää plant are mainly wood chips and by-products of the forest industry, such as sawdust and bark, in addition to some peat. The annual production of the plant will be about 280 Gwh of heat and about 130 Gwh of electricity. Case:

holding in Fingrid as a result of the EU’s 
third energy market package calling for the separation of high-voltage transmis-
sion and power generation. The package 
entered into force in September 2009.
Fortum signed an agreement to sell 
its Estonian subsidiary Fortum Elekter 
to Imatran Seudun Sähkö in December 
2011. In connection with the agree-ment, Fortum also sold its ownership in 
 Imatran Seudun Sähkö Oy. The closing

research and development 
The purpose of research and develop-ment (R&D) is to improve Fortum’s 
competitiveness and to create a founda-
tion for new profi  table business. The long-term aspiration of R&D is to enable 
a sustainable carbon dioxide-free future 
for Fortum. Each new development activity is assessed against the criteria of carbon dioxide emissions reduction and resource effi  ciency. R&D focus areas are 
performance excellence of current opera-
tions, enabling growth and contributing to an emissions-free energy system in the 
long-term. 
Fortum’s main R&D themes cover 
the most advanced technologies in the current energy system and the technolo-
gies and system solutions that will be needed to enable future Solar Economy. 
In 2011, a strong focus in R&D was on 
understanding the potential of various solar technologies. Fortum also teamed 
up with partners in large programmes 
to develop smart grid technologies, sustainable urban solutions, and new 
integrated CHP concepts. Nuclear R&D 
continued to be the largest and most valuable part of Fortum’s R&D portfolio. 
Furthermore, the work in the areas of 
pyrolysis, torrefaction, and the potential of integrating a CHP plant with bioetha-
nol production continued actively. 
The growth and potential of solar 
energy, and the price development of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules in particular, 
were analysed carefully as one of the main strategic topics in Fortum in 2011. The 
conclusion was that solar PV is approach-
ing grid parity from an electricity con-sumer point of view on several markets, 
even without additional subsidies. In addi-
tion, there is still potential for signifi  cant cost reductions in the modules and the 
system. The decision was made to move

at the end of 2011, Fortum and the large-
scale French marine company dCNS started wave power research and development co-operation in France. This offers both parties an opportunity to investigate wave power’s full potential and to utilise their comple-mentary expertise in marine renewable energy. In 2011, Fortum also established a country organisation in France in order to 
participate in the long-term development 
of the renewable energy in France. Fortum has been active in wave energy 
development since 2007, researching both offshore and nearshore technologies in demonstration plants in Sweden and Portu-gal. Thus, studying wave power’s potential is a signifi  cant step in the transition towards  Solar Economy.Case:

In the area of smart grids, Fortum 
participated in successful piloting activities in Finland. At Masala substation, 
Finland, Fortum has developed a highly 
automatised grid that can be considered as a key step towards a self-healing 
grid. Fortum participated in testing the 
electricity grid automation concepts and improving grid reliability. In Mäkkylä, 
Finland, Fortum tested sustainable urban 
living solutions with partners such as ABB, Skanska and KONE. Several other 
studies were also carried out on topics of 
interest to Fortum, including microgrid planning and grid impact of fast charging 
of electric vehicles. 
The pre-study for the Smart Grid 
project in Stockholm Royal Seaport was fi  nalised during the spring. It confi  rmed 
that the various parts of the energy system can be connected, which will 
enable the consumer to participate more 
actively in the electricity market. The pre-study was managed by Fortum in a 
consortia consisting of 13 different part-
ners. The project then proceeded with planning for the next phase of imple-
mentation and tests including partner 
negotiations and fi  nancing. r&d ExpEndiTurE, Eur million

Moreover, activities within Fortum’s 
solid nuclear R&D portfolio progressed 
from development towards implemen-
tation. For example, the use of higher 
burnup nuclear fuel and antimony-free 
pump seal materials at the Loviisa nuclear power plant were developed. 
The Fukushima accident strengthened 
the focus on nuclear safety also within nuclear R&D. After the accident, the con-
tents and priorities of all Fortum nuclear 
R&D programmes were reviewed.
Fortum’s R&D expenditure in 2011 
was EUR 38 million (2010: 30 million) or 0.6% of sales (2010: 0.5%) and 1.1% of total expenses (2010: 0.8%).  
Fortum supports organisations and com-
munities working for the common good in the countries where it operates. In 2011, Fortum’s support for society totalled approximately Eur 4.6 million. 
One example of Fortum’s support for 
society is the lightning projects that aim to light up dark areas in cities in Finland and Sweden. The areas are chosen by public 
vote and are usually places people have 
deemed to be unsafe due to insuffi  cient lighting. Fortum provides the planning and construction of the lighting, and the cities are responsible for maintaining and servic-ing the infrastructure.  In 2011, the concept was developed 
further in Stockholm. The “ljusruset” campaign, involving the City of Stockholm and the Swedish athletic association, is an exercise contest involving three local jog-ging circuits competing against each other. The aim of the campaign is to showcase Fortum’s expertise in energy effi  ciency and to link it to the residents’ well-being 
through exercise and safety. The campaign 
won gold in the “Green Event” category in the European Best Event award and silver in the “Pr” category in the Eurobest award.Case:

responsible supply 
chain management
Fortum wants to conduct business with viable companies that act responsibly 
and comply with Fortum Code of Con -
duct and Supplier Code of Conduct. 
While Fortum Code of Conduct provides 
the basis for ethical business conduct, 
Fortum Supplier Code of Conduct sets 
the basic sustainability requirements 
on what is expected from suppliers of services and goods. It is based on the ten 
principles of the United Nations Global 
Compact and is divided into four sec -
tions: business practices, human rights, 
labour standards and the environment. 
Monitoring of suppliers that was started with revised methodology in 2011 will help Fortum to identify potential risk suppliers and thus recognise and focus 
the need for further actions.
responsible fuel purchasing
Fortum purchases fuels from interna -
tional and local suppliers. In 2011, fuel purchases represented 35% of the total 
purchasing volume out of which roughly half originated from risk countries. 
From the total annual purchasing vol -
ume (EUR 2.6 billion) fuels accounted for 
about EUR 900 million (2010: 960), with 
fossil fuels accounting for EUR 655 mil -
lion and biofuels EUR 175 million. 
Sustainability of fuel procurement 
and especially sourcing of fossil fuels and 
biomass has become a topic of concern. Industry wide dialogue is required to 
address issues systematically. Fortum 
has been actively participating in indus -
try and stakeholder dialogues on respon -
sible fuel sourcing, read more on page 70.uranium
The fuel assemblies of the existing power plant units in Loviisa are both Russian 
and British. The uranium used in the 
assemblies of both manufacturers origi -
nates from Russia. 
The zirconium mate -
rial manufacturing plant and the plant 
responsible for manufacturing uranium 
oxide pellets and fuel assemblies, are certified in accordance with the ISO 
14001 environmental management 
standard.Fortum carries out regular reviews 
of the quality, environmental and 
health and safety management systems 
of its nuclear fuel suppliers. Fortum also controls regularly the manufacture of nuclear fuel assemblies. In 2011, 
Fortum’s nuclear and sustainability 
experts visited both the nuclear fuel assembly and the conversion unit in 
Russia. In summer 2012, a similar visit 
is scheduled to take place in one of the uranium mines operated by Fortum’s 
Russian supplier.
 Fuels and procurement
Fortum is a significant purchaser of goods and services, the annual purchasing volume 
being approximately eur 2–3 billion depending on the investment volume. Beyond investments, a significant part of the purchasing volume is related to purchasing of fuels, 
while the rest comes from purchasing of various goods and services. Sustainability is an 
integral part of f ortum’s supply chain management. our goods and service providers as 
well as contractors play an important role in our efforts towards sustainability. 
In 2011, Fortum’s 130 purchasing persons and 
project managers in Finland, the Baltic countries, Poland and Sweden were trained to evaluate 
suppliers based on sustainability criteria.130PErSONS T raINEd TO E valua TE

Natural gas used in Fortum’s operations 
in 2011  in Russia, the Baltic countries, 
Poland and Finland originated from Russia. In Russia gas is purchased from 
several suppliers. In the UK, Fortum 
purchases natural gas from the national supplier and it originates mostly from 
the UK and Norwegian gas fields in the 
North Sea.
All the natural gas consumed in 
Finland is imported from the Western-Siberian natural gas fields of Yamburg and Urengoy in Russia, some 3,300 km 
from the Finnish-Russian border. The 
Western-Siberian gas fields are the rich -
est in the world, and the natural gas 
obtained is very pure.
coal
In 2011, the majority (88%) of the coal used by Fortum in Finland and Sweden 
originated from Russia, but there were also small purchases from Columbia.   
Coal used in Polish power plants originated from Poland and Russia, and Fortum’s Russian power plants used coal from Russia and Kazakhstan. 
In Russia coal is transported in open 
cars by railway from a coal strip mine 
to a power plant. Coal to other Fortum’s 
operating countries is transported by sea.
The coal Fortum uses has specific 
quality requirements and is usually pur -
chased as a blend. The country of origin is always known but when coal is pur -
chased as a blend the exact share of each 
mine is not known. In case of other than blend deliveries, the origin is known at 
the mine level. In early 2012, Fortum 
decided to join Bettercoal initiative to promote the principles of  sustainable 
development in coal mining, read more on page 71.
biofuels
In 2011, the majority (70%) of the biofuels used consisted of wood pellets, wood 
chips and industrial wood residues, and 
they originated mainly from Sweden, Finland and Germany. Other types of 
biofuels were also acquired for example 
from the United States, Spain and Malay -
sia. Fortum recognises the challenges 
related to the origin of biofuels and thus 
cannot be absolutely confident about the country of origin. Fortum’s position and actions for the sustainable utilisation of 
bioenergy approved in late 2011 will con -
tribute to improved traceability.
In Finland, biomasses consumed 
were forest chips, by-products from for -
est industry, black liquor, recycled wood from industry and construction and 
a minor amount of wood pellets, reed canary grass and biogas. Additionally, solid refined recovered waste fuel was 
used in one power plant. The biofuels 
used originate mainly from Finland, only minor volumes of Russian wood were 
consumed. Aim is to increase the use of 
solid biofuels originating from certified sources in the coming years and also to 
report the share of this biofuel.Fuel country of origin

The sustainable production and use 
of bioenergy is an increasingly topical 
issue worldwide. The European Union 
has defined the sustainability criteria 
for biofuels and  bioliquids in transport 
and is considering enlarging the scope 
of criteria into solid biomass in energy 
production.
Bioenergy is an important energy 
source for Fortum. In 2011, Fortum 
compiled position and actions for the 
sustainable utilisation of bioenergy 
in electricity and heat production. The position and actions contribute to 
improved traceability of biomass fuels 
and responsible management of fuel purchases. Actions include, for example, 
the pre-selection and audit of suppliers, 
certification of the wood biomass chain, risk analyses and participation in inter -national initiatives on sustainable bioen -
ergy. Position and actions were approved in December 2011 and their implementa -
tion will start in 2012.

The current system of variable requirements of certification schemes and national/local sustainability schemes for biomass is confusing from the biomass supplier, user and investor point of view.

standards for goods suppliers and better 
procedures in purchasing. As part of the 
collaboration, Fortum reports its annual targets to WWF and engages in an active 
dialogue. 
In order to successfully reach the tar-
get, buyers, suppliers and subcontractors need to have an adequate knowledge and 
understanding of what sustainable forest management means. In 2011, Fortum 
Värme organised training on the Forest 
Stewardship Council (FSC) require-ments and certifi  cation to enhance the 
knowledge of fuel purchasing personnel. 
Fortum Värme uses more than 350,000 tonnes of wood chips and 300,000 tonnes of pellets at its plants in Sweden every 
year. The wood used originates from the 
Baltic countries, Russia, Sweden, Fin-land, North America and South Europe. 
In 2011, Fortum Värme analysed the pos-
sibility of joining the FSC and decided to apply for membership starting in 2012. 
Fortum Värme has been a member of 
the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) since 2005. RSPO is a collabora-
tive body of palm oil producers, consum-
ers and non-governmental organisations. The organisation has developed criteria 
for sustainable palm oil production 
and the use of palm oil. RSPO organises annual meetings for its members to 
exchange views and experiences among 
various stakeholders; Fortum representa-tives participate in these meetings. In 
2011, Fortum used about 137,750 cubic 
meters of fractions that are residues of palm or soy oil production, and some res-idues of oil from the chemical industry 
and paper industry. Fortum has special 
requirements for all residual products and works actively with traceability. 
The bio oils used by Fortum come from 
Malaysia, Indonesia, the United States, Brazil and Europe. All palm oil residual s 
come from RSPO member companies. 
Bettercoal is an independent, non-profi  t 
organisation that works to advance the continuous improvement of corporate responsibility in the coal supply chain. 
Coal is mined by opencast or under-
ground mining. Surface mining can be more challenging in terms of environmen-tal protection, whereas working conditions in the underground mines can create occu-
pational health and safety concerns. 
The basis of the work of Bettercoal 
initiative is the Bettercoal Code that will 
build upon existing standards applied to mining, setting out the social, environ-Case:

mental and ethical standards that coal 
mining companies are expected to comply with. The compliance will be assured by suppliers’ self-assessments and site-assessments performed by independent third party assessors. Over time Bettercoal also expects to develop appropriate tools, training and capacity building activities to further support suppliers. Bettercoal will 
produce a public annual report of activity 
including performance data and qualitative information such as good practices from the mines and special topics relating to emerging issues that Bettercoal will strive to address. 
Bettercoal is working closely with 
its stakeholders and has established an independent Stakeholder advisory Group to provide advice and guidance on a variety of topics including the draft Bet-tercoal Code and the public consultation process that will be launched later in 2012. The group is made up of experts from civil society (including non-governmental organisations and academic experts),  international unions, and the private sector

surplus electricity to the grid. 1. Customers adjusting 
consumption
Customers can use real-time 
consumption and market information to adjust their 
own consumption from peak 
hour prices to hours when the price is lower. Software 
applications support 
customers in optimising their consumption. Fortum is installing smart meters for 
all its customers to offer better control of electricity usage. The advantage of smart meters is that customers can now see their actual household electricity consumption data via the internet. Fortum has also launched in-home displays – in Sweden in 2010 and in Finland in 2011 – to enable customers 
to track their own consumption in real 
time. 
In addition, Fortum engages in several 
smart grid-related r&d and demon-stration projects. In Finland, Fortum has participated in successful piloting activities on automation concepts to improve grid reliability and sustainable urban living solutions with partners such as aBB, Skanska and kONE. In Sweden, Fortum is contributing to the development of smart grids and smart heating and cooling solutions for the

and supplies electricity to a total of 1.6 
million customers in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The total length of the company’s 
network is 156,000 km, which is almost 
four times the circumference of the earth. Continuous investments are made to 
renew, maintain and further improve net -
work reliability. In 2011, EUR 289 million 
was invested in new power lines, isolating 
overhead lines, underground cables and 
automation of critical parts of the grid, i.e., a step towards a smarter grid with fewer 
and shorter outages. 
The severe storms at the end of 2011, 
and one of the strongest in 30 years in Finland, damaged Fortum’s network and 
caused power outages for many custom -
ers, and thus put additional focus on a 
more weather-proof network. The reliabil -

regularly during the year. Monitoring is done by general customer satisfaction sur -
veys and process specific measurements. 
Surveys are standardized and executed in 
all countries where Fortum has customers 
enabling benchmarking between coun -
tries and business areas. Large amount of 
customer transactions enables continu -
ous monitoring of satisfaction in main 
customer processes. Fortum also regularly 
tests development ideas by discussing 
them at customer advisory councils in Finland and at one-off customer meetings in other countries.climate-benign products

Since 2009, Fortum has only offered CO 2-
free electricity for its household customers 
in Finland and Sweden. More and more 
private customers and companies are demanding that the electricity they buy 
comes with a guarantee of origin, i.e., 
information about how the electricity is produced. All electricity sold by Fortum is 
guaranteed by the European Guarantee of

a result, the average interruption duration per customer increased by 5-fold. Fortum 
will increase investments in a more 
weather-proof network and has set a tar-get to cut the number of power outages in 
half. The aim is also to double the number 
of customers currently within the scope of weather-proof distribution by 2020. 
installation of smart meters to 
electricity distribution customers 
Smart meters offer better control of elec-
tricity usage and thus are a step towards 
smarter energy consumption. In Finland, 
approximately 580,000 customers will receive new meters before the end of 
2013. In 2011, the rollout of smart meter-
ing to network customers in Finland proceeded according to plan; by the end 
of 2011, 160,000 customers had received 
meters. The new Finnish legislation on hourly meter reading will become effec-
tive on 1 January 2014. In Sweden, bring-
ing smart metering to customers was completed in 2009. The installation of 
new meters in Norway will begin in 2013; 
altogether 100,000 customers in Fortum’s network area will be connected to the 
system by 2015. The regulation on hourly 
meter reading in Norway will come into effect on 1 January 2017. 
The advantage of smart meters is that 
a large number of customers can now see 
their actual monthly household electricity consumption data via the internet. The 
benefi  ts of the new system also include 
invoicing based on actual electricity con-
sumption, better control over electricity usage and a platform for new services.
Towards smarter grids 
An increased share of renewable energy, distributed energy systems and demands 
for energy effi  ciency are all part of the 
future society and put new demands on the grid. Smart meters and smart grids 
will change the electricity market in the 
years ahead. Smart grids enable customers to produce some of the electcity they use, 
e.g., through their own solar panels, and to 
sell their excess electricity to the grid. 
Fortum is actively developing the solu-
tions for sustainable urban living. For-
tum’s focus in building the future smart 
grid has especially been on electricity grid development, distributed energy systems 
and smart-home solutions. Read more on 
Fortum’s smart grid related research and development activities on page 66.
Energy storage solutions are being 
developed in the Fortum Flexible Energy research project. One example of such 
solutions is the integration of the electric 
vehicle charging infrastructure into the energy system to enable the use of car 
batteries as energy storage units. Another 
storage solution is to store heat or cold in large reservoirs until it is needed. It is 
therefore possible to heat a city on a cold 
winter day using the heat produced on a sunny summer day. The storm on 26 december 2011, one of 
the strongest in 30 years in Finland, and the smaller storm on the following day caused major damage to Fortum’s electricity distri-bution grid in Finland. Fortum had prepared for the storm by quadrupling the number of service technicians on duty. However, the conditions exceeded the forecasts. at the worst point, more than 190,000 Fortum 
customers in Finland were simultaneously 
without electricity. In addition to Finland, the storms caused some power outages and damage also in Sweden.
Since the storm, Fortum has carefully 
analysed its operations and has mapped the areas requiring improvement. For example, the implementation of a text messaging service and developments in the IT systems were identifi  ed as essential. For-tum is also setting a long-term target to cut the number of power outages in half and to double the number of customers cur-rently within the scope of weather-proof distribution. This will be done by accelerat-ing underground cabling and moving areal lines from the forest to the roadside. The weather reliability of the distribution network also can be improved by better management of adjacent forests and with grid automation.

ing of electric vehicles by designing the charging station network and payment 
system. Fortum has more than 100 public charging stations in Scandinavia. In 2011, 
the company continued the development 
of solutions for electric vehicles and introduced a new turnkey concept that provides recharging services of electric 
vehicles for companies and municipalities 
in Finland, Sweden and Norway. Fortum’s concept takes care of the whole process: 
installation of the charging poles, electric -
ity, maintenance and outage service.  serving heat customers
Fortum’s heat customers are businesses, 
municipal and private consumers. The 
company has about 1,400 km of district 
heat network in Finland,  about 2,400 km in Sweden, about 860 km in Poland, 
about 280 km in the Baltic countries and 
about  480 km in Russia. The reliability 
of the district heat networks is being 
improved by repairing anomalies found 
in conjunction with scheduled mainte -
nance and by investing in new capacity 
when needed. When carrying out repairs 
that may cause interruptions, the aim is to schedule them outside the heat -
ing season. All of Fortum’s district heat customers in Finland have been within the sphere of the smart meters since the 
beginning of 2010. With smart meters, 
the meter data is received in real time and the monitoring of heat consumption 
is more efficient. 
In the autumn 2011, Fortum 
launched new products for district heat -
ing customers in Sweden and Finland; customers can now choose between dif -
ferent types of products instead of only one. Fortum provides assistance with 
the choice and also offers energy advice to help customers improve their energy 
efficiency. The company has also devel -
oped a Fortum climate neutral product 
for its Finnish and Swedish district 
heating customers. The idea behind the 
Fortum climate neutral product is to offset the greenhouse gas emissions of 
district heating, in the same way that airline companies offer their customers 
an opportunity to offset the greenhouse 
gas emissions of aviation. 
Fortum is also actively developing its 
heating services for customers in Russia by modernising the Chelyabinsk and Tyu -
men heating systems. In November 2011, 
Fortum commenced operations of stage 
one of the ambitious district heating proj -
ect, the Chelyabinsk Heat Ring. The proj -
ect will increase the efficiency of the heat supply in this city of one million residents 
in the southern Urals area by some 30%. The project also changes the way heat is 
delivered to homes and businesses across 
the city; the heat will be supplied via an encircling pipeline rather than a radial 
one. Fortum also installed an automated 
metering system in Tyumen to improve the monitoring of the trunk and district 
heat networks. 
smart heating and 
cooling solutions
Fortum is the owner and operator of the 
biggest district cooling network in the 
world. In Stockholm the district cooling 
network supplies more than 400 business customers with around 440 gigawatt-hours 
(GWh) of cooling energy. Fortum has an 
installed capacity of 300 megawatts (MW), and all of its cooling is CO
2-free. Most of the 
cooling is generated by free cooling from 
the sea waters around Stockholm. 
Fortum is also the first utility in 
Finland to develop cooling solutions for industry. For example, the new, eco-friendly server centres and their cooling solutions are examples of smart cooling 
solutions; heat generated by the servers is utilised in district heating. In the new 
solution, the consumption of fossil fuels 
can be reduced by an amount equal to about 15,000 tonnes of CO
2 emissions per 
year. Local environmental impacts are 
also reduced with the decreased NO x, SO 2 
and particle emissions. The solution will completely eliminate the adverse effects 
of the server centres’ waste heat previ -
ously released into the environment. fortum S uStAINABILI tY report 2011 eNGAGING w ItH peop Le 77   personnel – promoting employee well-being
Fortum’s goal is to be a preferred 
employer that engages competent employ -
ees at all levels. In 2011, an average of 11,010 employees (2010: 11,156) worked at Fortum. The biggest number of employees 
was in Russia, 4,432 employees on aver -
age. Subcontractor employees worked at 
Fortum sites for a total of approximately 
1,769,000 days during the year. Some 
1,230 (2010: 1,052) employees joined For -
tum in 2011.  
leading p erformance and 
growth supports an open and 
engaging work environment
Fortum believes that performance and growth can be improved by having an open 
and engaging work environment, where all 
employees feel empowered and willing to take responsibility. In 2011, Fortum contin -
ued the Leading Performance and Growth (LPG) initiative, which aims to improve the company’s performance and growth 
by increasing employees’ involvement in 
implementing the strategy, by developing business planning and by strengthening leadership and organisational culture. During 2011, the LPG initiative focused on increasing the understanding of Fortum’s key behaviours: challenge, co-create, coach 
and celebrate. Events were organised 
through out the company to reflect on what the key behaviours mean to us in 
our daily work. In Russia, more than 
65 workshops were conducted covering over 3,000 employees. In the workshops, 
employees had the opportunity to discuss 
key behaviours and their involvement in the strategy. Fortum employees also had 
the opportunity to discuss the initiative 
with senior management at the Fortum Dialogue personnel events.
A development programme called 
Leadership Impact, targeting all Fortum   
managers, was launched in 2011. It provides leaders with an opportunity to deepen the understanding and skills that 
are needed to support and drive the LPG 
initiative. In 2011, over 200 top-level man -
agers started the programme, and it will 
continue in 2012.
 The key behaviours were incorporated 
in the business planning process more widely in 2011 by creating more oppor -
tunities for challenging and co-creation between the units and teams. In addi -
tion, the work has begun to integrate the content and findings of the LPG initiative 
in existing processes, practices and tools – for example in recruitment, onboarding 
and employee development processes.
sensor survey measures 
the implementation of the 
strategy and key behaviours
At the beginning of 2011, a team develop -
ment tool called Sensor was introduced 
at Fortum. Sensor includes a survey 
conducted twice a year to help the teams recognise and discuss their own develop -
ment areas. During the second Sensor round, 
4,227 Fortum employees gave feedback 
to their team by answering the Sensor 
on-line questions. The results indicate improvement in how coaching and chal -
lenging are used to improve performance as well as how success is celebrated in different teams. 
The Fortum-wide employee survey – 
Fortum Sound – focusing on measuring employee engagement was last conducted 
in 2009. During 2010–2011, Fortum has 
prioritised team development through Sensor. The next Fortum Sound survey 
will be conducted in autumn 2012. fortum believes that good leadership is fundamental to 
employee well-being, commitment and performance, and 
that it is essential in supporting the strategic goals of the company. At the year-end 2011, approximately 10,800 
employees worked at f ortum.

programme, Fortum conducted a research 
and conceptualisation project, Fortum Core, in 2010–2011 in cooperation with aalto university. 
The purpose of Fortum Core is to pro-
vide a control room working environment that supports the operators’ well-being, situation awareness and is overall inspiring, 
hence leading to operational excellence, the 
highest profi  tability and a longer lifetime of the power plant. The control room is seen as the human core of a power plant.
The concept is based on research done 
with operators of three control rooms in three power plants in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. Studies have shown that people who enjoy their work environment are usually more productive. The project has resulted in a user’s manual and concrete guides on how to plan a new control room when build-ing a power plant or how to improve existing ones.The Fortum Core control room is a 
combination of different zones for different activities. These activities are part of the daily routines of all people involved in the use of the control room. In addition to the operators’ main working point, the Fortum Core control room has, for example, an area for eating, an area for activating tasks and an area that visitors can access without 
disturbing the operators.
The Core concept will be used within 
the Heat division´s large combined heat 
and power (CHP) investment programme and parts of the concept will be used in the existing power plants. under the umbrella of the Core project, there are also other initiatives that promote the well-being, motivation and performance of personnel working at power plants. Case:

I think that when it comes to all our key 
behaviours combined, they all point to a 
single point: to promote togetherness. we 
need to work across borders – borders be-
tween countries, over units as well as in our 
own offi  ce buildings. Together we are a strong 
organisation, a real melting pot of amazing 
ideas for the future.competent personnel a 
prerequisite for success
Fortum aims to create attractive career 
and development opportunities for indi-
viduals to continuously grow their profes-
sional skills and know-how. Personnel development is supported through annual 
performance and development reviews in 
which all Fortum employees are in scope, personnel training and internal job rota-
tion. 
During the fi  rst half of 2011, Fortum 
conducted two different types of leader-ship training programmes, Fortum 
Manager and Fortum Expert. The For-tum Manager training programme is 
designed for all supervisors in need of 
basic skills related to daily management. The Fortum Expert programme is tai-
lored to the experts’ needs in managerial, 
communication and collaboration skills. In addition to Finland and Sweden, For-
tum Master courses, aimed for all For-
tum’s managers, were organised also in the Baltic countries and Poland. In 2011, 
a total of 347 participants attended in 
the courses, and the number of Fortum Master training days totalled 38.
Fortum Forerunner is a trainee 
programme meant for recent university graduates. During the 18-month-long 
programme, trainees have the opportu-
nity to work at variable assignments in different business environments and to 
get acquainted with Fortum’s operations 
and the energy industry. The current trainee programme started in January land. Prevention was also the focus of all the occupational health care activities in 
Sweden. 
Fortum covers all Swedish, Norwegian, 
Polish and German employees’ occupa-tional health care as required by law. In 
Russia, employees are within the sphere of a medical expenses insurance plan and can 
use private medical services. Also each pro-
duction plant in Russia has a healthcare station with nursing-level fi  rst-aid services.
Fortum’s employees in Finland have 
the option to join the Enerkemi insurance 2011, and the trainees are from Finland, Sweden, Russia, Poland and Latvia.
Employer image developed 
continuously
A strong employer image is extremely 
important for attracting new and retain-
ing current employees. In 2011, Fortum 
was ranked among the top ten ideal employers in Finland. Among technical 
students, Fortum ranked the eighth most 
ideal employer in Finland (2010: 6th) and 26th in Sweden (2010: 34th).
 An important activity for enhanc-
ing employer image internally and externally is the Fortum Ambassador Network. Fortum Ambassadors work at, 
for example, fairs, events and seminars 
to enhance Fortum’s positive employer image and to give students concrete 
examples of different career opportuni-
ties at Fortum. The Fortum Ambassador Network includes 130 employees from 
different divisions and professions in 
Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Poland.
occupational health and 
safety focus on prevention
Fortum’s target is to ensure a safe work-
place for employees and service provid-
ers. Fortum continuously invests in the 
well-being and safety of its employees and contractors at its sites. 
In 2011, an average of 2,700 (2010: 
2,700) employees in Finland were within 
the sphere of Fortum’s occupational health care. About 80% (2010: 75%) of them 
used the company’s own occupational 
health care services and about 20% (2010: 
25%) used contracted health clinics. The total costs of Fortum’s own occupational 
health care in Finland were about EUR 
1.2 million (2010: 1.1 million). The occu-
pational health care costs per person, 
calculated from the share paid by Fortum, 
were EUR 560 (2010: 501) in Finland, and EUR 92 (2010: 99) in Sweden. Preventive 
activities accounted for 39% (2010: 36%) 
of occupational health care visits in Fin-80 eNGAGING wItH peopLe fortum SuStAINABILItY report 2011fund. The fund offers benefi  ts in accor-
dance with the Finnish Health Insurance 
Act and additional benefi  ts in accordance 
with its own regulations. Over 90% of Fortum’s Finnish employees participate 
in the fund. Other countries do not have 
a similar practice in place.
ForcarE programme 
promotes well-being
ForCARE, Fortum’s well-being model, 
is a common denominator for all the 
activities that Fortum does to promote 
the well-being of its employees. The programme goals are to promote safety, 
support employees’ capacity to work 
throughout their career and contribute to the functionality of work communities 
at Fortum. Promoting well-being benefi  ts 
all parties: employees, the employer and the surrounding society.
The ForCARE programme started 
in Finland in 2010 and was rolled out to Sweden and Norway in 2011. The aim 
is to implement it in all countries of 
operation. It will be customised accord-ing to each country’s legislation in col-
laboration with local occupational health 
organisations, the HR department and management. 
In Finland, Fortum launched a 
three-year, work well-being programme with Varma Mutual Pension Insurance 
Company. During 2011, focus areas of the 
programme were mapped by interview-ing supervisors as well as other person-
nel. These include aging, challenges of shift work, including nutrition, sleep 
and recovery, as well as the challenges of 
mobile work. 
preventive occupational health 
care adds to work years 
Fortum encourages employees to remain 
in the working world. In 2011, a total of 
151 employees retired from Fortum. The 
fi  gure includes age-related, early and  disability retirement. In 2011, Fortum 
had 773 (2010: 758) employees over the 
age of 60.
proactive safety measures
In Fortum’s Power Division, the posi-tive trend in the development of safety 
indicators came to a halt in 2010 and the 
goals for safe operations were not met. The Division started to tackle the nega-
tive trend in spring 2010 by organising 
team discussions at every workplace 
in order to get ideas for safety develop-
ment at everyone’s own workplace. In 2011, Power Division launched a change 
programme called “365 safe days”. 
Safety development is the responsibility of all employees and the programme 
enjoyed the full support of the Division’s 
management team right from the start. One of the major tools for change has 
been training. A safety refreshment 
training focusing on safe behaviour and targetting the whole Power Divi-
sion’s personnel was started. Feedback 
from the organisation has been good.

Fortum as a company offers me diverse opportunities; 
at Fortum I can exploit my knowledge and experience 
to its full extent. The year 2011 was remarkable for 
me: we implemented an environmental manage-
ment system at OAO Fortum and passed the fi  rst 
phase of certifi  cation for ISO 14001 in December. 
The way I see it, the certifi  cation opens the pos-sibility for positive change for Fortum personnel in 
russia: people will learn to look at and manage 
all operations through the prism of sustain-
ability. This same approach applies to safety. 
The voice of our employees is extremely 
important when accomplishing our 
development projects.fortum SuStAINABILItY report 2011 eNGAGING wItH peopLe 81   Examples of the division’s own incidents 
were regarded useful, awareness increas-
ing and applicable for own work. The 
training also encouraged people to think about safety at home and in their free-
time. The training will continue in 2012.  
In addition to training, the emphasis was on implementing the agreed measures 
and procedures. 
As a whole, 
2011 turned out to be a 
very good safety year for the division. Almost all the environmental, health and 
safety (EHS) targets included in the Power Division’s business plan for 2011 were 
achieved. The injury frequency for own 
employees was the best ever at the yearly level (LWIF 0.9) and as a three-year rolling 
average. There were no licence non-con-
formities, INES-rated (the International Nuclear Event Scale) nuclear safety 
incidents or market conduct incidents. 
The total number of fi  res, leaks and other environmental incidents in the Power 
Division was three; the target was to stay 
below ten. However, the contractor injury frequency was clearly above the target, 
and in 2012 it will be one of the focus 
areas in the Power Division. 
Fortum’s 
Heat Division introduced 
a new, proactive safety index measure-
ment covering safety walks by managers, 
safety inspections, the use of protective equipment and work permit manage-
ment in Sweden. In Finland, the division developed a common safety induction 
tool, carried out a systematic assessment of safety management at power plants, 
established an expert network to drive an 
aligned approach to safety improvements and started behavioural-based safety 
training at the Joensuu combined heat 
and power (CHP) plant. 
In Poland, one of the major activities 
was the integration of the Zabrze and 
Bytom CHP plants. A comprehensive 
integration plan was defi  ned with the main actions focusing on safety training, 
reporting and investigation, personal 
protective equipment, contractor safety, management safety walks and high-risk 
work procedures. The performance of 
the plants signifi  cantly improved: the number of lost work days dropped from 144 in 2010 to 12 in 2011. Fortum’s target 
is to improve the overall environmental, 
health and safety management of Zabrze and Bytom and to certify the operations 
in accordance with the ISO 14001 envi-
ronmental management system and the 
OHSAS 18001 health and safety manage-
ment system by 2013. 
In the Baltic coun-
tries, the Heat Division focused on the 
safe operation of the new units, safety at 
construction sites and development of the EHS management process. 
In the Electricity Solutions and Dis-
tribution Division, the main focus was on improving contractor safety. An e-learn-

28 companies. In addition, preparations 
for OHSAS 18001 certifi  cation, effective communication via the intranet and 
safety boards were a focus. Elimination 
of the asbestos risk is one of the goals of the EHS action plan in Russia. About 340 
tonnes of asbestos were removed dur-
ing the year, and improvements in the procedures for handling and removing 
asbestos were implemented. An external 
assessment of asbestos handling was car-ried out in 2011. 
Fortum’s combined heat and power (CHP) 
plant in Grangemouth, Scotland, has had no work-related accidents for 10 years, i.e., since the beginning of its commercial use. Grangemouth is the workplace of 23 Fortum employees. 
In addition, the power plant’s availabil-
ity is high: 98.6% on average. The power plant provides Ineos (former BP) with 
approximately half of its yearly demand 
for steam.  
For Grangemouth’s customers, reli-
ability and high availability are key. The close partnership with Ineos in near-miss reporting, effective use of risk assessment, continuous development of environment as well as health and safety processes and practices are behind the good per-formance. risk assessments are usually made together with the client in order to 
maintain high availability at all times. Case:
Grangemouth CHP plant – 
a history of zero accidents
In 2011, Grangemouth’s personnel 
received Fortum’s own Safety award 
for their safe and reliable operations. Fortum’s Safety award is granted yearly to one person and one team, who have showed commitment to safety and contributed to developing a safer work environment at Fortum. The team in Grangemouth has set up several practices 
to prevent accidents: work permits, 
strict requirements for wearing safety equipment and striving towards a non-accusatory work environment, among other things. 
Grangemouth’s good performance 
has been noticed in the united kingdom as well. Since 2006, it has received several awards from the royal Society for the Prevention of accidents.

The most important target groups for 
Fortum’s annual reporting include share -
holders, investors, analysts, decision mak -
ers and the media. Other stakeholders, such as employees, customers, suppliers 
and non-governmental organisations, are 
also regarded as important target groups. Fortum’s intention with this approach of 
selected key themes and a separate GRI

This year Fortum’s Annual Report con -
sists of two parts: the Financials and the 
Sustainability Report. The theme for 
reporting is “Towards Solar Economy”. 
Fortum’s long-term aspiration is to 
be a carbon dioxide-free power and heat company. In recent years, Fortum has deepened its understanding of the future 
energy system – Solar Economy –  and 
outlined the roadmap towards it. Fortum’s Solar Economy concept encompasses not 
only how energy is produced, but also how 
it is used more smartly and the energy system required to enable Solar Economy. 
This report reflects Fortum’s activities 
in 2011 and includes some information from January–February 2012. The Sus -
tainability Report 2010 was published in April 2011 and the 2012 report will be published in April 2013.  
The report structure is divided into 
four sections. The first part of the report describes Fortum as a company and 
provides key information in terms of 
production capacity, customers, person -
nel, certified management systems and 
carbon-dioxide emissions. The Group’s 
business structure by division and a sum -
mary of the key achievements in 2011 are 
also presented. The second part focuses on 
Fortum’s strategy and sustainability’s core role in it, as well as on market develop -
ment. The key themes of Fortum’s sustain -ability approach supporting our vision of the future Solar Economy are discussed in 
the third part of the report. The standard disclosures of the Global Reporting Initia -
tive (GRI) Guidelines are presented in the 
fourth section of the report in order to 
give a better view of GRI compliance.
Contact details for questions and addi -
tional information regarding the Sustain -
ability Report 2011 are presented on the back cover of the report.
report scope and boundary
Defining report content (3.5) 
In 2010, Fortum carried out an assessment of the most significant sustainability 
issues for the company and its stakehold -
ers. As part of the assessment, a compre -
hensive stakeholder analysis was also conducted. In 2011, Fortum introduced 
a new method to measure stakeholder expectations in relation to the reputation 
of the company – the One Fortum survey. 
Read more about the One Fortum survey on page s 94–95 , Stakeholder engagement.
Based on the materiality assessment, 
the One Fortum Survey and Fortum’s vision of the future Solar Economy, the 
following themes were chosen as key top -
ics for Fortum’s sustainability reporting: Energy production – the roles of hydro -
power, nuclear power and combined heat and power (CHP) in the Solar Economy , 
Investments and Research and Develop -includes the parent company Fortum Cor -
poration and all the companies in which 
Fortum Corporation has the power to gov -
ern the financial and operating policies 
and in which it generally holds, directly 
or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting 
rights. Possible deviations to this principle are reported in conjunction with informa -
tion applying different limitations.
The reporting of management prac -
tices does not fully cover Fortum’s minor -
ity ownerships, and thus the defining of the scope of reporting is not fully com -
pliant with the GRI Boundary Protocol. 
According to GRI Boundary Protocol, enti -
ties with 50% ownership or less and with significant impacts should be included in 
the management approach disclosures. In Fortum’s case, management practices 
of the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant (26% 
ownership) and Kemijoki Oy ( 18% owner -
ship in equity capital, 64% ownership in 
hydro power shares) in Finland, together 
with the Forsmark (26% ownership) and Oskarshamn (46% ownership)  nuclear 
power plants in Sweden, are excluded 
from the reporting. 
 Information from previous years is 
presented as pro forma information, i.e., presented on the basis of the organisa -
tion and the functions of each year; the 
impacts of ownership changes in produc -
tion facilities, for example, have not been updated afterwards in the previous key indicators. fortum S uStAINABILIt Y report 2011  GrI CoNteNt INDeX 91   New and acquired capacity
Capacity and assets acquired during the 
year are included in the reporting start-
ing from the date of possession. The same 
applies to the new capacity built and the new capacity and assets commissioned 
during the year.
In January 2011, Fortum fi  nalised 
the acquisition of two Polish power and 
heat companies in Zabrze and Bytom. In 
Russia, the fi  rst three units of Fortum’s extensive investment programme started 
commercial operation: Tyumen CHP-1 in 
Western Siberia started capacity sales at the beginning of February, Chelyabinsk CHP-3 in the Urals region at the begin-ning of June, and the new capacity in Tobolsk was taken into commercial opera-
tion in the beginning of October 2011. 
Leased and divested capacity 
The Kirkniemi power plant’s capacity was 
leased out for the entire year, as it was 
in the previous year. Fortum’s share of 
Meri-Pori was leased out until the end of June 2010 with no leasing arrangements 
in place in 2011. The production and 
emissions of the leased capacity are not included in Fortum’s specifi  c emissions 
fi  gures, in order to present an accurate view on emissions in relation to produc-tion. However, the leased units have been 
included in the absolute emissions fi  gures.
In 2011, Fortum divested its district 
heat operations outside the Stockholm area in Sweden and the old production line for Stockholm city gas was closed. The 
key fi  gures of the divested plants are not 
included in the reporting for 2011.
data measurement techniques (3.9–3.11)
Data for economic performance indicators is collected from the audited fi  nancial statements and fi  nancial accounting and 
consolidation systems.
The environmental information of 
the report covers the plants for which Fortum is the legal holder of the envi-
ronmental permit. Normally, Fortum is the majority shareholder of such plants, 
but the company can be the holder of a 
plant’s environmental permit also when it is a minority shareholder. In such cases, 
the plant information is reported in its 
entirety, but only the share of production 
and emissions corresponding to Fortum’s 
share of ownership is calculated in the specifi  c emissions fi  gures.
Fortum  utilises a Group-wide database 
with instructions for collecting site-level environmental, health and safety data. 
Sites are responsible for data input, emis-
sions calculations and assurance at the site level. The Corporate Sustainability 
unit compiles all data and is responsible 
for published sustainability information. In 2011, Corporate Sustainability con-
ducted internal site assessment visits to 
the 16 biggest production sites in Finland, Sweden, Poland and Russia.
Fortum’s CO
2 emissions subject to EU 
Emissions Trading Scheme are annually 
verifi  ed at site-level by external verifi  ers.  
Direct and indirect greenhouse gas emis-sions have been reported in accordance assEssmEnT oF susTainabiliTy aspEcTswith the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and based on the Greenhouse Gas Analysis 
performed by an external consultant.  
Fortum’s Human resouces (HR) 
 management system HeRMeS is currently used in Finland, Sweden and Norway, and 
it is the main system for all employee-related personal and job data. During 
2011, HeRMeS was upgraded to better 
support the global HR processes and to enable the roll-out of the system to other 
Fortum countries. The upgrade was the 
fi  rst in a series of investments in the global HR management system. The next 
step is to implement HeRMeS in other 
Fortum countries, starting with Poland. Other social data, such as data related to 
occupational health originates from vari-
ous source systems and is collected by the relevant contact persons and delivered to 
Corporate Sustainability in the format 
recommended by GRI. Fortum recognises 
that due to various source systems the 
process for HR data compilation is not 
robust enough.  The development of HR data management is one of the key action 
items for 2012.  
Global Compact reporting
Fortum has been a member of the United 
Nations Global Compact since June 2010. 
This report describes the realisation of 
the Global Compact’s ten principles in Fortum’s operations. Global Compact 
approves the use of the indicators in the 
GRI G3. 1 Guidelines in Communication 
on Progress (COP) reporting. The GRI 
index presents the indicators used to 
measure Fortum’s performance in fulfi  ll-ing the principles of human rights, labour 
standards, the environment and anti-
corruption.Current or potential impact on Fortumsecurity

governance (4.1–4.10)
Corporate governance at Fortum is based on laws, the company’s Articles of 
Association and the Finnish Corporate 
Governance  Code. The Corporate Gover -
nance Statement is issued annually and 
it presents also the standard disclosure 
elements for the sustainability gover -
nance defined by the GRI guidelines. More

of Directors and company management The CR&S function is responsible for 
the operations of the Group’s sustainability networks. Regularly operating networks 
include the Climate network, which con -
vened four times in 2011, and the Environ -
ment, Health and Safety (EHS) network, which met six times. Other networks are 
established on an ad hoc basis; in 2011, 
a cross-divisional network of bioenergy  
experts focused on Fortum’s positions and 
actions regarding the sustainable use of 
bioenergy . The CR&S function gives sus -
tainability approval (environmental, occu -
pational health, safety and social impacts) for all significant investments, acquisi -
tions and divestments as part of Fortum’s 
Investment Evaluation and Approval Pro -
cedure. The procedure and guidelines were revised during 2011.
sustainability targets and performance
The Fortum Management Team decides on company-level strategy and Group-level 
target setting, including sustainability tar -
gets, to guide annual planning. The divi -
sions define detailed targets and develop action plans supporting the achievement 
of the targets, and they ensure that sustainability goals are included in the 
business goals. Group-level sustainability 
indicators are reported quarterly and the detailed safety and environmental indica -
tors monthly. The Fortum Management Team regularly monitors the achievement of the targets in its monthly meetings and 
in quarterly performance reviews.
In 2011, sustainability-related issues, 
such as the new Group-level target setting and the Code of Conduct revision, were 
regarded as being of pivotal importance and therefore discussed and decided 
upon directly by the Fortum Management 
Team. Therefore, no Sustainability and Public Affairs steering group meetings 
were organised in 2011. (4.5), avoidance of conflict of interests 
(4.6), qualification and expertise of the 
Members of the Board of Directors (4.7), 
internal control framework, values, Code of Conduct and their implementation (4.8), 
Board-level processes for overseeing per -
formance (4.9) and the self-assessment of 
the Board of Directors is described in the 
Corporate Governance Statement 2011.
sustainability management 
and organisation
Fortum has a line responsibility in sus -
tainability governance. The management of the divisions and the Group functions, 
and ultimately the President and CEO and the Board of Directors, are accountable 
for sustainability at Fortum. The Board 
of Directors has not appointed any of its members specifically conversant in 
sustainability thus relies on the expertise 
and information provided by the Fortum Management Team and the Sustainability 
and Public Affairs steering group. For -
tum’s corporate governance is discussed 
on pages 116–123 of the Financials 2011.
The Corporate Relations and Strategy
1) 
(CR&S) function is responsible for coor -
dinating and developing sustainability at the Group level. The Executive Vice President of CR&S reports to the CEO 
and is a member of the Fortum Manage -
ment Team. The Executive Vice President of CR&S  also serves as Chairman of the 
Sustainability and Public Affairs steer -
ing group. The steering group comprises representatives from all divisions and 
Group functions. Among other things, 
the steering group’s tasks include manag -
ing consistent, systematic and efficient 
implementation of Fortum’s sustainability 
approach throughout the organisation.Group-level sustainability targets and 
Fortum’s performance in 2011 are pre -
sented on page 29.
sustainability risk management
Fortum’s Board of Directors approves the Group’s risk policy, which defines risk 
management goals, principles and areas 
of responsibility as well as Fortum’s risk management process. Risk management 
and control processes are described on 
pages 21–26 of the Financials 2011.

Fortum in sustainability indexes
Expert assessments of sustainability and good rankings in significant sustainability 
indexes are important to Fortum because 
they support the development and con -
tinuous improvement of our operations.  
Fortum was ranked the best utility in Car -
bon Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) 
and listed in the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Index DJSI World for the ninth consecutive 
year.  Fortum’s target is to be included also 
in the DSJI Europe index; Fortum’s total 
score was 76, and the threshold score to 
the Europe index was 77 in 2011.
Fortum was awarded SAM Bronze 
Class in the Sustainability Yearbook 2011 published by the SAM Group, and a Prime Status (B-) rating by the German oekom 
research AG in April 2011. Prime Status 
means that Fortum is among the best com -
panies in its sector and fulfils industry-
specific best-in-class requirements.

stakeholder relations. In 2011, Fortum’s CR&S function focused on promoting 
the following areas: Fortum’s image and 
reputation in sustainability, sustainable and carbon dioxide-free power and heat 
production, and solutions for sustainable 
urban living and communities. The goal 
was also to increase knowledge about 
power and heat markets.  
one Fortum measures 
stakeholder expectations 
In 2011, Fortum introduced a new method 
to measure stakeholder expectations in 
relation to the company’s reputation – The 
One Fortum survey. The survey makes it possible to review the differences 
in expectations between stakeholder 
groups and countries and also enables the assessment of stakeholder opinions 
and expectations about sustainability. 
The One Fortum survey covers several stakeholder groups, including customers, 
governmental bodies, capital markets, 
non-governmental organisations and For -
tum’s personnel. In Finland and Sweden, 
the survey covers also the general public. 
The results are reviewed by the top man -

survey also covered customers in other 
countries, such as Germany, Denmark and Great Britain.  
According to the survey, Fortum has 
the strongest reputation within the capi -
tal market and the weakest relationship 
with general public. Fortum’s operations 
and leadership received high scores and had a strong impact on Fortum’s reputa -
tion. The areas that strongly affect For -

employer. Based on the results, social 
responsibility and local community co-operation are included as high-priority 
areas for Fortum’s Corporate Relation s

promote Fortum as an employer also will 
be emphasised.
public affairs and collaboration 
with authorities a priority 
in the energy sector 
As an energy sector expert, Fortum feels 
obligated to express its views on energy 
policy issues and to offer its energy sector 
expertise also to decision-makers and various organisations. Fortum engages 
in an active dialogue about key issues in 
the energy sector and publishes position papers on significant topics. In 2011, 
Fortum also published an overview on 
the energy policy in Finland, Sweden and Poland.
At the EU level and in countries where 
it operates, Fortum is involved in 74 lob -
bying associations and organisations, 
including Eurelectric, Finnish Energy Industries (ET), Svensk Energi, Interna -
tional Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Develop -
ment. In 2011, public affairs efforts in 
Finland focused on the programme of 
the new government elected in April. The 
public affairs activities in Sweden, Poland and the Baltics focused on issues related 
to, e.g., hydropower and the heating sec -
tor. At the EU level, Fortum representa -
tives had several meetings with officials from European institutions. 
In December 2011, Fortum registered 
to the joint transparency register set up and operated by the European Parlia -
ment and the European Commission. The 
register provides parties with informa -
tion about persons engaged in activities aiming at influencing the EU decision making process, which interests are being

km of power transmission and distribution 
network  in Finland, Sweden and Norway.  
About 50%  of the distribution network is 
underground cables. Underground cables are prioritised in network construction, and about 60% of the new distribution network in 
Finland is today constructed underground. 
Fortum’s investment and maintenance costs for the distribution network totalled approx -
imately 289 million euros in 2011.
In 2011, Fortum’s reliability in electric -
ity distribution was 99.90%. Distribution 
reliability was affected by Christmas

efficiency; read more on pages 6 5–66.demand-side management
Eu7 demand-side management 
programmes, including residential, 
commercial, institutional and industrial programmes  
Fortum encourages customer demand 
response by offering market-based hourly 
pricing to business customers and time-of-
use energy pricing and distribution grid tariffs to private customers. It is also pos -
sible to choose a contract with the energy price based on a monthly average of the 
spot price in the Nordic power exchange 
Nord Pool Spot. Fortum also sells home 
displays showing the real time electricity consumption. This information helps the 
customer to shift consumption to off-peak, 
cheaper time periods.
For Fortum’s own generation portfolio 
management, Fortum uses the peak-load 
flexibility of its hydro and thermal power 
plants. In several countries Fortum has major CHP plants that generate peak-load 
power with high efficiency as the heat 
demand coincides with the peak power demand.
Seasonal or two-time tariff s are 
also available encouraging reducti on of 
consumption  during peak loads in the 
winter. In hot water heating, a two-time tariff promotes shifting the demand to 
the night-time throughout the year. For 
B2B customers, there is also a variety of different electricity tariffs suitable for the 
customers’ situation.Fortum’s approach to sustainability man -
agement is discussed on pages 28–29 and 
on sustainability governance on pages 
91–93 .  The key figures by which Fortum 
measures its financial performance 
include return on capital employed (tar -
get: 12%), return on shareholders’ equity 
(target: 14%) and capital structure (target: 
comparable net debt/EBITDA around 3).
The majority of Fortum’s key financial 
figures are published in the Financials 2011 prepared and presented in compli -
ance with International Financial Report -
ing Standards (IFRS). Fortum uses the applicable Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) indicators for reporting economic responsibility and discloses in its Sustain -

fortum’s shares and shareholders
Fortum Corporation’s shares are listed 
on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki exchange. 
At the end of 2011, Fortum had 104,496 
shareholders. The Finnish State owned 50.76% of Fortum’s shares. Of the shares, 
28.3% were in foreign ownership (2010: 
30.2%). More information on Fortum’s shares and shareholders is available on 
pages 10–11 (Financial summary) and in 
the Financials 2011 on pages 27–31. For -
tum’s dividend policy is discussed on page

Fortum provides information to inves -
tors fairly and publishes investor informa -fortum S uStAINABILIt Y report 2011  GrI CoNteNt INDeX 97   Our distribution business has load-
based network tariffs for B2B custom -
ers. Load-based tariffs support efficient 
usage of the electricity system by making demand-side management profitable for 
the customer. For all distribution custom -
ers, it is possible to choose a two-period 
metering and tariff with a higher day-time 
winter energy price. This is suitable espe -
cially for distribution customers with stor -
able electric heating. Load management services are also offered to large customers. 
A huge programme to replace old 
meters with new hourly-based metering will improve the possibilities for both load 
management and energy savings. In Fin -
land, approximately 580,000 customers 
will receive new meters before the end of 
2013. In 2011, the rollout of smart meter -
ing to network customers in Finland 
proceeded according to plan; by the end 
of 2011, 160,000 customers had received new meters. The new Finnish legislation 
on hourly meter reading will become 
effective on 1 January 2014. In Sweden, bringing smart metering to customers 
was completed earlier. The planning of a 
smart meter system in Norway continues, and the preliminary regulation regarding 
it will come into effect on 1 January 2017.
Fortum is also actively promoting the 
introduction of electric vehicles and is developing solutions for the smart charg -
ing of vehicle batteries based on the actual 
power market situation and price.
research and development
Eu8 research and development 
activity and expenditure aimed at 
providing reliable electricity and promoting sustainable development 
The purpose of research and development 
(R&D) is to improve Fortum’s competitive -
ness and to create a foundation for new management including decommission -
ing of the power plants and disposal 
of spent fuel. In Sweden and Finland, 
payments have to be made yearly to the State nuclear waste funds. In Finland, a 
fee including low- and intermediate-level 
waste, disposal of spent nuclear fuel and decommissioning of the nuclear power 
plant is paid every year to the fund. As 
regards Loviisa NPP, for which Fortum bears the full responsibility as the licence 
holder, the legal liability for nuclear waste 
management according to the Nuclear Energy Act at the end of 2011 was EUR 
968 million (2010: 944 million).
In Sweden, payments to nuclear waste 
fund are made yearly by paying fees  based 
on the amount of electricity production. 
Fortum has given the Swedish Nuclear Waste Fund guarantees on behalf of Fors -
mark and Oskarshamn to cover its share of nuclear waste liability .  Fortum’s share of 
guarantees was SEK 2574 million in 2011.
The liability in Sweden and Finland is 
based on the technical planning of radio -
active waste management carried out every third year. 
Nuclear-related assets and liabilities 
are reviewed in more detail on pages 89–90 of the Financials 2011.

 Fortum’s main R&D themes cover the 
most advanced technologies in the current 
energy system and the technologies and 
system solutions that will be needed to enable a future Solar Economy. In 2011, a 
strong focus in R&D was on understanding the potential of various solar technologies. Fortum teamed up with partners in large 
programmes to develop smart grid technol -
ogies, sustainable urban solutions, and new 
integrated combined heat and power (CHP) 
concepts. Nuclear R&D continued to be the 
largest and most valuable part of Fortum’s R&D portfolio, read the case on page 53.
Fortum’s total R&D expenditure in 
2011 was EUR 38 million (2010: 30 mil -
lion). Fortum’s R&D expenditure in 2011 was 0.6% of sales (2010: 0.5%) and 1.1% of total expenses (2010: 0.8%). Read more on

Ec2 Financial implications and other risks 
and opportunities for the organisation’s 
activities due to climate change 
Climate change poses both regulatory 
and physical risks and opportunities for 
Fortum. As energy production and use is 
the largest source of greenhouse gases, the energy sector has a central role in building 
a low-carbon future. The energy industry 
has established visions and roadmaps of the future energy system and is prepared 
to invest in new climate-benign produc -
tion capacity, provided that the supporting 
policy framework and preconditions of 
society are in place.
Fortum’s long-term aspiration is to 
be a CO
2-free power and heat company. 
Fortum is continuously developing its energy production capacity and looking 
for opportunities to reduce emissions. The company’s most important tool in curb -
ing climate change is to increase CO
2-free 98 GrI CoNteNt INDeX fortum  SuStAINABILIt Y report  2011or low-carbon energy production and 
to improve energy efficiency. In 2011, a 
marginal abatement cost analysis of CO 2 
emissions reduction measures was carried out. The analysis identified potential emis -
sions reduction measures, their reduction 
volumes and the level of abatement cost. 
In the short-term, however, Fortum’s CO
2 
emissions are increasing due to the expan -
sion of energy production in Russia.
The primary impact of climate regula -
tion for Fortum is the cost for carbon diox -
ide as a result of the EU Emissions Trading 
System (ETS) and a corresponding value for reductions of emissions. The price of 
CO
2 increases the production cost of fossil-
based energy, but it also raises the prices of energy products. Fortum’s key action to 
reduce exposure to the increasing prices of CO
2 is to increase CO 2-free and low-carbon 
production capacity. In 2011, 85% of For -
tum’s electricity production in the EU was CO
2-free. In 2011, Fortum had a total of 
102 plants in six member states within the 
EU’s emissions trading scheme. About 91% 
of the CO 2 emissions in the EU area were 
included in the emissions trading system. 
In 2011, Fortum was granted 6.8 million 
tonnes in free emissions allowances. The company’s emissions in the EU emissions 
trading scheme were 8.0 million tonnes. 
Thus, in terms of emissions allowances, Fortum was short. 
In the next ETS period, 2013–2020, the 
volume of Fortum’s free allowances will 
decrease significantly, because electricity 
production has to purchase allowances monETary F lows by sT aKEhold Er group FoRTUm’S Co 2 Emissions and E missions allowanc Es in 2009–2011

for electricity production on the basis of the derogation rules of the Emissions 
Trading Directive. 
In Russia, CO 2 emissions have an eco -
nomic value through the Joint Implemen -
tation (JI) mechanism that can be applied 
during the Kyoto period 2008–2012, but most likely not beyond that. Prepara -
tions of two JI projects for approval by the Russian government continued in 2011. Fortum’s all JI projects are estimated to 
generate a total of 2.4 million emission 
reduction units (ERU) by the end of 2012. The conditions of transferring of emission 
reduction units from Russia are still pend -
ing. Fortum is also participating in two 
international climate funds, the Prototype 
Carbon Fund (PCF) and the Testing Ground 
Facility. During 2011, Fortum received 110,000 emission reduction units from 
these funds.
Fortum is exposed to physical risks 
of climate change, including changes in weather patterns that may change energy 
demand and supply from e.g., hydropower plants. More frequent and intensive storms 
may impact the operation and mainte -
nance of the distribution network. Higher 
precipitation may affect hydropower pro -
duction, dam safety and bioenergy supply. In addition to climate change mitigation, Fortum is also taking measures to adapt 
its operations to climate change. In 2011,

finalised. Based on the results, changes are 
being implemented in inflow forecasting and in production planning.
Concern about climate change is 
expected to result in an increasing 
demand for low-carbon and energy-
efficient energy products and solutions. Fortum’s know-how in CO
2-free  hydro and 
nuclear power and in energy-efficient CHP 
as well as research and development in the 
future energy system and technologies, like wave and solar energy, can prove to be 
a competitive advantage. Fortum is invest -

Ec6 policy practices and 
spending on local suppliers 
Fortum buys fuels, goods and services 
from international and local suppliers. In 2011, the economic benefits generated to suppliers totalled EUR 2.6 billion (2010: 2.8 billion) which corresponds to 42% 
(2010: 44%) of Fortum’s sales. Altogether, 
Fortum had some 17,000 suppliers of goods and services, nearly 75% of them were operating in Europe, mostly in Fin -
land and Sweden based on the volume of purchases. Of the fuels, Fortum acquired uranium from Russia. The majority (88%) 
of the coal used in Finland and Sweden 
also originated from Russia, with small purchases from Colombia. Coal used 
in Polish power plants originated from 
Poland and Russia, and Fortum’s Russian

gas, which is purchased from several sup -
pliers. In the UK, Fortum uses partly local gas, which is purchased from the national supplier and partly Norwegian gas from 
the North Sea. Gas used in Finland origi -
nates from Russia.
The majority (70%) of the biofuels used 
consisted of wood pellets, wood chips and 
industrial wood residues, and they origi -
nated mainly from Sweden, Finland and 
Germany. Other types of biofuels were 
also acquired from Malaysia, Spain and Brazil. Read more on the criteria and ori -
gin of biofuels used by Fortum on pages 
68–71.  
Of the total annual purchasing volume 
(EUR 2.6 billion), fuels accounted for about EUR 900 million (2010: 960 million), 
with fossil fuels accounting for EUR 655 million and biofuels EUR 175 million. 
In 2011, Fortum’s investments, exclud -
ing acquisitions, were EUR 1,408 million (2010: EUR 1,222 million), 262 million 
(2010: 214 million) of which was for CO
2-
free production. Investments totalled 22% of sales (2010: 19%). Fortum’s investments 
have a significant local impact, as they create business and job opportunities for 
local suppliers and develop the local infra -
structure. The biggest investments were 
made in Russia, EUR 670 million (2010: 
599 million), and in Sweden, EUR 392 
million (2010: 300 million). Investments in renewable energy forms were EUR 247 
million (2010: 182 million).
Ec7 local hiring procedures and 
proportions of local senior management  
In local hiring, Fortum uses advertised 
recruitment and direct search methods. In 
Finland and Sweden, 100% of senior man -
agement are locals. In Russia, the corre -
sponding figure is 77%. In Poland, the only Vice President position is held by a Finn.Ec8 development and impact of 
infrastructure investments and 
services provided primarily for public benefit, through commercial in-kind or pro bono engagement 
Fortum supports organisations and com -
munities working for the common good in 
the countries where it operates. The goal 
is for sponsorships to be mutually benefi -
cial. Collaboration in research and devel -
opment projects with Nordic universities in particular is significant.  
In 2011, Fortum’s support for public 
good totalled about EUR 4.6 million (2010: 5.2 million), of which the share of grants awarded by the Fortum Foundation was 
about EUR 700,000 (2010: 650,000). The 
purpose of the Fortum Foundation is to support research, education and develop -
ment in natural, technical and economi -
cal sciences within the energy area. In 2011, Fortum Foundation granted scholar -
ships to 39 students.
In addition to this, Fortum donated for 
R&D cooperation about EUR 2.8 million 
(2010: 2.3 million) to universities in Fin -
land. The single largest donation, EUR 1.5 
million, was awarded to Aalto University.  
Fortum’s investments in infrastruc -
ture – especially in the Chelyabinsk heat ring in Russia – provide public benefits. However, as Fortum’s investments in heat 
rings have also economic and environ -
mental benefits, they are not regarded as 
the investments referred to in the GRI. 
The amount to be donated to non-
profit targets is decided by Fortum’s Board of Directors. Donations are not awarded 
for any kind of political activities, reli -
gious organisations, authorities, munici -
palities or local administrations. Nor are they ever part of business agreements.Ec9 understanding and describing 
significant indirect economic impacts, 
including the extent of impacts 
Fortum supports social development and 
well-being by e.g., increasing local employ -
ment and paying taxes, salaries and social security costs. The tax benefits Fortum produces for society include income taxes 
and taxes related to the business opera -
tions – such as property and fuel taxes. 
Fortum also has pass-through taxes, such 
as the value added tax, and withholding 
taxes, which Fortum is obligated to collect and report on behalf of the government. 
Fortum’s total tax impact depends on 
the profitability of operations, the scale of the local operations and the investments 
being implemented. In 2011, Fortum paid 
income, property and production taxes totalling EUR 721 million (2010: 634 mil -
lion), of which EUR 250 million (2010: 210 million) was paid in Finland and EUR 440 million (2010: 383 million) in Sweden. 
Fuel taxes totalled EUR 74 million (2010: 
58 million), of which 22% (2010: 45%) com -
prised a carbon dioxide tax and 2% (2010: 
1%) a sulphur tax. 
 The dividend income on the Finnish 
State shares has an impact on maintain -
ing social infrastructure. Fortum’s indi -
rect economic impacts are discussed on

Fortum is currently investing substan -
tially in new energy production capacity 
both in Russia and Europe. In Russia, 
Fortum is committed to a EUR 2.5 bil -
lion investment programme with a total 
capacity of 2, 400 MW electricity and 662 
MW heat; the last units are scheduled for commissioning in 2014. The Russian 
investment programme is based mainly 
on natural gas, whereas the investments in 
Europe (~ 800 MW electricity and 225 MW 
heat under construction) target mainly 
CO 2-free production. Fortum’s European 
investment plan, extensive investment programme in Russia and acquisitions 
in 2011 are presented on pages 62–64. Fortum’s understanding of European and 
Russian power demand expectations as 
well as the development of primary energy demand by region is discussed on pages 
30–39 (Market development).  
System efficiency
Eu11 average generation 
efficiency of thermal plants 
Fortum has a Group-level target (>70%) for 
overall efficiency of fuel-use as a 5-year 
average, see page 29. Efficiency in 2011 
was 67.1% and the 5-year rolling average 68.3%. Fortum’s target setting is based on the present production portfolio, planned 
new capacity both in Europe and Russia, 
as well as planned actions for increased efficiency and flexible fuel use.
Eu12 Transmission and distribution

Fortum’s approach to sustainability man -
agement is discussed on pages 28–29  and 
on sustainability governance on pages 
91–93. Policies and instructions to guide environmental management include: For -
tum’s Sustainability Policy and environ -
mental principles, biodiversity guidelines, commitment to the UN Global Compact, 
and compliance with the ISO 14001 stan -
dard for environmental management. 
Environmental responsibility at 
Fortum emphasises the efficient use 
of resources and the need to mitigate climate change and highlights our know-
how in CO
2-free hydro and nuclear power 
production and in energy-efficient CHP production. Research and development 
activities create requisites for environ -
mentally benign energy solutions. Climate 
change mitigation and the reduction of 
carbon dioxide emissions are important goals that affect the energy sector and 
the development of electricity and heat 
production. In addition to new technical innovations, also efficient and low-emis -
sion traditional production technologies will be needed for a long time.
Certified environmental management
Fortum’s target is to certify all its opera -
tions according to ISO 14001. At the end 
of 2011, Fortum’s overall certification rate 
was 95%. The operations of Jelgava in Lat -
via, Pärnu in Estonia and as well as For -
tum Fjernvarme in Norway were certified in 2011. In Fortum’s Russian operations, 
preparations for ISO 14001 certification 
continued actively during 2011 and were well ahead of the original schedule. In 
December 2011, OAO Fortum’s operations 
passed the first phase of the ISO 14001 certification audit representing 70% of Fortum’s operations in Russia. The plan is 
to expand the scope of the certificate also 
to include the new Nyagan power plant as well as the district heating networks in 
OAO Fortum during 2012.
The certification rates are based on 
the share of net sales generated in certi -
fied operations (2011 net sales values) out 
of Fortum’s total sales.
environmental targets and performance
Fortum’s Group-level environmental tar -
gets are related to CO 2 emissions, energy 
efficiency and environmental manage -
ment system (ISO 14001) certification. In addition, the divisions have defined their own environmental goals related to their 
respective business.The achievement of the Group-level 
environmental targets is monitored through quarterly and annual report -
ing. In addition, leaks of more than 100 
litres into the environment, significant 
permit violations and environmental non-
compliances are monitored monthly as part of environmental, health and safety 
(EHS) reporting. As there have been no 
Group-level targets for environmental non-compliances or leaks, the divisions 
have set their own goals, which have been 
reviewed and followed-up in the Group’s EHS network.

En1 materials used by weight or volume
fuel and energy use
Fortum’s major materials and energy 
use consists of fuels. Fortum produces 
electricity and heat from a diverse range 
of energy sources: in Europe mostly from renewable and low-carbon energy sources 
and in Russia from fossil fuels. In its 
operations Fortum aims to use natural resources efficiently and sparingly. In 
order to decrease the environmental 
impacts, the operations are continuously improved with modern technology as well 
as efficient operating and maintenance 
procedures.
Detailed fuel and energy use is 
described in EN3.
other materials use
In addition to fuels, other large-scale mate -
rials used in energy production include 
auxiliary chemicals for flue gas cleaning, 
e.g., limestone, ammonia and urea. En2 percentage of materials used 
that are recycled input materials
Waste-derived fuels from industrial and municipal waste are recycled input mate -
rials and an increasingly important part of Fortum’s fuel mix. Waste-derived fuels are used for heat and electricity produc -
tion in waste incineration plants and in co-combustion with other fuels. In 2011, Fortum used 754,000 tonnes of waste-
derived fuels in Sweden and Finland. 
Fortum used 40,000 tonnes of imported waste for energy production in Sweden. 
The waste originates from Norway and 
is municipal, burnable waste (code: EWC 191210). Waste supplier companies hold 
the licences for waste import. Fortum 
is responsible for reporting its annual imports of waste to the authorities.
Recycled input materials accounted 
for 2% of the energy content of Fortum’s total fuel use.

In case of external energy supply, the 
reported consumption has been converted to primary energy by assuming 75% 
energy efficiency for power production and 85% for heat production.
En5 Energy saved due to conservation 
and efficiency improvements
In fuel-based energy production Fortum aims to utilise the fuel as efficiently as 
possible. In 2011, Fortum’s efficiency of 
fuel use was 67.1 % (target 70% as a five-year average). 
Energy-efficient CHP production, in 
which up to 90% of the energy content of 
the fuel can be utilised, is Fortum’s most 
important tool to increase efficiency of fuel use. CHP plants accounted for 29% of 
Fortum’s total  electricity production and 
71% of heat production in 2011. 
The implementation of the energy 
analyses, energy-efficiency training and 
technology measures related to Fortum’s 
2008 – 2016 energy efficiency programme 
continued in 2011. The goal of the pro -
gramme is to improve energy efficiency in power plants in Sweden, Finland, and Great Britain by 600 GWh per year. The 
main focus is on improving power plant 
efficiency and on increasing the capacity of CO
2-free production. About 30 projects 
will be implemented every year. In 2011, 
the efficiency improvements resulted in 
an energy savings of about 90  GWh.Hydropower refurbishment projects 
and heat recovery measures in Kuusamo, Nokia and the Suomenoja CHP plants as well as the Ecotuning™ project at the 
Kauttua power plant were among the 
energy-efficiency improvement projects implemented in 2011. Additionally, the 
optimisation of the district heat networks 
continued in Stockholm, where Fortum produces about 650 GWh of heat by recov -
ering heat from flue gases.
Fortum is participating in the Euro -
pean electricity sector’s Energy Wisdom 
programme and reports on its projects 
that improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gases. The programme reports 
are available at www.eurelectric.org.
In addition to improving the energy 
efficiency of energy production, Fortum also aims to improve the efficiency of 
electricity distribution by reducing distri -
bution losses. In 2011, distribution losses 
amounted to 1.4 TWh (2010: 1.5 TWh)
En6 initiatives to provide energy-
efficient or renewable energy-
based products and services, and reductions in energy requirements as a result of these initiatives
Fortum is contributing to a low-carbon 
society by offering products and services 
that can help mitigate climate change also 
in other sectors of society. A more detailed description of environmentally benign 
products is given in EN26.
In addition, Fortum provides custom -
ers with energy advice, offers energy-efficiency consulting services to industrial 
customers as well as energy-saving prod -
ucts like energy consumption metering 
devices (e.g. Kotinäyttö/Home Display).En7 initiatives to reduce indirect energy 
consumption and reductions achieved
Indirect energy consumption (own use of 
energy) in the operation of power plants 
is reduced by increasing the operational 
efficiency of the plants. The energy effi -
ciency of a power plant can be enhanced 
with structural modifications, systematic 
and preventive maintenance, and by train -
ing personnel in the optimal operation 
and monitoring of the plant’s operational 
economy. Fortum’s portfolio of services and expertise covers all these areas.
Fortum has invested heavily in 
automatic meter management in power distribution in Sweden and Finland in 
recent years. This improves the quality of 
loss data and creates new possibilities for load management, which in turn reduces 
distribution losses. Losses in power distri -
bution can also be reduced by optimising 
network operations, increasing transmis -
sion capacity in the most loaded lines and replacing obsolete transformers with new, more energy efficient ones. 
Distribution losses decreased by about 
7% from 2010 to 2011. Fortum’s distribu -
tion losses were about 3. 3% of total power 
distribution in 2011. The amount of elec -
tricity acquired from external sources for operating power plants decreased from 
1759 GWh in 2010 to 969 GWh in 2011 (a 
45% decrease).

thermal energy plants into ash ponds.
In hydropower production, water is 
entirely passed through the turbines; the volume and quality of water remains 
unchanged. 
EN9 Water sources significantly 
affected by withdrawal of water
Fortum withdraws water from the sea, 
lake or river, and the withdrawn volume 
is small compared to the watercourse vol -
ume and flow, none of these water sources 
is significantly affected. Water scarcity 
is not an issue in the operation areas of 
Fortum’s power plants. 
In Poland, Fortum uses mainly munic -
ipal tap water. Poland is the only Fortum’s area of operation defined as a water-stressed area. Fortum’s sites in Poland are 
mostly small, but a few are medium-sized. 
The aggregated water consumption is about 800,000 m
3 annually. No risk of

Fortum’s Gisela system includes informa -
tion on real estate and other properties of 
the company. The system contains data on 
protected areas and areas of high biodiver -
sity value in close proximity to Fortum’s 
activities.
Fortum owns and operates several 
energy production facilities adjacent to protected areas. For example, the Loviisa 
nuclear power plant in Finland is located near nature conservation areas belong -
ing to the Natura 2000 network: the Källaudden-Virstholmen area is located approximately two kilometres from the 
power plant, a sea conservation area about 
two kilometres, and the Kullafjärden bird waters and bird nesting area, and the bays 
seven kilometres from the Loviisa power 
plant. 
In addition, the Kuggen bird conserva -
tion area is about 3 km and the nature conservation area of islands Hudö and Lilla-Hudö about 4 km from the power 
plant. North of Hästholmen, on the main -
land, the nearest nature conservation 
areas are located about 2 km from the 
power plant. 
The Loviisa nuclear power plant area 
is made up of 170 hectares of land and 240 hectares of water areas.
There are many nature conservation 
areas close to Fortum’s hydro power plants in Finland and Sweden. In Finland, two 
hydropower plants on the Paimionjoki river are located in a Natura 2000 area of 
156 ha. The area is a habitat of e.g., thick 
shelled river mussel (Unio Crassus). The Mustionjoki river, which has four of For -
tum’s hydropower plants, is included in the Natura 2000 network and is an impor -
tant habitat for  thick shelled river mussel 
and river pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera). The size of this Natura 2000 area is 188 ha.
In Sweden, a 100-km-long stretch on 
the Klarälven river between two Fortum’s hydropower plants is a protected area 
according to the Environmental Code 
and Natura 2000. The protected species is salmon. Fortum’s real estate at the Untra 
Hydro Power Plant on the Dalälven river 
has Natura 2000 areas with a size of 460 ha. Båtfors is a large nature conserva -
tion area and Natura 2000 area located directly downstream the Untra plant. The water part of Dalälven river also belongs 
to Natura 2000. Fortum’s real estate out -
side the conservation areas at Untra has 
recently been voluntary protected by For -
tum. Out of the total 350 ha, an environ -
mental management plan covers 260 ha. EN12 Description of significant 
impacts of activities, products, and services on biodiversity in protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas
Fortum’s impacts on biodiversity – flora 
and fauna species – are often local and 
mainly linked to the use of land and water 
areas and the exploitation of renewable energy sources. Fortum’s activities in 
hydropower production and electricity 
distribution may have a negative impact in areas of high biodiversity. The impacts 
of hydropower production are, in some 
cases, connected to dams as migration barriers for fish and reduction of rapids 
as habitats. Cooling waters from thermal 
and nuclear plants also may affect the bio -
diversity of the aquatic environment. 
For example, cooling waters raise the 
sea water temperature near the Loviisa power plant. The temperature of the sur -
face water during the vegetation period (May-October) increases by 1–2.5 centi -
grades within a one- to two-kilometre dis -
tance from the power plant. The impact of the power plant on biodiversity is the eutrophication of the aquatic vegetation in 
the shorelines near the power plant.
En13 habitats protected or restored
Habitats for fish reproduction were 
restored at the Utosjoki river, a tributary 
of the Oulujoki river in Finland. The aim 
of the restoration was to create spawning and juvenile habitats for salmonoid fish. 
The restoration was carried out within 
the Oulujoki multiple use agreement in co-operation with municipalities and 
environmental authorities and was fina -

En14 strategies, current actions, 
and future plans for managing 
impacts on biodiversity
Fortum’s biodiversity guidelines set the 
principles for taking biodiversity into con -
sideration and for managing the impacts of the company’s operations on biodiver -
sity. Fortum recognises that biodiversity 
is an essential element of sustainable 
development on a global and local scale. We want to make a positive contribution 
to the conservation of biodiversity in all 
areas where we operate.
The main impacts on biodiversity are 
assessed in the pre-study phase of any project, e.g., a hydropower project, before the investment decision. For example, in 
the pre-study of the refurbishment project 
for the Imatra Hydro Power Plant, the fish spawning areas, the impacts and the 
habitat restoration possibilities are being 
assessed with habitat modelling and field measurements.
Biodiversity impacts are assessed in 
depth as part of the EIA (Environmental 
Impact Assessment) process. If an invest -
ment project impacts a specific species, it may result in a modification in the design of the plant, in measures to preserve a 
high ecological value, including relocating 
the plant if the existing biotope could be damaged as a result of the project, or in 
restoration measures.One example is the development of 
the Untra Hydro Power Plant in Sweden, 
where a new unit/station will be built. Extensive environmental inventories 
have been done in connection to  the EIA . 
Insect and bird habitats have been listed 
and descriptions of area development 
measures are part of the EIA. There will 
be no increase in water discharge, due to high ecological values. The planned hydro -
power plant was moved to the other side of the river in order to minimise the envi -
ronmental impact. Cultural aspects have 
been considered  as well ; the Untra Power 
Plant dates back to the beginning of 1900, 
so changes in and outside of the buildings 
are restricted.
Fortum inventories the biodiversity 
in areas where it operates in order to pre -
serve and increase the knowledge of the 
ecological values. In Sweden, for example, rehabilitation of spawning areas of migra -
tory fish in the Dala river was studied in 2011. The work of creating biodiversity 
action plans for Fortum’s hydropower pro -
duction is ongoing. Fortum also encour -
ages authorities and NGOs to suggest ways in which Fortum can minimise its impact 
on biodiversity. 
Fortum’s Environmental Fund sup -
ports projects that reduce the adverse environmental impacts of hydropower 
production and support biodiversity in built-up water systems. Funds originate 
from the sales of “Ekoenergia” eco-labelled 
electricity in Finland and “Bra Miljöval” eco-labelled electricity in Sweden. Dur -
ing 2011 approximately EUR 300,000 was invested in various projects. The Fund’s research or practical projects are chosen 
in collaboration with national nature con -
servation organisations.In addition to Environmental Fund 
projects, many voluntary projects and 
studies were carried out by Fortum in co-operation with authorities, municipalities 
and research institutes in 2011. A unique, 
natural diversion channel, or “biochan -
nel”, was built in 2010 in Eldbäcken, 
Sweden, to bypass a hydropower plant. A 
diverse habitat for fish and fresh-water pearl mussels will be created in the chan -
nel. Follow-up of the functionality of the channel continued in 2011.
In the Oulujoki river in Finland, plans 
for a fish way in the main channel were finalised in 2011. To restock the fish in the area, the stocking of juvenile salmon was 
tested in tributaries. 
The effects of different breeding meth -
ods and changes in fish farming pools on smolt quality as well as the effects of 
different release locations and times was studied in Finland. In Sweden, Fortum 
has its own project focusing on salmon 
released in Lake Vänern.
Enhancing the habitat for the salmon 
population and the endangered fresh-water pearl mussel in the Mustionjoki river in Finland was studied in 2009–2010. 
During 2011, the fertility of fresh-water 
pearl mussels and spawning conditions for salmonoid fish were studied in more 
depth in the Mustionjoki river area.
Fortum’s biodiversity guidelines set 
the principles for taking biodiversity into consideration in grid operations. Under -
ground cabling protects biodiversity and 
reduces the impact on the landscape and 
birds. Measures to avoid bird collisions 
and electric shocks include isolation of the live parts of the network and mounting 
marker balls on overhead lines and land -
ing perches on poles. Whenever possible, 
new networks are constructed in public 
areas and along road sides.En15 number of iucn r ed list species

Saimaa ringed-seal (Pusa hispida saimen -
sis) in Finland is one of the world’s most 
endangered seals. Fortum has been 
working long to protect this species with Finnish Association for Nature Conserva -
tion. Fortum has supported fishermen to replace fishing nets with fish traps to prevent seals from dying in nets. During 
certain years, Fortum’s discharges in river 
Vuoksi have helped seal calves to survive in the nests. This is an example of species 
positively affected by Fortum’s actions. 
The Gullspång population of the 
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)  was red-
listed in Sweden until 2010 and Fortum 
has a responsibility for its survival. Successful efforts have been made down -
stream from the Gullspång hydropower plant in Sweden, in co-operation with authorities. In addition to the restoration 
of spawning areas, other extensive mea -
sures also have been done to preserve the 
salmon. 
At the Untra hydropower plant in 
Sweden, an inventory of the real estate was made and 65 red-listed species where 
identified. The species are listed in the 
inventory report and the level of extinc -
tion risk is also presented.
In Sweden, an eel protection project 
was launched during 2011. The aim is 
to initiate measures to protect the IUCN 
red-listed eel ( Anguilla anguilla ) in the 
most important eel rivers in the country. 
The objective is to decrease eel mortality 
in turbines through trap-and-transport 
and the release into safe waters. The project is being carried out in collabora -
tion with other hydropower companies and the Swedish Agency for Marine and 106 GrI CoNteNt INDeX fortum  SuStAINABILIt Y report  2011Water Management (Havs och vattenmyn -

Emissions, effluents and waste
En16 Total direct and indirect 
greenhouse gas emissions by weight
Carbon dioxide (C o2)
In 2011, Fortum emitted 23.5 million 
(2010: 25.3 million) tonnes of CO 2. 63% of 
the amount resulted from the Russian 
operations, 25% from Finland and 5% 
from Poland. Fortum’s total emissions decreased slightly from the previous year, 
due to the decreased use of fossil-fuelled 
power plants in the Nordic countries. 
The specific CO
2 emission of total energy production decreased to 192 g/kWh 
(2010: 196). The five-year average, includ -
ing 2011, increased to 169 g/kWh (2010: 
157) as a consequence of the increased 
share of Russian energy production in 
the total mix. The specific CO 2 emission 
of power production in the EU was 88 g/
kWh (2010: 84) and the five-year average, 
including 2011, is 67 g/kWh (2010: 69).
total greenhouse gas emissions
Fortum reports greenhouse gases in accordance with the principles of the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol recommended 
by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The reporting covers direct and indirect 
CO
2, methane (CH 4), and dinitrogenoxide 
(N2O) emissions. Indirect emissions are 
calculated using literature based emis -
sion factors and assumptions on different 
parts of the fuel chains.
In 2011 80% of Fortum’s greenhouse gas 
emissions were direct CO 2 emissions (scope 
1), which are generated when burning fos -
sil fuels to produce electricity and heat. Additionally, the direct emissions include the CO
2 emissions of company cars. The 
share of indirect emissions from electricity, 
heat and steam purchased from outside 
sources (scope 2) was 0.7% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Indirect emissions from the 
production and transportation of fuels, 
from employee air travel and from the use of our products (scope 3), accounted for 19% 
of greenhouse gas emissions.
The share of carbon dioxide of CO 2 equivalent emissions was 88% and the 
share of other greenhouse gases (CH 4 and 
N2O) was about 12%.
En17 other relevant indirect 
greenhouse gas emissions by weight
SF6 is used as isolation gas in switchgear 
at a number of substations located in 
urban areas. SF 6 is a strong greenhouse 
gas, but the gas volume is low and the gas is well confined in the equipment. In 2011, 
about 14  kg of SF
6 was leaked into the 
atmosphere from Fortum’s installations. 
En18 initiatives to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions and reductions achieved
New C o2-free and low-carbon capacity
Fortum’s most important measure in curbing climate change is to increase CO
2-
free or low-carbon energy production and 
to improve energy efficiency.
 In line with its strategy, Fortum is 
focusing on CO 2-free  hydro and nuclear 
power and on energy-efficient combined heat and power (CHP) production. Emis -
sions trading and the use of Kyoto mecha -
nisms are also important climate actions at Fortum.
New CO
2-free and low-carbon produc -
tion capacity commissioned during 2011 is described on page 64.
Switching to biofuels
Increasing the use of bioenergy was stud -
ied at many plants during 2011. An envi -ronmental permit application to use 2% of biomass with coal in the Naantali com -
bined heat and power (CHP) unit 1 was 
submitted in 2011. A permit application to 
start using biomass with a share of 5–15% 
of the plant’s total fuel consumption at the Suomenoja CHP plant was also submitted. 
Furthermore, Fortum will increase the 
use of biofuels in Värtan, Sweden. The share of olive stones will be doubled from 
the current 10% to 20% during 2012. Small 
biofuel-fired, heat-only boilers were con -
structed in Vaasa, Vaajakoski and Oulu, in 
Finland. Replacement of coal with biofu -
els using gasification or bio-torrefaction 
was researched in 2011.
In February 2012 Fortum made a deci -
sion on  a pyrolysis plant to be built at the 
Joensuu CHP plant. The plant will produce 
50,000 tonnes ( corresponding to  200–220 
GWh of fuel energy ) of bio-oil annually, 
and it will be the first commercial-scale 
demonstration plant on pyrolysis tech -
nology. Primary raw materials will be 
sawdust and forest residues. Pyrolysis oil 
will replace the use of heavy fuel oil in 
heat-only boilers and power plants. The use of 200 GWh of pyrolysis oil instead of 
heavy fuel oil can reduce CO
2 emissions by 
about 60,000 tonnes.
Cutting emissions by improving 
energy efficiency
Fortum’s activities in improving energy 
efficiency are described in EN5.
CCS as future abatement technology
In Fortum’s view, carbon capture and stor -
age (CCS) will be an important abatement 
measure of CO 2 emissions and has to play 
a pivotal role in energy system transfor -
mation in the future. In 2011, Fortum 
participated in CCS research programmes in Finland and the EU. Fortum was the

1,000 T onnE s tum’s European production plants have 
decreased significantly in recent decades 
as a result of advancements in flue-gas 
cleaning technology and combustion process control. About 59% of the flue-gas 
emissions (SO
2 and NO x) and about 92% of 
the particle emissions originated from the Russian operations. The most significant 
source of particle emissions, 9400 tonnes in 2011, is the Argayash plant in Russia.
The single most important emis -
sions reduction measure in 2011 was the 
change of the coal used at Argayash CHP 
and Chelyabinsk CHP-2 in Russia. About 55% of the annual consumption of coal 
has been switched to a higher quality coal 
with an ash content of 17–21%, compared to the previous coal with an ash content 
of 41–46%. The sulphur content has also 
decreased from 0.9% to 0.5%. The annual reduction of particle emissions per used 
tonne of coal is estimated to be 30%. How -
ever, due to the increased coal consump -
tion, the total particle and SO
2 emissions 
in Russia increased in 2011.
En21 Total water discharge by 
quality and destination
Energy production impacts on water sys -
tems are mainly caused by thermal loads, the release of solids, and by nitrogen, 
phosphorus and heavy metal emissions. All waste water is conducted directly to 
municipal sewage treatment plants or 
cleaned on-site before being discharged into the environment.
In 2011, Fortum used a total of 3,7 50 
million m3 (2010: 3,550  million) of cool -
ing water that was mostly discharged to 
the watercourse. The thermal load on 
the water systems was 21 TWh (2010: 23). The biggest single water consumption 
and effluent volume in 2011 was at the 
Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant in Finland, where 1,437 million m

Ash and by-products from thermal energy
About 829,000 tonnes of ash and 34,200 tonnes of gypsum were generated in 2011. 
About 30% of the ash was generated at 
Finnish plants, 34% in Russia and 19% in Sweden. In Europe, waste and by-products is represented in ZEP, the Zero Emission 
Platform. However, the feasibility of CCS 
still faces major technical, economic, social and political challenges. Fortum 
currently considers the so-called second 
generation CCS concepts and technologies more promising than the technologies 
previously researched. The current cost 
level of CCS does not yet offer solid busi -
ness cases for successful investments.

that the cooling water has increased the 
temperature of surface water by 1–2 ºC within a distance of 1–2 kilometres from 
the discharge point.
In Russia, the wet method is used to 
pump ash from coal-fired power plants into ash basins. Waste waters from the 
basins are led into water systems. The water consumption is quite large and the 
allowed pollutant concentration levels in 
the discharged water were exceeded at six power plants a total of 20 times during 
the year. To correct the situation, arrange -
ments for minimising water flows from 
the plants to ash ponds were made and 
water treatment was improved. The coal 
change is also likely to result in a reduced amount of effluent.
Emissions to water from Fortum’s 
thermal energy plants included 117 tonnes 
of solids, 2.9 tonnes of oil, 14 tonnes of 
nitrogen, and 0.7 tonnes of phosphorus.2009 2010 20110510152025303540

possible. In Russia, ash is stored in basins 
because, excluding building embank -
ments for ash basins, it does not have 
other usages, and the wet ash handling 
makes utilisation more difficult. In 2011, 
the ash recycling rate at Fortum was 52% and the gypsum recycling rate 89%.
Gypsum is utilised in the gypsum 
board industry. Fly ash was used in the construction material industry, in road 
construction, as made-up ground and in 
backfilling mines. New product develop -
ment for ash was carried out in 2011 in 
collaboration with different parties. A CE 
mark covering the cement and concrete industry was received for coal fly ash at 
the Naantali CHP plant. In Sweden, a 
project to build a test road with slag from municipal waste incineration at Högdalen, 
in Stockholm, continued. 
Remaining waste that cannot be util -
ised is deposited in landfills or intermedi -
ate storage. In 2011, about 400,000 tonnes 
of ash and 3,600 tonnes of gypsum were piled. 
Nuclear waste
In 2011, Fortum used 23 tonnes of uranium fuel at the Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant and 
produced a corresponding amount of high-
level radioactive nuclear waste. In addition, about 120 m
3 of low- and intermediate-
level radioactive waste was produced. After 
measuring the radioactivity, some of the 
low-level waste was reclassified as non-radioactive waste and was disposed of like 
other conventional waste.
Low- and intermediate-level nuclear 
waste is disposed of in the final repository at the power plant site in Loviisa. During 
2011, 486 barrels (200 litres each) of low-level maintenance waste were disposed 
of in the repository. In 2011, 70% of the capacity of the repository was in use. In 
2011, 130 m3 of liquid waste was produced. 
This liquid waste, like evaporation waste 
and the ion exchange resins, will be solidi -
fied before final disposal. The volume of 
the evaporation waste is further reduced 
with a caesium removal system before 
solidification.

Ekoenergia label of the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation.
In 2011, all electricity in Sweden was 
sold with an environmental value. Custom -
ers can actively choose between a mix of wind and hydro, which is also labelled with Bra Miljöval, or they can choose to have 
their energy entirely from either wind or 
hydropower. The Bra Miljöval eco-label was founded and reviewed by the Swedish Soci -
ety for Nature Conservation. The electricity sold as entirely wind or hydropower is based on European guarantees of origin. Custom -
ers not making an active choice receive nuclear power, which is CO
2-free in the 
production phase. Assigned deliveries (For -
tum Enkel) have Bra Miljöval eco-labelled wind and hydro power in their delivery. In Finland, Fortum launched a carbon-neutral 
heating product in 2011 to offer customers 
the opportunity to influence their CO
2 emis -
sions. Companies are able to offset their CO 2 
emissions resulting from their use of heat. 
The product is flexible and enables the cus -
tomer to increase the amount of compensa -
tion each year. The compensation is done by purchasing international carbon offsets.

in 2011 included a detailed environmental 
dashboard for monitoring the performance 
and improvement of water treatment. The dashboard contains data on emissions and 
waste, environmental aspects and environ -
mental fees. The water treatment systems 
at Chelyabinsk CHP1, CHP2 and CHP3 and 
at the Tobolsk power plant were improved 
by deploying chemical treatment and closed loop water systems operation.
In the Distribution business area, the 
impacts of network operations on ground water areas received attention. In Nor -
way, for instance, a project to change the transformer oil to a biodegradable oil was carried out. 
In 2012, numerical Group-level goals 
will be set on environmental non-com -
pliances and leaks. A special focus will be on the reduction of environmental non-compliances in Russian operations and 
the reduction of leaks in the Heat Division 
and Distribution business area. In the Power Division, the target is to maintain 
the achieved level of zero environmental 
non-compliances.
Transport
EN29 Significant environmental 
impacts of transporting products and other goods and materials used for the organisation’s operations, and transporting members of the workforce
Fortum reports the greenhouse gas 
emissions of its company car fleet and 
the company benefit cars operated by its 
employees. In 2011, the CO 2 emissions 
from Fortum’s cars were 3,900 tonnes . 
Fortum also reports the CO 2 emissions 
from the flights of its employees and off -sets for the emissions annually. In 2011, the CO
2 emission from Fortum’s air travel 
was 4,600 tonnes. Together,  Fortum’s cars 
and air travel accounted for 0.03% of the 
total GHG emissions.
The indirect emissions from the trans -
portation of coal, oil and wood fuels have been roughly estimated. The CO
2 emission 
was of the order 260,000 tonnes in 2011, 
contributing to less than 1% of Fortum’s 
total GHG emissions. 
Transporting fuels and materials by 
road and rail results in emissions of SO 2, 
NO x and particles. Fortum has no relevant 
information on the transport equipment 
of the fuel suppliers and therefore these 
emissions cannot be calculated.
Neighbours of the Inkoo and Meri-
Pori coal-fired power plants as well as the local authority have brought attention to dusting of coal when it is offloaded from 
ships. The origin of the problem was the 
cold weather in the coal mining area that resulted in a higher dry solids-content of 
the coal and the consequent dusting. In 
order to mitigate the local impact, Fortum 
aims to avoid coal deliveries during the 
winter season.
overall
En30 Total environmental protection 
expenditures and investments by type
eHS costs
Fortum’s Environmental, Health and 
Safety (EHS) expenditures (EHS invest -
ments and operating costs) are costs resulting from measures that primarily aim to manage and reduce the environ -
mental impacts of Fortum’s operations or to improve operational safety. Costs are defined as EHS costs regard -
less of whether the measures are manda -
tory on the basis of legislation or permit conditions or whether they are voluntary. 
Costs related to environmentally benign 
products and services are also included.
In 2011, Fortum’s investments in envi -
ronment and safety were a total of EUR 82 
million (2010: 91 million). The investments 
were mainly related to air pollution pre -
vention, waste management, and health 
and safety. Operating costs related to the 
environment, health and safety were EUR 89 million (2010: 60 million). The costs 
include, e.g., use and maintenance of 
environmental protection equipment and systems, emissions and environmental 
monitoring, decontamination of polluted 
soil, maintaining and developing biodi -
versity, development of EHS management 
systems, research and development work 
related to improving the management of environmental impacts, and the necessary 
environmental impact assessment reports 
and permit applications.
The figures are illustrative, because 
the calculation principles for EHS 
expenses and investments are not yet 
completely uniform throughout Fortum. In 2011, guidelines for the accounting and 
reporting of EHS costs were developed in 
order to clarify the EHS cost categories, the evaluation of EHS investments and the 
estimation of costs of own work. Guide -
lines will be applied in full from 2012 
onwards.
environmental liabilities
Environmental liabilities in relation to past operations relate to the dismantling 
of buildings and structures on contami -
nated land. The main part of the provision is estimated to be used within ten years. In 2011, the provisions for any future reme -
dial costs concerning environmental dam -
age amounted to a total of EUR 12 million.
In 2011, Fortum finalised soil reme -
diation projects in Imatra and Hausjärvi, Finland. Both cases included the clean-up 
of old dumping areas for municipal waste. The final approval from environmental 
authorities is still pending. Costs in 2011 
were about 30,000 euros, but the total cost of remediation at these sites was over 
500,000 euros. Small-scale soil investiga -
tions and remediations were implemented 
also in Lithuania and Sweden.
Fortum has a shared dam liability 
insurance program in place that covers Swedish dam failures up to SEK 9,000 
million.

management approach
Labour practices
Fortum’s approach to sustainability man -
agement is discussed on pages 28–29 and 
on sustainability governance on pages 
91–93.  Policy and related instructions 
to guide labour practices and Human 
resources (HR) management include: 
Code of Conduct and Human resources (HR) policy based on Fortum’s values and 
on the international declarations and 
conventions Fortum endorses. The differ -
ent subareas of the HR policy have been 
defined in more detail in Group-level, 
division or country-specific instructions. The implementation of the policy is moni -
tored through employee surveys, annual performance and development reviews as well as other feedback channels. The 
Senior Vice President, Corporate HR, is 
a member of the Fortum Management Team.
The focus areas of Fortum’s HR man -
agement for 2010–2012 include: develop -
ment of Fortum’s leadership and culture, 
development and harmonisation of people 
processes in all countries of operation, enhancement of competence and resource 
planning, improvement of employer 
image, and talent and successor planning.
Fortum aims to create attractive 
career and development opportunities for individuals to continuously grow their professional skills and know-how. Person -
nel development is supported through annual performance and development reviews, personnel training and internal 
job rotation. 
Employer image development is 
monitored through employer image sur -
veys and induction programme feedback 
surveys. In 2011, Fortum was ranked among the top-ten ideal employers in Fin -
land. Among technical students, Fortum ranked the eighth most ideal employer in Finland (2010: 6th) and 26th in Sweden 
(2010: 34th).
Fortum respects and supports the 
fundamental human and labour rights as defined by the United Nations Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the core conventions of the International Labour 
Organisation. Fortum values diversity and 
fosters fair treatment and equal opportu -
nity in recruitment, remuneration, devel -
opment and advancement of employees regardless of race, religion, political opin -
ion, gender, age, national origin, language, 
sexual orientation, marital status and 
disability. 
occupational health and safety
Fortum’s safety management is based on laws and regulations. Instructions 
guiding safety management include 
Fortum’s safety principles, Group-level safety guidelines and EHS require-
ments, supplemented with division- and 
site-specific instructions. In reporting injuries, Fortum complies with the prin -
ciples of the United States Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) 
and the ILO’s Practice on Recording and 
Notification of Occupational Accidents and Diseases (1995) to the extent that they 
conform with the legislation in Fortum’s 
countries of operation.  
Fortum’s line management is respon -
sible for safety management, and safety 
performance is a part of Fortum’s incen -
tive system. In 2011, the incentive system 
was harmonised in order to improve per -
formance; accident frequencies, number 
of fires, leaks and other deviations were 
included as main elements in defining the 
incentive pay-ratio.
Eu16 policies and requirements 
regarding health and safety of 
employees and employees of contractors and subcontractors
Everyday work is guided by Fortum and 
local level EHS guidelines. There are some 
20 Group-level safety instructions, such as 
instructions for contractor management, incident investigation, electrical safety, 
asbestos management, EHS integration 
of newly acquired companies, EHS issues in change management, work permit 
system requirements and risk assessment 
practices. Additionally, there are common minimum requirements also for EHS 
meetings, personal protective equipment 
and high risk works. Local organisations address their relevant safety issues, such as nuclear power plant safety and dam safety in more detail.
Certified safety management
Fortum’s target is to certify all its opera -
tions according to OHSAS 18001. At the 
end of 2011, 60% of Fortum’s operations 
were OHSAS 18001 certified (2010: 27%). Certification covered Power Division’s 
operations, excluding the operation and 
maintenance activities of Sullom Voe in Great Britain. In the Heat Division, certi -
fication covers all operations except some parts of the Estonian and Latvian opera -
tions. In 2011, Heat Division’s operations 
in Pärnu in Estonia received certification 
as well as Heat Scandinavia’s operations in Sweden. In January 2012, Fortum Jel -
gava representing 95% of the operations in Latvia were certified. The goal is to get certification for the Russia Division’s 
operations during 2012. The Electricity 
Solutions and Distribution (ESD) Division does not have OHSAS 18001 certification.  
Certification coverage by country is pre -
sented on page  4.
Safety targets and performance
Fortum is developing safety management and target-setting based on a principle 
of continuous improvement. Fortum has 
defined one Group-level safety target: a lost workday injury frequency of less than 
one (LWIF <1) per million working hours fortum S uStAINABILIt Y report 2011  GrI CoNteNt INDeX 111   for Fortum’s own personnel. In addi -
tion, all divisions have shared targets for 
contractor LWIF, total recordable injury 
frequency for own personnel, fires, leaks, the number of safety observation tours 
made by managers, safety reporting, and 
implementation of corrective measures.
Additionally, some key areas are 
selected annually as focus areas based 
on performance evaluations. Group-wide safety management focus areas in 2012 
are: the further reduction of serious 
accidents, enhancement of process and electrical safety management systems, 
full implementation of the Group-level 
minimum EHS requirements, roll-out of a new incident management system, and 
precise implementation of the agreed 
development programmes and actions.
The realisation of safety targets is 
monitored through monthly, quarterly and annual reporting.
Human rights
Fortum’s approach on human rights is described in the Fortum Code of Conduct, 
Supplier Code of Conduct and Human 
Resources policy. Fortum endorses the human and labour rights as defined in 
the UN Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, and the key conventions of the 
International Labour Organisation. For -
tum has also signed the United Nations 
Global Compact initiative and has been a 
registered member since 30 June 2010.
Supply chain
Sustainability is an integral part of For -
tum’s supplier selection. Fortum wants to conduct business with viable companies 
that act responsibly and comply with For -
tum’s Supplier Code of Conduct.  
Fortum’s Supplier Code of Conduct 
provides the basic sustainability guid -ance on what is expected from suppliers of services and goods. It is based on the ten 
principles of the United Nations Global 
Compact and is divided into four sections: business practices, human rights, labour 
standards and the environment.
In 2011, some 75% of the services and 
goods purchased by Fortum were procured from goods suppliers operating in Europe. 
Fuel purchases represented 35% of the total volume, out of which about half originated 
from risk countries. In risk country clas -
sification  Fortum utilises the assessments 
of ILO Decent Work Agenda, Human Development Index of the United Nations 
and the Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International.
Fortum revised its monitoring methods 
for suppliers of services and goods in 2011. 
Implementation of these revised monitor -
ing methods is a key action item for 2012. A 
rule calling for supplier screening and the 
attachment of the Supplier Code of Conduct 
to any procurement agreement exceeding 50,000 euros is applied. Screening includes 
a supplier questionnaire and verification of 
credit. The supplier questionnaire is used to gather general and sustainability informa -
tion about suppliers, and it helps suppliers to understand Fortum’s expectations for conformance with the Supplier Code of 
Conduct. On the other hand, the supplier 
questionnaire helps Fortum to identify potential risk suppliers and thus the need 
for further actions. 
Society
The Fortum Code of Conduct guides our 
management approach to society. Fortum 
follows good business practices in all of its 
operations. We compete fairly and ethi -
cally and work within the framework of 
applicable competition laws and Fortum’s 
Competition Guide. We avoid all situations where our own personal interest may conflict with the interest of the Fortum 
Group. We base our customer relations on 
honesty and trust. We treat our suppliers and subcontractors fairly and equally and 
choose them based on merit, and with the 
expectation that they will consistently comply with our requirements. In all rela -
tionships with customers and suppliers, we comply with Fortum’s guidelines and ethical principles. Notably, we never accept 
or give a bribe or other improper payment 
for any reason. As an active corporate citizen, Fortum offers expert advice to 
decision makers and non-governmental 
organisations in energy-related issues. Fortum as a company does not support, 
directly or indirectly, any political parties 
or other political organisations. Nor does it participate in financing election campaign 
for any candidates. Through our busi -
ness, Fortum interacts with millions of 
people in different ways. According to our 
Sustainability Policy, we want to develop 
our operations in co-operation with our stakeholders. Open, honest and proac -
tive communication and listening to our stakeholders are of key importance when targeting our strategic aim of becoming 
the energy supplier of choice. Special 
attention is paid to the local communities 
and people around our production plants. 
Eu19 stakeholder participation 
in the decision-making process 
related to energy planning and infrastructure development  
Fortum engages in an active dialogue 
about key issues in the energy sector 
and is involved in different associations 
and organisations at the EU level and in countries where it operates. Stakeholder 
participation in the decision-making 
process related to energy planning and infrastructure development is discussed

Fortum’s Operational Risk Management 
Instructions require our businesses to have 
solid business continuity plans in place. 
Corporate Security is responsible for crisis management development and Corporate 
Communications is responsible for crisis 
communication. Crisis management is the responsibility of the respective division and 
line organisation. Testing and updating 
plans is the responsibility of the respective units. During 2012 there is an initiative led 
by Corporate Risk Management to ensure 
dialogue regarding end-to-end plans cover -
ing more than one unit or function.
product responsibility
Fortum’s products are electricity, heating and cooling energy.  Sustainability aspects 
relating to electricity and heat production 
are discussed comprehensively in other sections of  this report. Electricity itself 
does not pose environmental, health or 
safety risks, but a risk may arise when electricity is being used. Relevant product 
responsibility aspects to Fortum include 
product quality, reliability of electricity and heat distribution, customer service and 
customer privacy. Fortum is under a duty 
to compensate damages suffered by a cus -
tomer due to fault or delay in accordance 
with the Electricity Market Act and the 
terms of customer agreements. As regards damages caused by electricity, as an owner 
of the electricity grid, Fortum is subject to 
strict liability, not dependent on negligence. 
Fortum’s electricity is to a large extent 
sold as environmentally labelled product. A 
guarantee of origin ensures that environ -
mentally labelled electricity is produced 112 GrI CoNteNt INDeX fortum  SuStAINABILIt Y report  2011from renewable energy sources according 
to Directive 2001/77/EC. Verification is 
done at production plant level on a yearly 
basis by an external auditor. Informa -
tion on Fortum’s electricity products and prices can be found at: www.fortum.com.
Reliability of power and heat distri -
bution is monitored regularly. Fortum’s efforts to continuously improve the 
reliability of electricity distribution are 
described on pages 75–76. 
Fortum provides a variety of channels 
for customers to contact and request infor -
mation, e.g., national toll-free telephone services during working hours, 24/7 feed -
back channel via internet and social media 
networks like Facebook and Twitter. SMS 
text message service has been launched in early 2012 to inform customers immedi -
ately about power outages. Our customer service function collects continuously immediate customer feedback after solv -
ing various customer errands. 
Unbundling training is given regularly 
to employees working in electricity dis -
tribution and sales to ensure high level of customer privacy in electricity business.

rate of employee turnover  
In 2011, an average of 11,010 employees 
(2010: 11,156) worked at Fortum. The big -
gest number of employees was in Russia, 4,432 employees on average. Subcontrac -tor employees worked at Fortum sites for a total of approximately 1,769,000 days during the year. The figure is based on the 
job cost estimates and the average hourly 
rates. The figure has been calculated on the basis of an 8-hour day. 
The number of Fortum’s permanent 
employees on 31 December 2011 was 10,379 (2010: 10,307), i.e., 96.3% (2010: 
97.4%). The number of full-time employees 
was 10,109 and part-time 270. The per -
centage of fixed-term employees was 3.7% 
(2010: 2.6%). 
During the year, 1,230 (2010: 1,052) 
new employees joined Fortum and 1,427 (2010: 1,954) employment relationships 
were terminated. Divestments reduced the number of personnel by a total of 122 (2010: 344). There were 47 (2010: 62) employees on international assignment. Departure turnover in 2011 was 13.7%.
Eu18 percentage of contractor 
and subcontractor employees 
that have undergone relevant health and safety training 
The Safety of contractors’ employees is as 
important as the safety of Fortum’s own 
employees. Contractor safety targets are 
set based on a continuous improvement principle, safety KPIs are measured, and 
accidents are investigated. Fortum is com -
mitted to contractor safety in all aspects 
of contractor management from contrac -
tor selection and job performance to the post-performance contractor evaluation. Corporate-level safety instruction and 
purchasing organisation’s instructions set 
the requirements.
One of the key elements in the instruc -
tions is the requirement to provide proper induction training and on-site orientation to all workers, including contractors, 
before starting the work. Efficient induc -
tion training ensures a good understand -
ing of site-specific risks, procedures and safety requirements. Induction training 
is valid for a limited period, typically, not more than three years. Induction train -ing include s at least site-specific safety 
requirements, rules, instructions, work permit procedures, the main risks of the site and how to prepare for them, required 
personnel protective equipment, near-
miss and incident reporting, emergency response, inspections, housekeeping, fire 
protection, first-aid system, evacuation 
plans, and the individuals responsible for these tasks. Verification that the safety 
procedures and requirements given in 
the induction training are understood is ensured by using interpreters, when 
needed, and by testing. All of these 
requirements cover all types of contrac -
tors and subcontractors. Implementation 
of the training is the responsibility of the 
local organisations.
la3 Employee benefits for 
full-time employees  
Employee benefits vary between Fortum’s operating countries and are in compliance 
with local legislation. Benefits include, for 
example, occupational health care, long 
service awards, and recreational and lei -
sure activities. In 2011, 296 employees had 
company car benefits.
Fortum encourages its employees to 
exercise and to enjoy culture. In Finland and Sweden, Fortum employees can join different personnel clubs offering 
sports-, nature- and arts-related activities. 
These benefits are mainly for permanent employees. In 2011, Fortum’s support 
for employees recreational and leisure 
activities in Finland was EUR 416,000. The support in Finland included clubs, 
fitness and culture vouchers, and activi -
ties related to holiday homes. In Sweden, 
the support for clubs was EUR 120,203. In 
Russia, employees recreational and leisure 
activities focused on organised family and sports days; these activities received EUR 
148,500 in 2011.FoRTUm’S pERSoNNEl STATISTICS FRom 2011, By CoUNTR y oF op ERATI oN pErsonn El by di Vision, 31 d Ec.

Remuneration at Fortum is directed by 
the Group’s remuneration principles and 
Fortum’s general remuneration and benefits 
practices. Remuneration in 2011 is discussed on pages 124–127 of the Financials 2011.
Fortum’s short-term incentive scheme, 
i.e., bonus system, supports the realisa -
tion of the Group’s financial performance targets, sustainability targets, values and structural changes. The system ensures 
that the performance targets of individual 
employees align with the targets of their respective division and the Group. All 
Fortum employees, with the exception of 
certain personnel groups in Poland and Russia, are covered by the bonus system.
In 2011, a total of 151 employees retired 
from Fortum. The figure includes age-related, early and disability retirements. 
Pension arrangements are covered under 
indicator EC3.  
labour/management relations
Collaboration between employees and For -
tum management is based on local legisla -
tion and the Code of Conduct. In Finland, 
Fortum’s employee representation system 
is site- and company-specific, and repre -
sentatives are selected by personnel groups. 
Group collaboration meetings in Finland 
are held at least twice a year in conjunction with the Group’s financial statements and 
interim reports.
In Sweden, the system is fundamentally 
identical. Collaboration between person -
nel representatives and Fortum manage -
ment in Sweden takes place in the Council 
(Sverigerådet) that convenes twice a year. 
The collaboration forms are based on the 
agreement made between the company and personnel representatives.  
In Estonia, the Working Council con -
vened four times during 2011. The Working Council meets on an as-needed basis.In other countries of operation, collab -
oration is being implemented in Councils between personnel representatives and employer representatives. Councils meet 
either regularly or on an as-needed basis.
As a rule, the Fortum European Coun -
cil (FEC) convenes once a year. In May 2011, it had participants from Finland, 
Sweden, Poland, Estonia and Norway. Issues on the Council’s agenda include the 
Group’s financial statements, strategy and 
amendments, future outlook for Group production, employment, productivity and 
cost structure, and other fundamental 
changes taking place in the operations, as well as general issues related to the com -
pany’s practices. In 2011, the FEC mem -
bers participated in the revision work of the Fortum Code of Conduct.
la4 coverage of collective 
bargaining agreements
Fortum respects its employees’ freedom of association and collective bargaining, but 
does not monitor the degree of unionisa -
tion of its employees. Fortum applies local 
collective bargaining agreements in all 
countries where it operates, in compliance 
with the scope of each respective agree -
ment.
la5 minimum notice period 
regarding operational changes
In situations of organisational restructur -
ing, Fortum negotiates with personnel 
representatives in compliance with each 
country’s local legislation and contractual procedures. The minimum notice period 
is based on local legislation, collective 
agreements or employment contracts, which are in harmony with local legisla -
tion and agreements. In situations involv -
ing personnel reductions, Fortum aims primarily to support the re-employment 
of its personnel. occupational health and safety
lA6 Representation in joint 
health and safety committees 
Fortum’s occupational health care is 
organised in all countries of operation in 
accordance with local laws and regulations. 
Workplace well-being and work safety are regularly addressed also in occupational 
safety committees, which operate in line 
with local legislative requirements and represent all personnel groups. 
lA7 Rates of injury, occupational 
diseases, lost days, fatalities 
and absenteeism
Fortum’s performance in occupational 
safety for its own personnel improved 
clearly in 2011, although the LWIF target 
was not reached. The LWIF for Fortum’s own personnel decreased to 1.6 (2010: 2.4). 
The result was Fortum’s all-time best. For -
tum’s target is to avoid fatalities and acci -
dents with serious injuries. In 2011, there was one fatal accident for our contractor, 
and the total number of serious accidents to Fortum personnel and contractors was 
11 and decreased slightly (2010: 13). There was an improvement in other 
performance indicators as well: the num -
ber of accidents resulting in an absence dropped from 45 to 29. However, person -
nel absences resulting from work injuries 
increased to 1,134 days (2010: 769) due to 
some long-term sick leaves. Fortum per -
sonnel’s total recordable injury frequency 
(TRIF), which includes also minor injuries 
that do not lead to an absence, improved 
from 4.6 in 2010 to 3.5 in 2011.
Fortum’s safety management equally 
encompasses contractors working at Fortum sites. A clear improvement was achieved also in contractor accident 
frequency; the LWIF for contractors 
decreased from 5.0 to 3.2. The good safety performance continued in ongoing, large

in Russia 30,993 and in Poland 9,606. In 
2010, the sickness absence days were col -
lected only for Finland and Sweden, 9,281 
days in total. The significant increase in 
the number of sickness absences in Fin -
land and Sweden from 2010 to 2011 was 
due to the  more specific notice practices and more accurate recording systems. In 
Poland, the figures may suffer from inac -
curancies as the compilation of sickness 
absence data was not in full compliance 
with the definition. Fortum’s goal is to 
decrease the sickness absence rate in the long term by monitoring, investigating 
and eliminating the causes of sickness-
related absences. 
In 2011, there were 8 (2010:13) cases 
of occupational diseases. Four cases were still under review at the end of the year and four were determined as not entitled 
to compensation. Suspected occupational 
diseases are related mainly to noise and possible exposure to asbestos.
A good performance was achieved also 
in most of the process safety indicators. 
There were no INES > 0 incidents at the 
Loviisa nuclear power plant and no dam safety incidents. However, the number 
of fires remained at the same level as in 
2010. The reduction of fires will be of spe -
cial focus in 2012.
la8 Education and counselling 
to assist workforce members 
regarding serious diseases  
Fortum’s occupational health care service 
emphasises the significance of preventive 
activities in promoting well-being in the 
company as well as employee counsel -
ling for work-related or serious illnesses. 
Occupational health care participates in 
various discussions and assessments in the work community. The occupational 
health care professionals also support 
management by providing information on preventive actions as well as alternatives when the ability to work decreases. They 
also offer methods and tools for these 
actions. 
In 2011, an average of 2,700 (2010: 
2,700) employees in Finland were within the sphere of Fortum’s occupational health care. About 80% (2010: 75%) of them 
used the company’s own occupational 
health care services and about 20% (2010: 25%) used contracted health clinics. The 
total costs of Fortum’s own occupational 
health care in Finland were about EUR 1.2 million (2010: 1.1 million). The occu -
pational health care costs per person, calculated from the share paid by Fortum, were EUR 560 (2010: 501) in Finland and 
EUR 92 (2010: 99) in Sweden.
Fortum covers all Swedish, Norwegian, 
Polish and German employees’ occupa -
tional health care as required by law. In 
Russia, employees are within the sphere of a medical expenses insurance plan and can 
use private medical services. Also each pro -
duction plant in Russia has a healthcare 
station with nursing-level first-aid services. 
Training and education
la11 programmes for skills 
management and lifelong learning 
Fortum offers its employees several internal training programmes to support 
the various development needs. During 
the first half of 2011, Fortum conducted two different types of leadership train -
ing programmes, Fortum Manager and Fortum Expert. The Fortum Manager training programme is designed for all 
supervisors in need of basic skills related 
to daily management. The Fortum Expert programme is tailored to the experts’ 
needs in managerial, communication and 
collaboration skills. In addition, Fortum has the Fortum Master training courses, 
which aim to improve manager readiness in everyday tasks related to leadership and 
development. The courses also support the 
Fortum way of carrying out HR practices. 
The Master training consists of one-day courses, and all the course modules are 
independent. In addition to Finland and 
Sweden, some of the Master courses were organised also in the Baltic countries and 
Poland. In 2011, a total of 347 participants 
attended the courses, and the number of Master training days totalled 38.
Fortum Forerunner is a trainee 
programme meant for recent university graduates. During the 18-month-long pro -
gramme, trainees have the opportunity to work at variable assignments in dif -
ferent business environments and to get 
acquainted with Fortum’s operations and 
the energy industry. The current trainee programme started in January 2011, and 
the trainees are from Finland, Sweden, 
Russia, Poland and Latvia.
Additionally, new employees par -
ticipate in a standard introduction programme, Fortum Passport. The pro-gramme also includes a feedback survey 
conducted four months after the start of 
employment. The survey is used to moni -
tor the implementation of the programme 
and to develop its content. Fortum’s Leading Performance and 
Growth initiative and Leadership Impact programme are discussed on pages 78-80.
la12 Employees receiving 
regular performance and career 
development reviews
Fortum employees in all operating 
countries  are in the scope of the per -
formance and development discussion process. However, the scope varies from individual level to team level reviews. The 
annual performance and development 
reviews aim to commit and motivate employees, engage them in the strategy, 
business goals and operating plans, and 
improve operational planning, the work -
place atmosphere and the flow of informa -
tion. 
Personal or team goals are set in the 
performance and development reviews. 
The achievement of these goals is linked 
to the employee’s incentive bonus. With the exception of the employees of recently 
acquired businesses, the permanent 
employees at Fortum are included in the incentive programme. The aim, however, 
is to gradually implement a Fortum-wide 
performance and development model also at new Fortum sites.
Equal opportunities

The average age of Fortum’s perma -
nent employees in 2011 was 41 years (2010: 44), and the share of employees over 
50 years was 30% (2010: 36%).
In 2011, women accounted for 29% 
(2010: 29%) of Fortum’s total personnel. Women accounted for 34% (2010: 27%) of 
the Group- and division-level manage -
ment teams. In 2011, the Board of Direc -
tors comprised seven members, three including the chairman were women. 
la14 ratio of basic salary of men to 
women by employee category 
In line with its HR policy, Fortum offers all its employees a competitive incentive sys -
tem. Salaries and wages are based on laws and agreements, and are compliant with established practices in each country. Sal -
ary levels are based on personal work per -
formance, job size, competence grade, and on defined competence requirements. The 
market situation also has an impact on the 
salary level. In Finland, the pay equality for men and women in white- and upper-
white-collar positions has been monitored since 2005. Comparisons in the ‘workers’ 
personnel group have not been possible 
due to the small group sizes. In 2011 the 
salary differences between male and female white-collar employees was just 
under 7 percentage points, on average, and 
the dispersion was 3–14 percentage points. The differences are partly explained by 
age and seniority differences. Similar dif -
ferences in salaries were not observed in 
the upper-white-collar employee group 
for either gender. Similar studies have not 
been made in other countries.
Human rights

A sustainability assessment is carried out for all Fortum’s investment projects 
and takes into consideration the envi -
ronmental, occupational health and 
safety and social impacts of the project. 
Projects requiring approval by the For -
tum Management Team are subject to an 
assessment and approval by Group-level 
sustainability experts. 
In 2011, the investment proposals 
requiring FMT approval did not include human rights assessment. During 2011, 
Fortum revised the instructions on invest -
ment assessment to also include human 
rights evaluation.
hr2 suppliers and contractors that have 
undergone human rights screening 
Fortum’s Supplier Code of Conduct is 
implemented in all Fortum’s operating 
countries and it is included in all purchas -
ing agreements exceeding 50,000 euros. 
However, the number of suppliers subject 
to supplier screening and auditing was 
not available in 2011. Fortum’s target is to start publishing this data in 2013.hr3 human rights-related 
training for employees 
In 2011, the key purchasing personnel and project managers in Finland, the Baltic 
countries, Poland and Sweden, 130 people 
in all, were trained to use the revised sup -
plier pre-selection questionnaire and the 
new evaluation form.
In addition to the training mentioned 
above, the internal competence build-up for conducting the Supplier Code of 
Conduct audits was also started in 2011. Auditor candidates from Finland, Poland 
and Sweden received 1.5 days of internal 
training on the requirements of the Sup -
plier Code of Conduct and on how to audit 
against the requirements, the elements 
of the audit and the tools to be used. Supplier Code of Conduct audits will be 
started in 2012 with the target to audit 
three main risk country suppliers per division.
non-discrimination
hr4 incidents of discrimination and 
actions taken   
The equal and fair treatment of employees is a cornerstone of well-being and 
working capacity. The principles of equal 
treatment are included in Fortum’s HR policy and Code of Conduct, which 
are followed in all countries in which 
Fortum operates. Fortum promotes equal treatment and opportunities in 
recruiting, remuneration, development 
and career advancement, regardless of the employee’s race, religion, political 
views, gender, age, nationality, language, 
sexual orientation, marital status or disabilities. Any form of harassment is 
forbidden and addressed immediately. In 
Finland and Sweden, Fortum has separate guidelines for workplace harassment 
and discrimination. In 2011, there were 
no cases of discrimination reported.Freedom of association and

so3 anti-corruption training
Fortum’s anti-corruption principles have been included in the Fortum Code of Con -
duct since 2007 with all Fortum employ -ees participating in the Code of Conduct training.  The revision of the Fortum Code of Conduct began in 2011, see page 29. In 
that connection the revised anti-bribery and conflict of interest instructions were approved by the Fortum Management 
Team. The Group-wide roll-out of the 
revised Code of Conduct and the new busi -
ness ethics instructions, including the 
revised anti-bribery and conflict of inter -
est instructions, will take place in 2012.
The Fortum Code of Conduct e-learn -
ing tool will have a key role in the roll-out, 
and every Fortum employee is expected to pass the training through the e-learning 
tool. The material will be published in 10 
different languages.
so4 actions taken in response 
to incidents of corruption 
Fortum has always had a strong focus in the prevention of any type of corruption. 
In connection with the revised Fortum 
Code of Conduct, Fortum has reviewed its procedures to ensure the prevention, 
oversight, reporting and enforcement 
based on the requirements prescribed in international legislation. For appropriate 
business ethics compliance management, 
Fortum ensures and arranges:• continuous training and 
communication
• procedures and reporting 
• appropriate controls
• line management has always the 
primary responsibility for ensuring compliance
• compliance risks assessment is periodic and documented with the Fortum Management Team having oversight 
of the process;  a systematic risk 
assessment is included in business plans, and follow-up is part of the 
business performance review.  Line management regularly reports on 
compliance activities to the Fortum Man -
agement Team, including the President 
and CEO. The Audit and Risk Committee annually receives a report on compliance 
activities. The Fortum Code of Conduct 
and compliance topics and instructions are communicated through internal and 
external communication channels. The 
communication is made applying the tone from the top management principle and 
following the principles of transparency 
in sustainability reporting. 
However, if incidents of corruption 
occur, Fortum has internal procedures to 
deal with the incident professionally, in 
accordance with applicable  laws and with respect to the rights and personal integ -
rity of the persons and parties involved. Thus, each incident will be first properly investigated, including a hearing of the 
relevant persons and parties, and then 
the appropriate sanctions and corrective actions, if deemed necessary, will be con -
sidered. Furthermore, after each incident an assessment is made regarding  the need to raise awareness of the Fortum Code of 
Conduct is considered. This can be done 
through e.g., e-learning or face-to-face training, in the relevant business organ -
isation to ensure that employees are fully aware of what is considered appropriate conduct at Fortum and what their respon -
sibility is in case of non-compliance.

various organisations. Fortum engages 
in an active dialogue about key issues in the energy sector and publishes position 
papers on significant topics. In 2011, For -
tum has published country specific energy policy reviews regarding Finland, Sweden and Poland. Read more at www.fortum.

In December 2011, Fortum registered 
to the joint transparency register set up and operated by the European Parlia -
ment and the European Commission. The 
register provides parties with informa -
tion about persons engaged in activities aiming at influencing the EU decision-making process, which interests are being

Fortum’s products are electricity, heating 
and cooling energy.  Electricity itself does 
not pose environmental, health or safety 
risks, but a risk may arise when electricity 
is being used. Relevant product responsi -

quality, reliability of electricity and heat 
distribution, customer service and cus -

Fortum uses international indicators 
(SAIDI and CAIDI) to measure electric -
ity distribution reliability. In 2011,  the 
system average interruption duration indicator (SAIDI) per customer was 565 
minutes (2010: 104). The customer average 
interruption duration indicator (CAIDI) was 240 minutes (2010: 62). The increased  interruption durations were due to the 
severe Christmas storms in Finland and 
Sweden.  
product and service labelling
pr3 product information 
required by procedures 
Fortum follows EU-based national leg -
islation on the origin of electricity. This 
requires the electricity producer to report 
the origin of the produced electricity, the CO
2 emissions and the amount of radioac -
tive waste. In 2010, Fortum Markets Oy 
sold electricity to residential and business 
customers. Electricity was acquired from Nord Pool. Residential customers in Fin -
land received 100% hydro or wind power. In Sweden customers can choose between electricity produced with nuclear, hydro or wind power. In Norway customers 
are offered CO
2 -free product produced 
with 100% renewable energy. Nuclear and hydropower was delivered mainly to busi -
ness customers. In addition, Fortum Mar -
kets has long-term electricity contracts with  large business customers, which 
received so called mixed electricity.  
The origin of sold electricity in 2010 was: 
• 42.5% renewable energy (34.5% was sold 
as environmental electricity) 
• 49% nuclear power
• 8.5% fossil fuels
Emissions from the produced electricity:
• Accumulation of used nuclear fuel: 1,449 mg/kWh 
• Carbon dioxide (CO
2): 62 g CO 2/kWh.
Due to the finalisation of the Nordic 
statistics  figures for 2011 will be available 
in summer 2012. 
pr5 customer satisfaction  
Fortum monitors the satisfaction and loyalty of private and business 
electricity customers through regular 
EPSI customer satisfaction surveys in Finland, Sweden and Norway. In 2011, 
Fortum reached its all-time best score 
in the annual EPSI rating in Finland. At the same time, the average scores 
of the other large energy companies 
and the industry dropped. Looking at different factors, Fortum received 
the best score in Finland in product 
quality, and, in Sweden and Norway, in meeting customer expectations. In 
Finland and Sweden, Fortum received 
the lowest scores in customer loyalty and, in Norway, in price value. 
At the end of 2010 and beginning of 
2011, Fortum developed a new common stakeholder and customer satisfaction 
survey - the One Fortum survey. The 
survey aims to bring all Fortum’s stake -holders and divisions under the same umbrella and to measure Fortum’s repu -
tation and customer satisfaction in a uni -
fied way throughout the organisation. The One Fortum survey replaced many previ -
ously separate reputation and customer satisfaction surveys. The survey covers 
several stakeholder groups, including 
customers, governmental bodies, capital markets, non-governmental organisations 
and Fortum’s personnel. In Finland and 
Sweden, the survey covers also the general public. 
The survey was conducted for the first 
time in spring 2011 in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Poland, the Baltic countries and 
Russia. For the Power Division, the survey 
also covered customers in other countries,  such as Germany and Great Britain. 
The results of the One Fortum survey 
are reviewed by top management at For -
tum and utilised in business planning 
throughout the organisation, both in the 
divisions and in the corporate functions. 
The severe Christmas storms in 
Finland and Sweden and the widespread 
and long power outages are expected to 
influence Fortum’s customer satisfaction index.  Fortum is working determinedly 
to raise the customer satisfaction and 
loyalty back to the level before the year end 2011.  
marketing communication

marketing communications 
regulations and voluntary codes  
Finland’s Energy Market Authority 
required Fortum Markets Oy to take 
actions to correct its procedure in viola -
tion of the Decree on Verification and 
Notification of Origin of Electricity. 
According to the regulation, the sales 
promotion material regarding 100% hydropower was missing the notifica -tion on electricity stock exchange or the amount of electricity purchased outside 
the European economic area in relation to 
the total amount of electricity sold. For -
tum Markets Oy has performed corrective 
actions and has reported those to Energy 
Market Authority. This non-compliance 
case took place in autumn 2010 and the 
Energy Market Authority gave its decision in March 2011.
In Sweden, Fortum Power and Heat 
AB received a judgment from the adver -
tisement ombudsman about misleading 
advertising in violation of the article 5 
of International Chamber of Commerce regarding advertising and communica -
tion. The advertisement concerned Bra Miljöval, which is a label for electricity produced from renewable energy sources.

Fortum c orporation
We have performed a limited assurance 
engagement on the Fortum Corporate 
Sustainability report for the reporting 
period of January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011.
management’s responsibility
Management is responsible for the prepa -
ration of the Corporate Sustainability 
report in conformity with the Sustain -
ability Reporting Guidelines (G3.1) of the 
Global Reporting Initiative and principles 
of inclusivity, materiality and responsive -
ness as set out in the AA1000 Account -
Ability Principles. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and 
maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of 
the Corporate sustainability report that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, selecting 
and applying appropriate criteria and 
making estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. The scope of the 2011 
Fortum Corporate Sustainability report 
and the information included therein depends on the Fortum’s Corporate Sus -
tainability priority areas as well as the reporting policies applied which are set out on page 91–96 of the Corporate Sus -
tainability report.Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to draw a moder -
ate assurance conclusion on the Fortum 
Corporate Sustainability report based 
on our engagement. We conducted our engagement in accordance with Inter -
national Assurance Standard ISAE3000. In addition, we have used the criteria in AA1000AS (2008) to evaluate adherence 
AA1000APS (2008) for type 1 assurance 
engagement. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the engagement to obtain limited 
assurance about whether the Fortum’s Corporate Sustainability report is free of 
material misstatement.
We did not perform any assurance 
procedures on the prospective informa -
tion, such as targets, expectations and 
ambitions, disclosed in the Corporate Sustainability report. Consequently, we 
draw no conclusion on the prospective 
information.
A limited assurance engagement with 
respect to a Corporate Sustainability report involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the information 
disclosed in the Corporate Sustainabil -
ity report. The procedures performed 
depend on the practitioner’s judgment, 
but their nature is different from, and 
their extent is substantially less than, a reasonable assurance engagement. 
It does not include detailed testing of source data or the operating effective -
ness of processes and internal controls 
and consequently they do not enable us to obtain the assurance necessary to 
become aware of all significant matters 
that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement. 
Our procedures on this engagement 
included:• Review of the processes and systems 
for data gathering, amongst others the 
aggregation of the data as included in the Corporate Sustainability report;
• Assessing the suitability of the reporting policies used by management and the consistent application such 
policies, including assessing of the 
suitability of the reporting criteria, the inclusiveness of the responses 
on the stakeholder dialogue and the 
overall presentation in the Corporate Sustainability report;
• Conducting interviews with senior management responsible for Corporate Sustainability at Fortum;
• Performing analytical review procedures;
• Inspecting internal and external 
documentation and verifying to what 
extent these documents and data support the information included in 
the Corporate Sustainability report;
• Evaluating whether the information 
presented in the Corporate 
Sustainability report is in line with our overall knowledge of Corporate 
Sustainability at Fortum.
• Site visits to selected sites in Poland and Russia to review compliance to reporting policies and review the 
process of reporting;
• Evaluating the application of the 
AA1000APS principles;
• Assessing the Company’s stated application level according to GRI’s guidelines; 
We believe that the evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our conclusion.
observations & 
recommendations
Based on our moderate assurance 
engagement, we provide the following 
recommendations in relation to the 
Accountability Principles AA1000APS (2008) and GRI G3.1 principles. The recom -
mendations are to improve management and reporting of sustainability in future and do not affect our conclusion: 
• Inclusivity - Fortum has an extensive 
stakeholder inclusiveness process and throughout this process Fortum has 
identified a broad range of relevant 
key stakeholder groups. We encourage Fortum to enhance the presentation 
of the relation between Stakeholder Independent assurance reportfortum S uStAINABILIt Y report 2011  GrI CoNteNt INDeX 119   000-119dialogue, strategy and identifi  cation of 
key issues and targets.
• Materiality – Fortum has implemented a systematic process in determining what issues are important and 
material for Fortum´s stakeholders. 
We recommend that Fortum further emphasizes the presentation of this 
relation between materiality for each 
stakeholder group.
• Responsiveness – The report addresses 
well the specifi  c issues and how 
Fortum has managed and responded to those issues. We recommend 
Fortum to develop the presentation 
of the organization’s performance in accordance with the wider context of

policies which preclude us from taking 
fi  nancial, commercial, governance and 
ownership positions which might affect, or be perceived to affect, our indepen-
dence and impartiality and from any 
involvement in the preparation of the report. We have confi  rmed to Fortum that 
we have maintained our independence 
and objectivity throughout the year and in particular that there were no events or 
prohibited services provided which could 
impair our independence and objectivity.

multidisciplinary team including assur-ance and sustainability expertise with professional qualifi  cations. Our team has 
many years of experience in providing 
sustainability reporting assurance.conclusion
On the basis of the procedures we have performed nothing has come to our atten-
tion that causes us to believe the Fortum 
Corporate Sustainability report for the year from January 1, 2011 to December 
31, 2011, is not prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the Sustain-ability Reporting Guidelines (G3.1) of the 
Global Reporting Initiative and to the 
AA1000 AccountAbility Principles.
