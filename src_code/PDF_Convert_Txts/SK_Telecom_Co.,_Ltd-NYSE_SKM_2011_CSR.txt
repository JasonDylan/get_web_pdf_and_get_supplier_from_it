SK’s “Wings of Happiness” emblem represents its willingness to contribute to human-
kind’s happiness by pursuing the happiness of its stakeholders. The ‘Wings of Happiness’ 
reflect SK’s spirit of Super Excellence soaring toward the global market and express SK’s 
core values of happiness and dedication to customers, by adding the color red, which rep-
resents SK’s pride, to the color orange, which indicates happiness, warmth, and charm. Just 
as the two wings of the “Wings of Happiness” can only fly high when they are in harmony 
and balance, SK’s sustainability can only be achieved when customers, the company and 
its shareholders, management and members, and the company’s business partners are all 
mutually happy.  SK Telecom creates new value 
across industrial boundaries by 
practicing innovation on a daily 
basis, using its strong business 
infrastructure and human 
resources to make a happier and 
richer world.  Partner

Distinguished stakeholders,
In 2011, in response to the increasing number of smartphone users and the expanding market for wireless 
data, SK Telecom produced noticeable results, such as ranking first place in both cable and wireless areas 
and securing LTE leadership, and consolidated the foundation for the mobile telecommunications business. The launch of SK Planet and the acquisition of Hynix helped pave the way for the takeoff of the company’s new growth. In addition, as a result of all-employee efforts to fulfill the company’s social responsibility as a leading business, in September 2011, SK Telecom was simultaneously selected as the first Asian telecom-munications company to join the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for four consecutive years and as a leader in the global mobile telecommunications sector for two straight years. The company also  ranked first place in the top 3 customer satisfaction indices, including NCSI, for 15 years straight. 
Rather than being complacent with the status quo, in 2012, SK Telecom is embarking on a voyage toward 
new growth in order to create more sustainable future value under the banner of the newly established Vi-sion 2020. Its new vision, “Partner for New Possibilities,” represents SK Telecom’s determination to create a sustainable ICT ecosystem by creating new value beyond industrial boundaries, together with all stakehold-ers, such as customers, partners, employees, communities, shareholders, and the government.     
Under the leadership of the Corporate Citizenship Committee supervised by the Board of Directors, SK 
Telecom will increase its dedication to fulfilling its social responsibility in the areas of customer relationship management, win-win partnerships, community involvement, ethics management, and environmental management. Furthermore, as a UN Global Compact signatory, the company will listen intently to the demands of a variety of stakeholders, both domestic and overseas, and reflect the global-level demands for corporate social responsibility as set forth by ISO 26000 and the UN Global Compact Index in its  
business activities.  
For the past 27 years, SK Telecom has been leading the Korean information communication industry, and 
will continue its commitment to enriching the lives of stakeholders in diverse areas across society, as well as the telecommunications industry, and becoming a global enterprise loved by all stakeholders. 
The ongoing interest and support of our stakeholders will be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you.

SK Telecom continues its dedication to making customers happier by 
delivering reliability and customer satisfaction. By providing telecom-munications services of excellent quality and customized plans, the 
company seeks to offer customers greater quality of life. The company 
also works hard to resolve privacy risks and strengthen privacy protec-tion by limiting the collection and retention of personal information to the minimum level. 
Challenges
With the recent increase in risks relating to the abuse and leaks of 
personal information, the social monitoring of privacy policies and systems implemented by companies that need customer information, 
including those in the telecommunications industry, has also become 
stronger. In addition, as the wireless communications service has become an essential part of life, providing the best call quality and mitigating cost burdens have also arisen as principal social issues.
Goal & StrategySustainability at SK Telecom    |    Our Sustainability Leadership _ Customer Relationship Management     |    Appendix
Strict Customer Privacy Policy
Operating a system 
for stronger pri -
vacy protectionRecognizing the importance of privacy protection, since 2008, SK Telecom has been operating a 
customer privacy management system led by the CPO (Chief Privacy Officer) and CSO (Chief Secu-
rity Officer) with regard to customers’ personal information. At every stage in which personal infor -
mation is handled, including the gathering, use, and destruction of information, strict handling pro-
cedures are enforced and frequent monitoring and preliminary inspections are conducted as well. In 
addition, the company creates an internal customer privacy management plan in the beginning of 
each year, which all employees are notified about,  and implements the ‘Security and Privacy Pledge’ 
via the Intranet and employees’ personal email addresses to reinforce awareness of the importance 
of privacy protection. The company also increases the scope of management by providing online 
and offline training at least twice each year, including the Privacy Authentication System, targeting even the members of contractors who are entrusted with the handling of personal information.
Strengthening offline channels 
SK Telecom makes it mandatory for each store to provide an explanation about handling customers’ personal information in situations that require customers to submit personal information and, as a 
result of this purpose, the company conducts customer service training targeting store managers 
on a regular basis. The “Paperless Store” program, which was launched in 2011, was introduced to eliminate any possibility of information leakage, which may occur within a distribution channel. In 
this program, any series of procedures that requires personal information, from joining to cancelling membership, is conducted on a tablet PC. This allows any information that a customer enters to be directly sent to the SK Telecom server, without remaining in the store. As of late May 2012, 2,417 
paperless stores are in operation.Strengthening the

15Strengthening online channels
The company has a system under which any information collected through an online channel can 
only be collected when the customer agrees to the Consent to Information Collection. T-World, SK 
Telecom’s customer website, limits the collection of personal information for membership purposes 
to a minimum. It allows an applicant to sign up without  agreeing to the “Consent to Third-Party Use of Personal Information” so that the unnecessary sharing of personal information with an af-
filiate or an external organization is prohibited without the customer’s consent. Fundamentally, SK 
Telecom prohibits the use of personal information outside the scope notified to a customer or spec-ified in the Terms of Service and, if absolutely necessary, uses the said information only if such use 
has been notified and the customer’s prior consent, either written or by e-mail, has been obtained.  
Strengthening the privacy security infrastructure
In 2007, SK Telecom created a Security Operation Center (SOC) for data encryption and manage-
ment to protect the personal information of mobile telecommunications and other service sub-
scribers, members of a website like T-World, the company’s employees and those of affiliates. The 
SOC allows access to the customer database only through SOC admin computers, and blocks any potential hacker threats by shutting off the Internet and all networks of the admin computers. In 
addition, the company built a Security Control Center with a system for the 24/7 detection and 
response to external attacks like hacking, DDos, worms, and viruses, and provides thorough pro-tection of personal information by operating a Customer Information Transfer System, a Document 
Security System, and a Customer Log Analysis.  
Support to expand the scope of privacy security
To ensure thorough protection with regard to the takeover and security of personal information 
obtained from SK Telecom’s investment companies, SK Telecom provides immediate communica-
tion to customers regarding any changes made to the said information and enforces support poli-
cies relating to personal information for the investment companies. In 2011, the changes made to personal information in relation to the spinoff of SK Planet were notified to customers, and 
their personal information was only transferred to SK Planet after their consent was obtained. The 
company also provides support so that key investment companies can obtain Personal Information 
Management System (PIMS) certification, which is implemented by the Korea Communications 
Commission. SK Telecom will continue to create a personal information management system for 
each investment company and provide management support. Strengthening  
privacy security 
and expanding the 
scope of  
management
In May 2011, SK Telecom became the first Korean telecom company to acquire Personal Informa-
tion Management System (PIMS) certification, which is supervised by the Korea Communications 
Commission and reviewed by the Korean Internet & Security Agency. PIMS is a certificate granted 
to a company that safely manages personal information after the company is inspected to deter -
mine whether it has the protection system required to systematically and continuously carry out privacy protection activities company-wide. Acquiring Personal

an external collaboration system to protect customers against any such damage. Its efforts also 
include reducing spam damage to the underprivileged.
Introducing Anti-Spam Technology |  In 2007, the company adopted a spam filtering service for 
customers and introduced a technology that blocks spam before they receive it. The company took the lead in protecting minors against spam by granting membership to all elementary school cus-
tomers in 2009, and then youth subscribers in 2011. As of 2011, about 6 million subscribed to the 
spam filtering service, and in October 2011, automatic subscription applications were extended 
to new and existing customers as well as those applying for name changes. In addition, in 2011 
the company made improvements to the existing Voice Spam Detection and Recording systems 
to shorten the average spam consulting time to less than 1 minute and increase consulting effi-
ciency. Such efforts helped reduce the number of spam-related VOCs, which amounted from about 
160,000 in 2009, to about 59,000 by the end of 2011.
Creating External Collaboration System | SK Telecom increases spam blocking and prevention 
efficiency through the collaboration system with external agencies. In 2011, with the fast-growing use of smartphone messengers, the company created a collaborative system with the Korean In-
ternet & Security Agency (KISA) to prevent spam from major chat services, such as KakaoTalk and 
NateOnTalk. SK Telecom’s collaboration with mobile phone manufacturers, such as Samsung Elec-
tronics and LG Electronics, has helped mount an easy spam reporting system on mobile phones 
released in Korea in 2012. 
Conducting Anti-Spam Training for the Underprivileged |   Since 2008, SK Telecom has provid-
ed preventative training for North Korean refugees, who are not familiar with life in South Korea, 
regarding spam, voice phishing, and excessive rates, while also teaching them how to use mobile 
phones. Also,  in 2007, the company embarked on providing training for the elderly who are not 
familiar with IT devices to prevent them from experiencing spam-related damage. 
SK Telecom conducts security awareness activities, including pledges and training, targeted at 
employees so that personal information can be safely stored and used under a well-established 
system. In addition, the company operates the “Customer Protection Center” as an independent 
department responsible for resolving company-wide complaints in relation to the management of customer complaints received through external agencies, such as the Korea Communications 
Commission, Korea Customer Agency, and NGOs, its headquarters and contact channels. “The 
Customer Protection Center” is a control tower responsible for overseeing company-wide cus-
tomer complaints and delivering customer satisfaction through risk elimination and systematic/
process improvements in relation to complaints management. SK Telecom will continue to work 
hard to improve customer satisfaction through a strict privacy protection policy, as well as high-
quality call services.

17SK Telecom implements policies and employee training to ensure the safe destruction of personal 
information collected from customers. Except those individuals authorized to handle personal in-
formation, employees cannot store such information separately. Even in the case that it is deemed 
absolutely necessary for work purposes, they must store such information in an encrypted file and destroy it upon finishing using it. In addition, the company ensures that an application form com-
pleted by a customer will be returned to the customer immediately upon completion of processing 
and works hard to provide safe customer information management by entrusting a designated collection/destruction agency with frequent on-site shredding or receipt shredding for any docu-
ments containing personal information that must be stored for a certain period of time.
SK Telecom appoints a department from each team to be responsible for managing risks like pri-
vacy infringement, and has created a crisis management system to carry out risk management 
activities. Based on this system, the company developed a company-wide crisis response process 
to provide the promptest response to a risk as possible.Safe information

CustomerInformation Leak Response ProcessIn July 2011, Nate, a web portal operated by SK Communications, an investment company of SK 
Telecom, was hacked and the information of 35 million users was leaked. The hacking originated 
from a malicious code in China, and the leaked information contained IDs, names, mobile phone 
numbers, e-mail addresses, encrypted passwords, and resident registration numbers. However, the 
resident registration numbers and passwords remained safe because they were encrypted with the 
most advanced technology.
Upon discovery of the leakage, SK Communications sent all of its users e-mail notifications and 
employed pop-up windows on the message boards through which users could confirm the leak-
age of their personal information. It also expanded its hotline call center to prevent tier-2 damage, such as voice phishing and spam. In the aftermath of this incident, SK Telecom extended the ap-
plication of its data integration center technology to ensure the privacy protection of investment 
companies, and will help these key investment companies obtain PIMS certification, which is re-
viewed by KISA. Case Study 03

Ensuring the Best Call Quality
Building a high-
quality networkWith the distribution of smartphones and the increased use of multimedia, data traffic for SK Tele-
com customers increased 76 times between 2009 and 2011, and this trend will continue until the 
traffic increases 6 times between 2011 and 2015. In order to effectively respond to such skyrock-
eting data traffic, SK Telecom introduced SCAN (Smart Cloud Access Network) technology and ap-plied it to LTE and 3G networks to deliver perfect speed and quality. For smart network operations, 
the company developed AOM (Always On Management), which monitors KeepAlive and Push 
Message to provide SK Telecom’s customers high call quality anytime, anywhere. SK Telecom will continue to provide high-quality mobile telecommunications services by introducing a femtocell 
and a remote radio unit (RRU) to build a highly efficient network, which will enable high-capacity 
and high-speed delivery based on Smart Small Cells.Issue 2  SK Telecom is dedicated to ensuring that every single customer of 
SK Telecom can use best-quality calls and services anytime, anywhere. SK Telecom 
will continue its endeavors, such as building a high-quality data-centered network, 
extending the LTE nationwide network in 2012, improving 3G quality, and expanding communication coverage, until it can deliver calls of the utmost quality to customers. 
In July 2011, SK Telecom became the 22nd mobile telecommunications company in the world to 
commercialize 4G LTE service. In just 80 days after the commercialization, the company gained 
over 500,000 subscribers, becoming the fastest company to successfully attract the largest num-
ber of subscribers. SK’s distinguished technical excellence played the biggest role in winning cus-
tomers’ favor in such a short period of time.
Since the commercialization of LTE in July 2011, SK Telecom has worked hard to deliver perfect speed 
and quality by introducing SCAN technology. In 2012, when extending the LTE network, the company 
will make the best use of its much more advanced SCAN technology to provide customers the best 
service in terms of speed and quality. In addition, SK Telecom applies PETA, the world’s most ad-
vanced network technology, to all LTE networks. “PETA” is a general term for the world-class network 
operation technology owned by SK Telecom and represents the company’s determination to provide 
customers with the best, most distinguished network service, including “premium quality,” “excellent speed,” “total stability,” and “advanced technology,” in the upcoming petabyte era.

19Introducing technology that improves call quality
In September 2011, SK Telecom applied the W-SCAN technology, which utilizes cloud computing, 
to the 3G network and nearly doubled its speed and capacity. Since about 50% of data traffic 
nationwide arises from metropolitan areas,  the technology has been applied in stages, starting 
with the wireless traffic-concentrated areas, including Seoul, Incheon, and 15 other cities in the metro area, and will be extended to more areas.
Improving call quality based on call quality-related VOC
SK Telecom works hard to continue to develop technologies that can improve telecommunications service quality and minimize any inconvenience to customers by responding quickly to such incon-
veniences that may arise due to service quality. Once any customer complaint regarding call qual-
ity has been presented, the CS Team receives the complaint and resolves it through site visits and network quality inspections. By regularly conducting statistical analyses of customer complaints, 
the company prevents any potential complaints. 
When the call service stability was challenged due to the GPS interference in early March 2011, 
the company, under its VOC handling system, received complaints and organized an internal task 
force team to tackle the problem. In late March that year, the company developed a solution through network quality inspection and applied the solution nationwide in April, blocking any 
call disturbances arising from GPS interference.
The company keeps track of the results of coverage expansion to suburbs, mountain hiking trails, 
and the seas, using KPI, and provides financial support to ensure universal communication with 
other carriers for those living in remote,  mountainous areas or islands where such service is very 
rarely accessible. The universal service fund for 2010 determined in March 2012 totaled to KRW 
60.6 billion, and SK Telecom paid 36% of it, or KRW 21.8 billion.Improving

In April 2012, SK Telecom ranked first place in the “2011 Communication Service Quality Evalua-
tion” announced by the Korea Communications Commission for four consecutive years. SK Tele-
com’s 3G call quality enables its call success rate to be higher than 96.07%, the average rate of 
the world’s 7 cities (London, Paris, Frankfurt, Toronto, Tokyo, Singapore, and Sydney), and is also rated “S”, which is very high among the ratings for mobile phones recommended by the Interna-
tional Telecommunications Union (ITU). SK Telecom will continue its investment and research to 
improve call quality and maintain high-quality service. Coverage support for

Providing Reasonable Rates
SK Telecom is dedicated to lowering the rates for customers who may be excluded from mobile 
phone services for financial reasons. Since 2008, the company has increased discount benefits 
for people of lower income and supported the use of recycled and used phones. It also provided 
discounts worth about KRW 223.5 billion to the disabled and veterans, care facilities, childcare facilities, and facilities for the disabled. 
Reinforcing the discount program for the disabled
In order to lower call rates for disabled customers, SK Telecom offers signup fee exemptions and 35% discounts on activation fees, voice and data call rates based on the plan that a customer 
chooses. For those with hearing impairments and speech impediments, the company provides ad-
ditional 35% discounts on phone mails, MMS, video calls, and fixed-rate video calls. In 2011, the company launched “All-in-One Sonsarang 34” and “All-in-One Sorisarang 34” smartphone plans 
for the disabled. “All-in-One Sonsarang 34,” the plan for the hearing-impaired, allows significantly 
more video calls and text messages, instead of voice calls, and “All-in-One Sorisarang 34” for the visually impaired provides more time for voice calls to promote users’ convenience.
Reinforcing the discount program for the elderly
Launched in November 2011, “Silver Smart 15” is the first smartphone plan in Korea for the elder -
ly aged over 65, which offers the cheapest fixed rate of KRW 15,000. In March 2012, the company 
also released two types of LTE plans, LTE Golden Age 15 and 34, which included more voice, video, 
and data benefits. To ensure smooth communication between family members and relatives, a 
stronger designated 3-circuit benefit is now available. Additional benefits are provided for elderly 
customers; for customers who are new to the Golden Age 34 plan or who have changed phones, 
one year of free voice phishing insurance is provided.As part of the government’s price stabilization plan, SK Telecom worked hard to offer a variety of low-rate benefits in 2011. In February 2011, beginning  with the Youth Smartphone Rate Plan, the 
company provided KRW 1,000 discounts on activation fees and 50 free messages on its SMS for all customers in September. It also launched the “Customized Plan” in which a user can adjust the rates of voice, messages, and data to individual patterns in order to lower the call rates for customers.Introducing

SK Telecom continues to work hard to increase mutual value 
through stronger “open collaboration” with partners and employ-ees. By building a collaborative relationship with partners, and by 
pursuing a work-life balance for employees, the company intends 
to encourage a culture of win-win partnerships and seek mutual development.
Challenges
The further convergence and globalization of industries have created 
an environment that makes it difficult for an individual company to survive on its own capabilities. In addition, the growing social de-
mand for win-win partnerships with small and medium enterprises 
has raised a need for a plan to develop a business ecosystem. In regard to employees, greater emphasis on the importance of hu-man resources has increased the importance of securing employees’ long-term satisfaction and loyalty to the company. It also highlights issues concerning the protection of employees’ human rights.
Goal & Strategy
Communication
SK Telecom carries out communication with partners through a 
variety of channels, such as a Open2U website, BR Camp, and Part-ners’ Day. Employees are allowed two-way communication with 
the company through the Intranet, newsletters, broadcasting, mes-

Creating a Win-Win Partnership Culture
Issue 4  SK Telecom maintains a fair and transparent relationship with part-
ners based on mutual trust. By increasing channels of communication with partners 
and operating specialized support programs, the company will build win-win part-
nerships and create a win-win corporate culture. 04
SK Telecom works hard to ensure that practical support is given to partners through a win-win 
partnership support system based on mutual trust between both sides. The company will continue 
to work hard to enhance partners’ capabilities by implementing ICT-based technical, financial, and 
training support and by helping to strengthen their capabilities, including through technical support, 
funding, and training to energize the ICT ecosystem, using SK Telecom’s proprietary technology 
and infrastructure. In addition, by signing a partnership agreement, the company declares its deter -
mination to pursue win-win partnerships and tries to fulfill them in a fair and transparent manner.  
Signing win-win partnership agreements
In 2011, SK Telecom officially signed win-win partnership agreements with a total of 349 partners, 317 tier-1 and 32 tier-2 partners. At 
each signing ceremony, the CEO attended and promised to increase systematic support for not only tier-1 but also tier-2 partners, such 
as training programs and the Win-Win Fund. In addition, the company created a process for the periodic monitoring of results to con-
tinue its compliance with the agreement. In January 2012, the company reaffirmed its determination to achieve win-win partnerships by signing partnership agreements with a total of 263 partners, including 234 tier-1 and 29 tier-2 partners. The company also conduct-
ed an interim assessment of its compliance status and made improvements, such as taking additional measures for defective parts.  
Win-Win Partnership Implementation System 
Across the entire business lifecycle with a partner, from selection to the follow-up assessment, the company reinforces transparency 
and fairness. When selecting a partner, the company holds a competitive bid based on the objective criteria pursuant to the Supplier 
Management Rules, and created and operates the 7-member Procurement Review Committee including the procurement officer, and 
the committee reviews the adequacy of the partner selection process. In 2011, the company introduced the two guidelines of the Fair Trade Commission and made amendments to the Procurement Management and Partner Management rules. In 2012, it will reinforce 
its Win-Win Partnership Implementation System by incorporating the four guidelines of the Fair Trade Commission, which are the cri-
teria and procedure for price adjustments, into the company rules. When doing business with a partner, the company requires that the 
related employees comply strictly with the Compliance Program, which was introduced in 2002, and internal auditing is conducted 
on a regular or irregular basis. During a follow-up assessment, the company ensures that the partner is fairly evaluated based on the standard evaluation sheet, and the results are made available to the partner. Laying the

Improving partners’ 
technical capabilities by providing a test infra-structure environmentSK Telecom created the MD Test Center and Platform Test-bed for partners. The MD Test Center 
provides partners with the test infrastructure needed to develop mobile content so that they can make the best use of their R&D capabilities. This center also selects excellent ideas among those suggested by partners to support developers and development infrastructure (planning/develop-ment training, phones, etc) and offers incentives based on the results. The Platform Test-bed pro-
vides an infrastructure environment, which allows the testing of services under development in 
a wireless network, and the company is planning on the continuous operation and increase of infrastructure support to strengthen partners’ technical capabilities. 22
23Vitalization of  
the ICT industry  
ecosystemSK Telecom supports the development of an innovative business model and commercialization of 
ideas through the participation of a variety of external entities, including partners, customers, and 
developers. Through this, the company intends to energize the ecosystem of the entire ICT industry.  
T-Academy to develop mobile experts
SK Telecom created training programs at the T-Academy that are designed to strengthen the ca-
pabilities of mobile service development of partners, customers, and developers. It provides mo-
bile service development, mobile service planning, and design capability development courses. 
In 2011, at T-Academy, a total of 134 subjects were created to develop mobile IT experts who, upon completion of the related courses in which SK Telecom’s mobile experience and expertise 
are passed on and these expert instructors provide systematic learning, can be immediately ap-
pointed to an actual job, and as a result, 7.248 experts were produced. The company will continue 
to create and operate training programs for partners, customers, and developers. In addition, by 
developing experts in the mobile service development field, the company provides partners with 
opportunities to hire excellent human resources and job-seekers with information on employment to secure human resources. In particular, the company created a mobile community to share infor -
mation on mobile development, planning, and designs, and holds periodic job fairs for T-Academy students so that they can have one-on-one interviews with partners. SK Telecom’s continuing spe-cialized education programs will help its partners secure technical capabilities and reinforce their 
expertise by sharing ICT-specialized knowledge and developing their human resources. 
Open Innovation Center to commercialize ideas
SK Telecom’s Open Innovation Center, a program designed to support partners or one-person 
start-ups, selects and offers rewards for excellent ideas among those suggested by customers or 
developers, and also develops the ideas selected from Idea Contests into applications. To strength-
en the capabilities of partners, individuals, and developers, and implement commercialization, the center provides infrastructure, such as the MD Test Center and Platform Test-bed, and supports the 
training of experts in collaboration with the T-Academy. The center also provides technical, market-
ing, and development costs for corporate or individual developers, and is planning on creating a mobile ecosystem by developing an innovative business model and commercializing ideas.

Plan to expand the mobile industry support system 
In May 2012, SK Telecom created the T-Open Lab in which all partners, including one-person enter -
prises, share infrastructure, such as SK Telecom’s network-based R&D capabilities and Test-bed. In 
addition, through the T-Open Lab, the company intends to efficiently support a series of processes, 
from selecting promising areas to joint R&D and commercialization, become a technology leader in the ICT industry, along with its partners, and develop new growth drivers. In addition to this,  but for 
one-person enterprises and partners, the company is creating the One-Stop Creation System, which integrates training, start-up, and business support. SK Telecom’s One Stop Creation System provides one-person and venture enterprises with creativity, technology, and determination, with all neces-
sary training and support across the lifecycle, and the company is working hard to launch it in 2012. 
Technical support through the signing of LTE technical collaboration agreements between 
large companies and SMEs
In July 2011, SK Telecom signed a win-win partnership agreement with large equipment manufac-
turers and small repeater manufacturers. It also proposed a new model for win-win partnership in 
order to ensure the sound development of the Korean telecommunications equipment industry in 
this era of LTE and win-win partnerships between large companies and SMEs. Through this agree-ment, large manufacturers agreed to actively support small repeater manufacturers in producing 
50% of RU equipment for all LTE base stations through progressive technical collaboration, such 
as disclosing their own core technologies. 
SK Telecom reinforces systematic and practical support for mutual growth, including financial sup-
port to help partners strengthen their capabilities and non-financial support, such as joint technol-ogy development, technology protection, and employee training.
Expanding financial support for partners
In 2011, SK Telecom’s Win-Win Fund raised KRW 70 billion to provide partners with financial sup-port, and the partners who are beneficiaries of the fund are entitled to 2.4% to 2.6% interest dis-
counts. Between 2009 and 2011, loan payments made from the Win-Win Fund amounted to KRW 
128.3 billion, and 196 partners used this program. To secure funding for partners, SK Group’s Pri-vate Equity Fund (PEF) was created in late 2011, and eligible partners with core technologies and Expanding support

company provides tier-1 and tier-2 partners with free management consulting services, introduced the “Business Doctor Program” designed to support partners’ management consulting and im-
provement, and in 2011, supported the management consulting of a total of 5 partners. SK Telecom Sustainability Report 2011

and has actively participated in the group-wide partner support program. SK Telecom operates 
“Network Loan” which provides loans to partners in connection with Korean banks. Loan limits 
are based on the business performance and orders provided by partners, and the partners granted permission can receive a loan within such limit at a designated bank. As of 2011, a total of KRW 
39.9 billion has been provided in loan payments. Additionally, the company opened and operated 
about 120 training courses including the “CEO Seminar,” to support partners’ human resources development, in which a total of 12,400 people attended. 
Improving payment methods and shortening loan periods
Since 2005, SK Telecom has supported partners’ liquidity by paying 100% of purchase prices in cash under purchase agreements. It also introduced the “Small Business Care Program,” a pre-
ferred payment program for SMEs so that any small business that applies to the program can 
receive a payment the day after internal bill approval, regardless of the amount. 
SK Telecom created a variety of communication channels to grow with partners, and has explored 
plans to listen to their opinions and seek mutual growth. In addition, the company prepared a 
platform to continuously check and improve the direction of SK Telecom’s win-win partnerships 
through BPSI (Business Partner Satisfaction Index).
Operating online communication channels
SK Telecom operates the “Voice of Partners” channel through which partners’ opinions are received under the Open2U System. Through this channel, about 8,500 partner company members are al-
lowed to present a variety of opinions, such as complaints about unfair trade, recommendations, 
and suggestions. In 2011, a total of three reports on unfair trade were received through the Voice of Partners and were all resolved through internal investigations and measures. SK Telecom will 
continue to enforce fair trade with partners by reflecting a greater variety of opinions in its business 
activities and implementing the measures through active online communication with its partners.  
Expanding offline communication channels
SK Telecom is increasing face-to-face meetings and channels of communication with partners, such as its One-on-One meetings, BR Camp, and Partners’ Day. The One-on-One meeting is a pro-
gram in which the company visits a partner, listens to their grievances, and discusses solutions on-site. Each year, about 100 visits to partners are made. BR Camp is an event in which information on SK Telecom’s direction and policies is shared and opinions on the direction of Win-Win Partner -
ships are publicly accepted. Four sessions were held in 2011, where 97 partners and 167 people attended and shared opinions.Win-Win  
Communication
On November 28, 2011, SK Telecom held the “2011 SK Telecom Partners’ Day” to celebrate their 
2011 partnership performance together with the representatives of 30 partners in attendance. 
First held in 2006, this year’s “Partners’ Day” welcomed its 6th anniversary as an event in which 
the company, along with best-performing partners, looked back at the past year’s performance and renewed their determination to continuously create a win-win partnership model based on 
mutual trust.  This event also awarded Best Prizes in the fields of marketing, enterprise business, 
network, IT, and R&D, and Excellence and Good prizes to 25 best-performing partners.

Business Partner Satisfaction Index
SK Telecom conducts an annual BPSI (Business Partner Satisfaction Index), which investigates the 
partners’ satisfaction with their collaborative relationships with SK Telecom, conduct of business, 
and support programs. Around 700 partners are surveyed with regard to fairness, good faith, and 
performance, and in 2011, the index got a score of 74.52, a 0.16-point increase from the 2010 index. SK Telecom reflects the BPSI results in the internal goals of relevant teams and continues to 
work hard to increase the BPSI of its partners. 
SK Telecom also includes tier-2 partners and stores in this culture of win-win partnerships. In 
2011, the company expanded to tier-2 partners the Win-Win Partnership Support programs, such 
as the Win-Win Fund, online/offline training, and productivity improvement programs, which were originally designed for tier-1 partners. In addition, during an annual year-end partner assessment, 
the company provided extra points and the Procurement Preference Program, which exempts op-
tional contracts and performance bonds, to any tier-1 partners who signed agreements with tier-2 partners, to encourage win-win partnerships and fair-trade agreements between tier-1 and tier-2 
partners. SK Telecom will spread the culture of win-win partnerships to tier-2 partners, as well 
as tier-1 partners, and work with the partners on continuous win-win partnership activities. The widely spread culture of Win-Win Partnerships is expected to become the driving force behind the 
stable supply chain and sustainable growth in the long term as well as have a positive impact on 
the company’s ability to cope with the fast-changing ICT industry. 
Store Benefits programs |  SK Telecom introduced benefits programs for store employees as 
part of its win-win partnership strategy and provides the benefits that any employee at a large 
conglomerate would enjoy. The Store Benefits programs include installment  savings account sup -
port, self-development tuition fees support, free medical checkups, free risk insurance, and issu -
ing credit cards for store employees only with great discount benefits, and the company will also provide approximately KRW 6 billion to about 8,000 employees at 2,400 stores nationwide.
T-Master Small Manager Program |  The T-Master Small Manager Program was created to 
motivate store employees to design their own futures and provide them an opportunity to run a store on their own for three years without extra investment money by selecting among the best-
performing employees. SK Telecom ensures that this program encourages store employees to 
spontaneously serve customers better and succesfully carry out business activities. Extending the

Issue 5  SK Telecom works hard to provide equal opportunities for the so-
cially vulnerable, such as people with disabilities and local talent, who are at a disad-
vantage in society as well as make gender equality a reality by operating a variety of 
programs for female employees. In addition, the company tries to ensure employees’ work-life balance by creating a horizontal, open-minded culture with efficient com-
munication among employees.
SK Telecom guarantees equal opportunities and diversity in hiring and HR management, and has 
set an example by implementing a policy that takes the socially vulnerable into consideration. Re-cently, the company launched a variety of programs to boost female employees’ capabilities and 
ensure that they are sufficiently remunerated and can stay  focused at work. 
Open recruitment for the socially vulnerable
SK Telecom provides a separate place for the disabled to take written tests before hiring them and 
gives extra points as preferential treatment in each stage of recruitment. In 2011, the company be-
gan to give extra points to candidates who are eligible under the “Veterans’ Benefits and Support 
Act.” The company also extended the activity of on-campus recruiting to local colleges and began 
to implement a policy to secure distinguished human resources from local communities by giving them extra points in each stage of recruitment. In 2012, the company plans on applying absolute assessments to candidates with disabilities by launching special screenings for the disabled and hiring more socially vulnerable candidates by introducing the Internship for the Disabled program.
Reinforcing female employee benefits programs
SK Telecom guarantees maternity and childcare leaves for female employees and conducts ab-solute assessments for those employees based on their three-year performance to prevent those 
on childcare leave from suffering any disadvantages during performance appraisals. The company 
also created female-employee lounges at every level of the headquarters building and, in 2007, built a childcare facility inside SKT Tower so that employees with children can leave their children 
under suitable care. In 2011, 97% of the female employees who were on maternity leave returned 
and worked for over 12 months, which shows that most female employees continue to work after taking childcare leave. Respect for

SK Telecom operates the “manager-based organization” system to establish a horizontal organiza-
tional culture and also implements the Smart Office to ensure convenience at work and create a cul-
ture of open communication. In addition, the company intends to create a culture in which employ-
ees freely share opinions through the channels of communication between the CEO and employees.
Operating a manager-based organization
SK Telecom operates a team manager/member system to create a horizontal, creative organiza-tional culture. Both inside and outside the company, employees are officially called “manager,” 
and the “Pay Band” system is applied in which positions are classified into five levels, from B1 to 
A. The “manager” is a term introduced to ensure mutual respect and horizontal communication and emphasize each employee’s responsibility.
Creating the “Smart Office”
SK Telecom created the Smart Office by providing all employees with tablet PCs and applications to ensure open communication and mobility within the workplace, ultimately increasing efficiency 
at work. Employees perform tasks in connection with the in-house cloud service, and the updated 
document reading feature and other additional features reduce the amount of paper printed and helped establish the Smart Office environment in which necessary information is accessible any-
time, anywhere. Through this, SK Telecom has saved its purchased paper (eco-friendly recycled pa-
per) worth KRW 130 million.  
Open participation culture
In January 2009, SK Telecom created an online communication channel for the CEO and employ-ees called “Sotong Hanmadng” and, in 2011, formed a steering committee consisting of 12 mem-
bers, including the operating officer and a member from each department, and holds committee 
meetings in order to create a culture of open participation. “Sotong Hanmadang,” an online com-munication channel, allows the CEO to share his management policy and philosophy and em-
ployees to share their stories in a casual manner. The channel strictly maintains anonymity so that 
employees can express their opinions on a range of company issues more comfortably. As of now, a total of 1,900 opinions have been posted on the message board, keeping the channel active.Creating a horizon -
tal organizational 
culture
SK Telecom provides a variety of opportunities for communication to protect employees’ human rights 
and create a culture of open participation, such as legal consulting, a space for union members, griev -
ance mechanisms, and sexual harassment consulting, in which employees’ opinions and grievances are accepted and resolved. In particular, quarterly meetings of the Labor-Management Council are held in which employees discuss with the management regarding major issues, such as improving productivity, results-based pay, and employees’ benefits and human rights.

SK Telecom is strengthening its ICT-based CSR activities, in order to 
achieve more efficient and sustainable social transformation utiliz-ing its own technologies and infrastructure. In addition, in a rap-
idly changing ICT environment, the company plans to strengthen 
its community involvement programs in the whole ICT value chain by establishing the ICT social safety net, creating ICT-based jobs, narrowing the ICT gaps and providing a platform for advancing the culture of giving. Furthermore, it plans to contribute to creat-ing greater social value by sharing its technologies and capabilities 
with various stakeholders. 
Challenges
There is a need for efforts to narrow the ‘smart gap’ that has 
emerged amid the recent proliferation of smartphones and tablet PCs. In addition, with the issues of ‘capitalism 4.0’ and ‘even de-
velopment’, there is a higher demand for companies to meet its 
social responsibilities for the disabled, disadvantaged and troubled individuals.

Communication
Utilizing social contribution websites such as ‘T-Together’, ‘GiveU’ 
and SK Telecom’s SNS(Facebook, Twitter, and Blog), the company is actively sharing the culture of giving among the stakeholders. In particular, it provides platforms and opportunities for its stake-
holders to directly participate in SK Telecom’s social activities, by 
actively communicating its willingness for CSR activities to various

06Improving social value by utilizing ICT 
Issue 6  The rapidly developed ICT services have provided a new and ef-
ficient way of living for people, but at the same time has produced related social 
problems as well. Using ICT, SK Telecom is trying to resolve these social issues as 
well as  improve the social value. 
SK Telecom is creating social value by sharing its ICT capabilities, and engaging in social con-
tribution activities in a systematic and sustainable manner, in order to achieve sustainable so-cial change and transformation based on improved social value. The company is expanding the scope of utilizing ICT for the public interest and contributing to the social transformation in vari-ous groups and fields in the community. Also, it is linking together the voluntary activities and 
social contribution programs, customers and university students for the purpose of improving the self-reliance of vulnerable people and resolving the educational gap, which will improve overall ef-ficiency. Furthermore, as a the ‘Happiness Creator’ that brings about social changes through ICT in cooperation with government agencies and NGOs, the company strives  to share the sustainable happiness with the stakeholders.
SK Telecom is contributing to the growth of ICT-based public services by creating jobs through the 
ICT social enterprise and helping disadvantaged people improve their self-reliance. 
Establishing ‘Happy ICT’, a social enterprise
 In July 2011, SK Telecom established ‘Happy ICT’ which is a social enterprise for the purpose of creating IT-based jobs for disadvantaged people. ‘Happy ICT’ has been developing IT-based public services by utilizing the company’s knowledge in public services such as mobile donation, locating missing children, counseling, blood donation, improving the IT competitiveness of social enterprises, 
and also contributing to the creation of decent jobs for disadvantaged people. In addition, SK Tele-
com is providing internship opportunities for disabled people and low-income earners who have completed the basic IT development training, in order to help them understand the field through their experiences in project involvement, and give them opportunities to find regular jobs in the future. ‘Happy ICT’ is a representative model of social enterprises based on company participation and has employed 19 people from the disadvantaged social group such as disabled people, as of late 2011. In 2012, we plan to increase the number of employees to 40 people and obtain the social enterprise certification from the City of Seoul and Ministry of Employment and Labor. Strategic system

31Operating the ‘Hope Application Academy’ 
Since 2011, SK Telecom has been operating the ‘Hope Application Academy’ in cooperation with the 
City of Seoul. This is a free course for smartphone application developers for the purpose of aiding 
low-income disadvantaged people find jobs, as they are having difficulties in finding jobs due to 
their familiy situations and the lack of educational opportunities. The ‘Hope Application Academy’ is 
a long-term, not a one-time , program that helps disadvantaged people gain economic self-reliance. 
The academy utilizes the education infrastructure-facilities, instructors and curriculum of the ‘T- Acad-
emy’, which is SK Telecom’s training institute for mobile application developers, and conducts courses 
on developing mobile applications from the basic course to the advanced course on the application development practice. In 2011, there were 8 students, mainly in their 20’s or mid-30’s, who wanted 
to pursue an IT career although they had not received professional IT training due to difficult family situations. All but one student, who entered the military, succeeded in finding jobs in the IT field. 
Happy ICT, a social enterprise established by SK Telecom, employed 4 of the students. SK Telecom 
plans to contribute to the economic self-reliance of disadvantaged people by providing them with its 
education assets. 
The ‘digital divide’ refers to the widening gap between different groups in their access, use and 
acquisition of the ICTs. SK Telecom supports teenagers from low-income families and disabled 
people in order to help them minimize the digital gap and move into the broader world through 
ICT. In addition, the company is leading efforts in resolving the smart information gap due to the recent spread of smartphones and tablet PCs. 
Narrowing the ICT gap for teenagers from low-income families 
In order to resolve the social issue of social marginalization and lack of educational opportunities due to the widening of the information gap, SK Telecom has provided free tablet PCs to 350 teen-
agers from low-income families nationwide in November 2011, and is also offering free online courses and data charges through ‘T-Smart Learning’. In addition, the company has been been 
operating the local center for teenagers ‘1318 Happy Zone’ in cooperation with the Leftovers Love 
Sharing Community. Furthermore, Sunny, SK Telecom’s collegiate volunteer corps.,  has been teach-
ing IT, arts and physical education to teenagers who belong to local centers on a one-on-one volunteer basis.  Narrowing the

Providing content and a 
platform to reduce the 
information gap for the 
blindNarrowing the ICT gap for disabled people
SK Telecom has been conducting various activities to bridge the gap between disabled people and 
the community through ICT. We have been conducting the ‘IT Challenge competitions for disabled 
teenagers’ since 1999, in order to help disabled teenagers gain IT professional capabilities and 
successfully settle in the community. This competition tests the internet search abilities and office 
program utilization of the participants. In 2011 there were 840 participants in the qualifying round 
and 150 participants in the final round. In addition, SK Telecom developed and provided a terminal with an enhanced TTS (Text to Speech) function for the blind in June 2010, and also developed the 
‘Library that Reads Happiness’, the simultaneous voice contents support program, and integrated 
the program in 8 different terminals. In 2011, the company released a smartphone application 
version of the ‘Library that Reads Happiness’, for which community members participated as vol-unteers in voice recording, and helped the blind gain access to documents such as newspapers, 
magazines and books in an more efficient way. 
Mobile phone user training ‘Happy mobile world’ for senior citizens
In order to prevent a lack of communication between generations due to rapid development of 
communications technologies and services, SK Telecom has been conducting ‘Happy mobile 
world’, the mobile phone user training for senior citizens. The participants of Sunny, SK Telecom’s 
collegiate volunteer corps.,  have established one-on-one mentoring relationships with senior 
citizens. They visited the senior citizen welfare centers in their local communities and taught them how to use mobile phones. For 5 years from 2007 to 2011, the university students taught a total 
of 7,378 senior citizens how to send text messages, and use various functions such as the alarm 
and the calendar. In 2010 and November 2011 as well, there was a ‘E-um(connection) festival’ a 
competition that tests mobile phone utilization by senior citizens who participated in ‘Happy mo-
bile world’. The average age of the participants was 73.3 years old and 80 senior citizens and 20 volunteers from Sunny participated in the event. In addition, SK Telecom began smartphone utili-
zation training for senior citizens in line with the rapid proliferation of smartphones since 2011, 
and its plan is to expand the program nationwide in 2012. 
Mobile phone user training for North Korean refugees
SK Telecom has been conducting the mobile phone user training for North Korean refugees who entered Hanawon since 2008 in cooperation with the Ministry of Unification. The major content of 
the training include learning instances of mobile phone fraud such as fraud admission, excessive 
charges for international calls, and identity-theft, and also learning the appropriate mobile phone 
etiquette and culture. The teaching material and actual training were organized by SK Telecom 
members on a volunteer basis. In 2011, there were 15 classes in total, and 731 refugees attended 
the class in Hanawon and 103 refugees attended the class in the Seoul Hana center.
In 2011, SK Telecom developed and released, for the first time in Korea, the ‘Library that Reads Hap-
piness’, the smartphone voice contents service that provides useful information from newspapers and books to the blind through a smartphone application. As of 2011, the ‘Library that Reads Happiness’ has been uploaded with 51,841 documents such as books of every genre, news, weekly magazines, monthly magazines and news on rehabilitation and welfare. The document uploading was achieved 
by about 1,000 volunteers such as SK Telecom members, customer center employees, and professional 
voice actors since April 2011. In order to improve the convenience of volunteer participation, the com-pany set up 9 recording booths in total, including 3 recording booths in customer service centers located in Seoul, and 5 other recording booths in customer service centers located elsewhere. In addition, SK Telecom participated in the ‘2011 Seoul International Book Fair’ in June 2011, and demonstrated the ‘Library that Reads Happiness’ application, which received huge public support. Our future plan is to continue to develop documents in order to provide high-quality information to the blind, and donate recorded voice books to the Korea Blind Union.SK Telecom Sustainability Report 2011

33SK Telecom introduced various types of exemplary public services utilizing its ICT infrastructure, 
fulfilling its corporate social responsibilities as an ICT company, and contributing to the promotion of stakeholders’ social participation and encouraging a culture of giving in the whole community. 
Leading the ICT safety net
SK Telecom has consistently worked on the establishment of the social safety net that can swiftly deal with emergency situations by utilizing the national subscriber network and ICT technologies in cooperation with the government and NGOs. The representative mobile social safety net services include the ‘mobile location mission children’ and the ‘mobile blood donation’. In particular, the 
‘mobile donation’ is the first mobile service in the world since 2007 on information related to blood 
donation and reservations for blood donation, for the purpose of promoting blood donation among 
the general public. In 2011, the company released the ‘Smart Blood Donation’, a smartphone ap-plication developed in cooperation with The Korean Red Cross, with additional functions of find-ing blood donation venues, blood donation reservations, sharing information on emergency blood donation for the purpose of improving the convenience of the blood donors. In addition, SK Tele-com has been been leading in the introduction of various social safety net services in cooperation with government agencies, NGOs and other service providers, such as the ’112 emergency report’ application in cooperation with the National Police Agency, the ‘119 emergency rescue service’ in 
cooperation with the National Emergency Management Agency, and the ‘mobile overseas safety 
service’ in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Furthermore, the company plans to expand and revise the services in line with the smartphone, LTE, and the 4G mobile com-munications network. In particular, we will strengthen the social safety net platform service for the emergency disaster relief. 
Providing the platform for spreading the culture of giving
SK Telecom has been a leader in encouraging a culture of charity by utilizing our wired and wire-
less infrastructure in facilitating the social contribution activities of our customers. In 2009, we opened the wired/wireless social contribution portal site ‘T-Together’ and the website has pro-
moted the volunteer activities of our customers and provided a platform for spreading the culture 
of charity. The mobile donation program that had been operated since 2004 was integrated and 
expanded into the ‘GiveU’, a smartphone application which was released in late 2010 for the 
purpose of creating an enhanced donation platform where customers can choose their donation 
payment method such as rainbow points, OK Cash-back points, cash, and credit cards. As of 2011, 
the total amount of money donated, including matching funds, is KRW 120 million. Distribution of

culture of giving by utilizing SNS. The ‘Happy social giving’ campaign has selected one case among NGO beneficiaries of ‘GiveU’ and accumulated KRW 500~1,000 for the NGO for a supporting message and retweet(RT) of the followers of the SK Telecom SNS Channel. In addition, the company provided oppor -
tunities to our SNS followers to participate in offline volunteer activities. It has conducted 5 campaigns 
in 2011, and 53,257 customers participated campaigns. The campaigns collected KRW 29.77 million, all

In order to help Japan recover from the March 2011 earthquake in the north-east region, the company’s 
CEO and members voluntarily participated in recovery operations and fundraising campaigns. Immedi-ately after the earthquake, the CEO suggested that members of ‘Sotong Hanmadang’ (Single communica-
tion court) post any ideas on how to help Japan on SK Telecom’s internal communication channel, and 60 
ideas were subsequently posted. Of the 60 ideas posted, 9 ideas were finally adopted to actually provide support for Japans’ recovery from the earthquake. Teenagers’ access to harmful content on mobile phones has emerged as a social issue. The distribution 
of adult material through mobile devices tripled in 2011, highlighting the importance of establishing a decent communications service environment for teenagers. SK Telecom is protecting its teenage custom-
ers from harmful content through not only physical and technical measures, but also activities that lead to 
perception changes among teenagers and adults. 
Establishing the harmful content blocking program
SK Telecom suspended its adult content service through the mobile internet in 2006, and has been provid-ing a harmful content filtering service since 2008. As concerns about teenager’s access to adult content has risen along with their increasing use of smartphones, SK Telecom developed and released the ‘Green 
T’ application in 2010 in Korea, which automatically blocks adult content and applications. In 2012, the 
company plans to introduce the solution technology that can block downloading of harmful or adult con-tent within the network at the source level, and provide this free service to teenagers and parents. 
Conducting a campaign to prevent mobile phone addiction
 Since 2006, SK Telecom has been conducting a campaign to prevent mobile phone addiction by teen-agers for the purpose of creating a culture where they can use their mobile phones appropriately. The 
company  started developing online education content since 2009, allowing teenagers to receive online 
education on the use of mobile phones. In 2012, its plan is to expand the education for not only teenag-
ers but also for parents and teachers. 
T teenager relief service 
In order to enhance the teenager customer protection in the smartphone environment and improve the existing harmful content blocking service in terms of its costs, content blocking rate and user inconve-nience, SK Telecom developed and distributed, for free, the ‘T teenager relief service’ since May 2012, 
which automatically distinguishes and blocks harmful content in the network, without any need to install 
a separate mobile application in a device. The ‘T teenager relief service’ can block 99% of harmful content at their source level on the mobile internet accessed through smartphones, such as 2 million harmful web pages, 20,000 harmful applications and 100,000 harmful movie clips. It is also improving its effectiveness 
through daily updates to its harmful content database. Customers under the age of 19 or their guardians 
can conveniently apply for the service through SK Telecom retail stores, the customer service center or online (www.tworld.co.kr), improving customer convenience.

●Achieved   ◑ Partial  ◎ Ongoing  ○Not achievedCommitment
SK Telecom actively practices ethics management, which lays the 
foundation for stakeholders’ trust and sustainable growth. The company will work hard to ensure the ethical, independent op-
eration of the Board of Directors and wholesome decision-making, 
centering on the Corporate Citizenship Committee and Audit Com-mittee, and implement practical ethical management through the advanced Ethics Management System, the reinforcement of audit-ing/investigative functions, and the autonomous, ethical risk man-
agement activities. 
Challenges
In today’s more complex business environment, regulatory bodies 
and investors evaluate a company’s soundness and sustainability using even more sophisticated criteria. In particular, it has become 
ever more important to establish a transparent governance sys-
tem and responsible management by the management, which is responsible for the company’s decision-making. In addition, with non-financial risks being widely recognized, as well as financial risks, in terms of business management, a company’s ethical risks have become key considerations in ensuring stable management.
Goal & Strategy
Communication
SK Telecom implements transparent disclosure activities, such 
as regularly publishing the progress of and changes made to the Board of Directors and governance on its official website and re-
porting related information on the key disclosure sites. The com-
pany also operates the Ethical Consulting Center and provides periodic ethics management training for employees to improve their understanding of the Code of Ethics, while at the same time, reinforcing ethics management support activities through active communication with its subsidiaries and partners with regard to 
ethics management. Objective

Efforts at Transparent Governance
Issue 7  SK Telecom is dedicated to securing governance independence and 
reinforcing competence, focusing on the Board of Directors, in order to ensure rea-
sonable decision-making and management transparency through the checks-and-
balances of management, and shareholders.
Securing the independence of the Board of Directors
SK Telecom’s Board of Directors consists of eight members, three internal and five external direc -
tors, and makes decisions on key issues at a monthly meeting. SK Telecom specifies the ratio of 
External directors to be appointed to ensure the independence of each committee in the Board 
of Directors Regulations and operates the committees in a transparent manner, pursuant to the operating guidelines. In March 2012, External director Im, Hyeon-jin was appointed as the chair 
of the Board of Directors to reinforce the independence of governance. In addition, the Audit 
Committee and Compensation Review Committee are both made up of External directors, ensur -
ing the objectivity and transparency of the board’s activities.
Transparent director appointment process
SK Telecom appoints experts as directors, who have sufficient expertise and experience in business administration, economics, accounting, law, and related technology, and who can therefore con-
tribute to the company’s growth and the protection of shareholders’ rights. The External director 
Nominating Committee, which consists of at least three External directors, recommends External directors, and the candidates are selected by a majority vote of Board members in attendance. 
After that, each candidate’s appointment is determined through a transparent and legitimate pro-
cedure at a shareholders’ meeting.Independence of

SK Telecom conducts an annual assessment of the directors to determine whether they are com-
petent in terms of the company’s business and technology and have been actively engaged in 
Board of Directors activities, and discusses with the board regarding the assessment results. In ad-
dition, when recommending re-appointments by the External director Nominating Committee, the company takes account of the past performance of activities of the Board of Directors. Directors’ 
compensations and retirement benefits are determined by a resolution at a shareholders’ meeting, 
and compensations are provided in a fair, transparent manner, pursuant to the payment regula-tions, which were also decided through a resolution of the shareholders’ meeting.

In May 2008, SK Telecom created the Corporate Citizenship Committee under the Board of Directors to 
strengthen a company-wide connection between sustainability activities and business strategy and im-prove CSR capabilities. The Corporate Citizenship Committee consists of five members, four outside and one internal directors, and is responsible for setting a director in each of the five sustainability areas, such as Customer Relationship Management, Win-Win Partnerships, Community Involvement, Ethics 
Management, and Environmental Management, and carries out activities ranging from advice on CSR 
activities and checking key issues and performance. In 2011, the company worked hard to improve CSR capabilities by establishing mid- and long-term strategies for the five sustainability areas and checking action plans for the key CSR issues, such as privacy protection and win-win partnerships.

Internalizing Ethics Management
Issue 8  SK Telecom actively practices ethics management, which lays the 
foundation for the trust of stakeholders and sustainable growth.
SK Telecom developed an operating system to practice ethics management, created a related code 
of conduct, and continuously implemented ethics management training for employees, improving their awareness of ethics management. In addition, the company enforces continuous monitoring 
to consolidate employees’ ethical awareness, carries out activities to prevent risks through consult-
ing, auditing, and investigation, and continues to operate the PDR System, such as improving the system and process to prevent recurrence. 
SK Telecom created the 2002 Code of Ethics based on SKMS, SK’s management philosophy, and 
has conducted preventive activities against any ethical issues by providing guidelines on the Code 
of Ethics and decision-making to employees. In the beginning of each year, all employees pledge 
to comply with the Code of Ethics. While delivering the management’s determination to practice ethics management through executive and team leader training and conversations, the company 
has often reminded the employees of the importance of complying with the Code of Ethics using 
in-house notices and Webzines. Through Q&As and 100Q 100A on ethics management, the com-pany proposes practical and specific behavior guidelines. 
SK Telecom continues to provide training on ethics management, along with online and collective 
training programs for a variety of stakeholders, such as employees, subsidiaries, and partners, in 
order to incorporate the ethical mindset into the corporate culture. Since 2007, when the employ-
ee ethics management training was completed, business unit-based training was implemented to renew their determination and ability to practice ethics management, and in 2011, a total of 
4,780 employees completed level-based ethics management training, from executives to newly 
appointed team leaders, leader groups, and new/experienced employees. In addition, team-based 
ethics management consulting and feedback allows each team to redefine its ethical issues and 
reinforce autonomous practice through self-inspection.Ethics

Ethics management violations and efforts to prevent recurrence
Despite employees’ voluntary ethics management activities, the company held a meeting of 
the Personnel Committee and took disciplinary actions regarding 7 cases of violation of the Code of Ethics found in 2011. A total of 7 cases were subject to disciplinary action, including four cases of sexual harassment, a case of personal information leakage, an issue of business relations, and a violation of the Procurement Management Rules. Efforts were made to prevent 
recurrence, such as sharing individual cases with regard to disciplinary actions with employees 
using the company’s bulletin board, along with the executives’ message about ethics manage-ment, and providing training to make these cases widely known. 
SK Telecom abides by Korea’s Political Fund Act, which prohibits companies from making politi-
cal contributions. It is also an active supporter of government policies on anti-corruption, fair competition, job creation, gender equality, and low carbon, green growth.Reinforcing the 
ethical issue  
monitoring system
SK Telecom recognizes the importance of prevention and improves the existing programs and 
system through efficient responses to identified risks, and also systematizes the process to en-courage employees to voluntarily practice ethics management. The company also takes strict ac-tions against any corrupt activities that are discovered, notifies the Ethics Management Team of problems identified through preventive inspection, and carries out independent responses and 
program improvements company-wide. Efforts to improve

Public Policy 
CooperationSK Telecom operates an internal control system under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and a system for di-
rectly reporting to the chair of the Audit Committee on the website of SK Telecom, along with the Ethical Consulting Center, as channels through which ethical consulting to prevent ethical issues is provided to employees and unfair conduct or requests are reported. To prevent ethical issues from happening, thorough monitoring is conducted both online and offline. In 2011, the company 
officially operated a program to protect and reward reporters, including employees and partners 
and extended to its subsidiaries the self-control activity to prevent issues in each unit, which was launched in 2009, to lay the foundation for self-controls. As part of its endeavors, the company worked on 16 reports on unethical conduct, which were received through the Reporting Channel, and established the Code of Ethics that defines the criteria for regulating unethical partners. In 
addition to this,  in 2011, 180 interviews with employees and 119 with partners were conducted 
regarding ethics management to strengthen ethics management communication.

SK Telecom works hard to comply with applicable laws in all procedures across business activities. To 
comply with the regulations and laws, both Korean and international, the company made changes to the company-wide compliance reinforcement process and, as a means of improving risk management and 
the ability to practice, created the Early Warning system in 2007, leading in the spread of fair competition culture and consumer protection by coping with legal risks and issues. In 2011, there were two cases subject to penalties at SK Telecom, amounting to about KRW 8.8 billion.
Since 2002, when the company introduced the Compliance Program, SK Telecom has distributed Compli-
ance Checklists to employees each year and conducted tailored compliance training for each team. The company also strengthened internal monitoring to prevent the recurrence of issues on which the Korea 
Communications Commission imposed sanctions, proposed the behavior criteria for fair trade, created a 
system for early response to legal violations, and launched the Compliance website, so that employees easily understand the details of the Fair Trade Act. The company will continue to develop programs and training for fair trade compliance to reinforce employees’ cooperation.
SK Telecom declared its Human Rights Policy created based on the Ruggie Guiding Principles, which were 
announced by the UN Human Rights Council in June 2011, and complies with the policy by reflecting its responsibility for human rights in the Code of Ethics. Additionally, the company will create a company-
wide system for overseeing employees’ compliance with the Code of Ethics, human rights responsibility, 
negative effects, monitoring, and assessment, and become a leader in human rights protection. Efforts to practice

Pursuing green growth by realizing green ICT
Issue 9  Corporate efforts are required to cope with climate change, such as sav-
ing energy and using resources efficiently. SK Telecom is implementing efficient operations, 
research and development for environmental friendliness, and the spread of an eco-friendly culture. As a leading company in the telecommunications industry, it is consolidating its status as an environmentally conscious leading company pursuing the greening of not only 
the company but also the whole community. In order to achieve this, the company will carry 
out an ambitious investment and technology development, and create a green community through green ICT.
SK Telecom established and currently operates the ‘Green ICT committee’,  the highest decision-
making body’ on environmental management,  with participation from senior managers from all 
business fields. The company reformed the ‘Green ICT committee’ in the first half of 2011, in or -
der to enhance its executing power and specifying its tasks for environmental management. As 
an example, the company performed the computerization and the third party verification of the 
greenhouse gas inventory for the first time in the domestic communications industry, and based 
on this, the company will actively enhance its own capabilities in managing greenhouse gases and seek new business fields such as new and renewable energy. SK Telecom will actively continue to 
respond to climate including the improvement of energy efficiency, the reduction of social green-
house gases, and the establishment of an eco-friendly corporate culture. Pursuing green 
growth
In 2011, SK Telecom obtained the ISO 14001 certification created by ISO 
(International Organizations for Standardization). ISO 14001 is an inter -
national standard for environmental management systems and an ad-vanced management system designed to continuously monitor and reduce environmental burdens caused by corporate activities. By obtaining this 
certificate, SK Telecom has consolidated the environmental management 
system that deals with domestic and global climate change and different types of regulations in an active and efficient way, confirming its position as a green company leading the domestic telecommunications industry.Obtaining ISO 14001

43As a mobile communications service provider, SK Telecom does not emit any air pollutants and does 
not have any process that uses toxic and hazardous substances, as it does not manufacture prod-ucts itself. In addition, we have not violated any environmental regulations and have not paid any penalty or fine as a result of that. SK Telecom has established a company-wide system for respond-ing to global climate change and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and every member of the 
company is actively participating in the reduction activities. In addition, the company is expanding 
the scope of greenhouse gas management and diagnosing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions through real-time monitoring. SK telecom is also reducing its use of paper resources, expanding the distribution of electronic bills, minimizing its impact on the environment and green-ing its supply chain by complying with its duties for installing eco-friendly radio stations.
Greenhouse gas reduction activities
SK Telecom is making company-wide efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the case of the company building, with the aim of a 3% reduction in electricity consumption, it has estab-lished an integrated lighting control system, introduced high-efficiency air conditioners, adjusted the cooling temperature, turned off lighting in unused areas, and improved the efficiency of the management of heating and air conditioning after working hours in 2011. As a result, the com-
pany has achieved a 2.7% reduction in electricity consumption, close to the 2011 goal. However, 
as a result of the use of additional equipment, due to the establishment of the LTE network, and also additional equipment for transmission stations to deal with increased data traffic due to in-creased use of smartphones, and additional repeaters to eliminate the radio wave shadow areas, the company’s total greenhouse gas emissions has increased from the previous year. SK Telecom plans to increase the use of high-efficiency equipment, and establish base stations utilizing new and renewable energy, in order to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions and actively meet the requirement of the greenhouse gas and energy target management scheme. 
Replacing the consumption of resources 
SK Telecom increases the use of electronic bills, such as e-mail and mobile bills, to reduce the con-sumption of paper resources in mailing bills. In February 2011, the company launched the Smart Bill service through which electronic bills are sent to smartphones, and as a result of its continuous efforts, secured about 12,550,000 electronic bill subscribers, a 21.9% increase from the previous year. The company will continue to implement friendly communication regarding electronic bills 
with customers who use print bills. The company will also carry out promotions through its distribu-
tion channels and customer service center, and continuously implement joint promotional market-ing with the UNEP National Committee for the Republic of Korea to increase electronic bill users. Its efforts to reduce employees’ use of paper will include creating a “paperless” culture for custom-ers, paperless meetings within the company, and the expansion of the electronic payment system.  
Establishing an eco-friendly culture through the reuse of second-hand smartphones
As a pilot project from November 2011, SK Telecom began implementing the T-Eco phone project in order to promote the reuse of second-hand smartphones. The T-Eco phone project evaluates the purchase price of second-hand smartphones (with a usage of less than 2 years) from its customers, subtracts the purchase price from the billed amount, and resells the purchased or repaired second-hand phones to other customers at lower prices, contributing to the creation of an eco-friendly 
culture. As of February 2012, it has purchased 532,437 second-hand smartphones and resold 
them to its customers. In the future, the company will open second-hand phone inspection and purchase centers in major commercial areas, and facilitate the reuse of second-hand smartphones. Efforts for dealing

In October 2011, the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNCCD was held ‘paperless’ in 
Changwon, Gyeongsangnam-do for the first time. SK Telecom and the Provincial office of Gyeongsangnam-do signed the MOU on paperless operation of the 10th UNCCD conference and Smart Office for the provin-cial office. SK telecom provided 1,000 tablet PCs to the conference attendees so that they could conduct paperless meetings. SK Telecom also has developed the mobile application exclusively for the attendees, 
and enabled internet access anywhere within the meeting venue by establishing wired and wireless internet 
networks. Case Study 01

In 2011, SK Telecom developed “Cloud BEMS,” an energy management technology combined with the 
next-generation smart grid, using purely domestic technology. “BEMS” is a system designed to improve energy efficiency through the real-time collection and analysis of information from energy management facilities within an office building, and monitor the entire process from the monitoring of energy usage within a building, facility operations status, indoor environments and carbon emissions, to the creation 
of a simulation report on optimized operations, and to actual facility control and reduction measure-
ments. By introducing this system, each office building can reduce current energy consumption by 15 to 30%, and in 2011, SK Telecom’s Euljiro building reduced the total energy usage by 24% using this “BEMS.” Based on the results that the headquarters obtained, in 2012, this system will be introduced to SK Telecom’s key office buildings, and the company will implement the commercialization of the system in commercial buildings and those buildings that use a lot of energy, both in Korea and abroad, and earn additional income by saving energy and using ICT.

Developing the building 
management system for reduction in energy consumptionEstablishing eco-friendly radio stations for environmental protection 
SK Telecom minimized its base station installation impact on natural sceneries and the esthetic 
values of cities, by faithfully complying with the government standard for the installation of eco-
friendly radio stations. The government stipulates the installation of eco-friendly base stations or 
common base stations in the approval conditions if there is a need to protect the external view of 
cities and the natural environment. In accordance with this requirement, SK Telecom applied 10 
kinds of antenna standard models such as the ground low-level small antenna, installing 58,435 
eco-friendly radio stations in compliance with the eco-friendly standard. In addition, in order to 
prepare for the toughening  of regulations that require the mandatory installation of eco-friendly 
radio stations, we will install over 50% of the new radio stations as eco-friendly radio stations. 
High-efficiency eco-friendly radio stations
SK Telecom has installed and is operating low-electricity repeaters in 43,536 stations, which re-
duces electricity consumption by 13% compared to the analog repeaters. In addition, the com-
pany invested KRW 1.72 billion in 25 locations where electricity supply is unreliable, such as Sip-i-
dong-pa-do and Dae-gwan-ryung, in order to establish the base stations that are run by new and 
renewable energy such as solar energy and wind. 
Managing the eco-protection areas
In order to resolve the issue of remote areas, SK Telecom is installing base stations and repeaters in 
eco-protection areas such as the Ecological Landscape Preservation (A & a) Area. However, in such 
a case, the company’s basic policy is that it tries to  minimize the impact on plants and animals by 
utilizing the existing facilities such as parking lots located outside the eco-protection areas, while 
eliminating remote zones at the same time.  SK Telecom Sustainability Report 2011

45 The reduction in social greenhouse gas emissions is required in order to respond to global cli-
mate change, “green” the community and reduce the national greenhouse emissions. SK Telecom contributes to responding to the wider range of climate change by reducing the resource and energy consumption in everyday life through ICT technologies and contributing to reduction in 
social greenhouse emissions. 
Research on measuring and managing the social greenhouse gases
SK Telecom has conducted research, since 2010, ‘measuring and managing the social greenhouse gases’ that measures the impact of SK Telecom’s technologies and services on the reduction in the greenhouse gases emissions from everyday activities and the business activities of citizens. The impact of our new technologies and services was measured in each of the 14 categories in terms of how positively it contributed to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Based on the research findings, the company will lead the for -
mation of social perceptions on the need for new technologies and services, and also on the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. 
Until 2011, the company estimated the greenhouse gas coefficients for each of the 14 categories as well as the expected reductions 
in 2020, and it plans to measure the quantitative impact on each category in 2012. Also, SK Telecom will implement research projects in order to estimate the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through smart grid and smart city projects, and continue to encourage the eco-friendly way of living through ICT technologies. The total amount of SK Telecom’s social greenhouse gas emissions that can be reduced using ICT is equal to KRW 54.4 billion, when converted into the current trading currency of GHG emissions (3.54 EUR/tCO2), and SK Telecom will continue to contribute to social GHG reductions through more systematic research and management.

Case for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions through ICT: The T-Map service is SK Telecom’s 
mobile phone navigation application. It is a GPS-based service that guides users to optimal routes, con-
sidering the distance between the current location and the destination, and also the traffic conditions. The effects of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by using T-map navigation are shown in the traffic and industrial field, and it contributes to saving fuel and prolonging the life of  tires. 
Presentation on the reduction in social greenhouse gas emissions at an international confer -
ence: SK Telecom presented its research findings on its research on estimating the reduction in green-
house gas emissions through ICT technologies at ITU-D (International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector, Study Group 5) in Geneva, Switzerland in April, 2012. This research was jointly conducted in public-private cooperation with the National Radio Research Agency, Korea Communications Commission, and Korea Association for ICT Promotion. The research findings 
showed that, using ICT, the estimated greenhouse gas emissions of Korea can be reduced by 15% (120 
million tons) by 2020, utilizing the ICT technologies, and it gained huge support at the meeting as it was published as the ITU-D international report. In particular, a number of major telecommunications companies such as Telefonica, NTT and France Telecom showed its intention to participate in the re-search ‘Estimating the reduction in societal greenhouse gas emissions using real-time traffic information navigation system (T-Map)’, which was included as a representative case study .

•Identify key issues in relation to sustainability  In 2011, SK Telecom introduced an independent Materiality Analysis Process to assess the materiality 
of issues that were proposed by stakeholders. First, to reflect stakeholders’ opinions, the company con-
ducted an indirect stakeholder survey involving the CSR standards, global telecommunications company benchmarking, and media research, and proceeded with surveys and interviews with internal/external stakeholders. After that, the company determined the stakeholders’ level of interest and their overall 
impact on the business of SK Telecom and defined material issues. This report connects the key issues 
identified in SK Telecom’s five areas of sustainability.
SK Telecom conducted an indirect stakeholder survey involving the analysis of CSR standards and tele-
communications regulations, global benchmarking, media research, and past issue research. Through the 
analysis of CSR standards and telecommunications regulations, 33 issues were identified, and through the benchmarking of global telecommunications companies, media analysis, and the analysis of SK Tele-
com’s past issues, 46 issues were discovered. Through the process above, a total of 79 issues were identi-
fied, some of which were brought together, leading to a final selected list of 23 issues. • Assess the level of interest and

n Encouraging customers’ sustainability practiceOver the years, through its activities at the UNGC (UN Global 
Compact) Board, SK Telecom has worked with UNGC to dis-
seminate and develop CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) 
worldwide. At the first-half of the UNGC Board meeting held at the UN Headquarters in the U.S., in June 2011, SK Telecom 
presented a case study of the G20 Seoul Business Summit op-
erations and explained the need for the “One-Voice Platform,” which will represent the voice of companies. At the second-half 
of the UNGC Board of Directors meeting held in December, 
the company previewed the key action plans for UNGC and proposed a plan to accelerate corporate social participation 
through social enterprises. As the Board activities were con-
cluded by the end of 2011, the company plans on continuing collaboration focusing on the key CSR issues, such as the ex-
pansion of social enterprises in 2012.
 
Global cooperation for the development of CSR 
In January 2011, the company was invited to the “Global Com-pact LEAD”. GC LEAD was launched to facilitate the imple-
mentation of the “Leadership Blueprint” proposed by UNGC, 
and currently has 56 participating companies from around the world. In March 2011, at the 1st LEAD Symposium, SK Tele-
com presented a case study of the operations of its Corporate 
Citizenship Committee to the LEAD companies and also par -
ticipated in the discussion about the role of the Board in propa-
gating sustainability and in the publication of the guidelines. UN Global Compact
In October 2011, the company began to take part in the LEAD 
task force for strategic social investment and philanthropy. The 
results of the company’s activities will be presented at the “Rio 
+ 20 Sustainability Forum,” which will be held in Brazil in June 2012.
UNGC Korea Network Activities
Since the launch of the UNGC Korea Network in 2007, SK Tele-com has been attending the Steering Committee. In 2011, the 
company sponsored the successful 1st Global CSR Conference. 
The company also presented social enterprise as an effective private-public collaboration solution for the sustainable growth 
of underdeveloped countries at the first private forum of the 
High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness. At the 1st UNGC Value Awards, which was held by UNGC Korea Network for the first 
time, SK Telecom was recognized for its performance in pursu-
ing social innovation through ICT and received the Community Service Award. In 2012, the company is expected to collaborate 
in the development of future CSR leaders by taking part in the 
College Student Contest hosted by the Korea Network.

The UNGC Blueprint was declared at the UNGC headquarters 
in 2010 as a platform to encourage companies to implement 
sustainability in the midst of increasingly diverse and complex 
crises and opportunities. The Blueprint is divided into three ar -
eas: First, UNGC’s 10 principles are internalized in a company’s 
strategy and operations; second, a wide range of UN goals and 
issues are supported; and finally, the company joins the UN Global Compact. SK Telecom complies with the guidelines for 
these three areas, reflects the recommended principles in each 
area across its business activities, and plans on implementing them more extensively. Additionally, SK Telecom’s detailed ac-
tivities regarding the UNGC Blueprint are available at its web-

in each area of performance
·  Conduct an independent assessment of SK Telecom’s Report in 
relation to GRI Guidelines Application LevelsBSI Group Korea Limited (“BSI”) was commissioned by SK Telecom Co., Ltd. (“SK Telecom”) to perform an independence assurance on 
its 2011 Sustainability Report (“Report”), and the following is our assurance opinion:Assurance Opinion
Our Assurance Team reviewed a draft report and suggested its 
opinion, and the Report was revised if necessary. Based on the as-surance activity stated herein, our Assurance Team confirmed that 
SK Telecom’s Report complies with the Reporting Principle and suf-
ficiently states its sustainability performance.
Our team also confirmed that the GRI indicators specified on the 
GRI Index were either fully or partially, as a result of the Material-ity Analysis Process, reported. Our team confirmed that this Report 
meets the GRI G3.1 Guidelines at an Application Level of A+.
These assurance results were based on the three principles of 
AA1000 AS, namely, Inclusiveness, Materiality, and Responsive-ness, and the opinion on this Report is as follows:
Inclusiveness is a principle that guarantees stakeholder engage-
ment to develop and achieve responsible, strategic response to sustainability.
Our team confirmed that SK Telecom implements the pro-
cess of stakeholder engagement, accepts a variety of stakeholders’ opinions, and works hard to reflect them in its Sustainability Policy. That the company created a regular channel to communicate with 
each stakeholder group and set priorities on stakeholder surveys 
and feedback helped define the reporting content.
Materiality is a principle under which stakeholders determine 
the issues needed to make an informed decision on SK Telecom 
and its impacts. 
The team confirmed that sustainability issues identified 
by stakeholders through the Materiality Analysis and Defining Key Issues processes developed into the company’s Sustainability 
Strategy and its performance was reported. SK Telecom established its sustainability vision and strategy and has since 2008 operated the Corporate Citizenship Committee under the Board of Directors, through which the company established sustainability strategies for the five areas of Customer Relationship Management, Win-Win 
Partnerships, Community Involvement, Ethics Management, and 
Environmental Management, and implements a system to fulfill its promises to stakeholders and create real value. Responsiveness is a principle concerning the scope in which an 
organization responds to stakeholder issues. 
This Report clearly states in the Reporting Method center -
ing on the past key issues how the key issues proposed by stake-holders are connected to long-term sustainability strategy and 
what value is thereby created in order to clearly demonstrate what 
value sustainability strategy and activities can produce for stake-holders. The team believes that it will be effective to communicate minor topics that are not contained in this Report on a Web site.
Successes 
·  A system for integrating stakeholders’ key issues into the five 
areas of sustainability and managing them;
·  The activities of the Corporate Citizenship Committee under the 
Board of Directors, which demonstrate that sustainability activi-
ties can develop into a company’s long- and short-term strate-
gies
Recommendations for Improvement
·  We recommend that SK Telecom include targets, as well as past 
performance, so that its direction of policy with regard to sus-
tainability issues can be predicted. 
·  We recommend that SK Telecom identify issues in which perfor -
mance is not good enough to meet the goals and include a plan 
to resolve these issues in order to keep the Report balanced.
SK Telecom has faithfully practiced its corporate social responsi-
bility and created a number of values as a leading telecommu-
nications company in Korea, under its core value, “Pursuing the 
Long-term Sustainable Happiness of Stakeholders.” Our team believes that SK Telecom will work hard to continuously com-
municate with a variety of stakeholders concerning sustainabil-
ity activities and performance and become a global company respected by all stakeholders.

amount of greenhouse gas emissions generated in the publi-
cation process of paper reports.
Although SK Telecom does everything it can to minimize its 
environmental impact, paper reports still consume significant amounts of pulp and require a large amount of energy to 
both manufacture the paper and print the actual documents. 
As a result, two versions of this report have been issued: a 
paper version and an interactive PDF version. SK Telecom has 
plans in place to gradually increase the use of its interactive 
PDF files, as they provide more information than conven-
tional paper reports, which are more limited in space, while minimizing the company’s environmental impact at the same 
time. SK Telecom invites you to also play a role in conserving 
resources and protecting the environment by making use of 
the PDF version rather than the paper version of this report.As part of its environmental conservation efforts, the SK Tele-com 2011 Sustainability Report is printed on paper certified 
by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSCTM), and with soy ink 
made by a firm with FSCTM Chain of Custody certification 
(Trademark License Code : C005302). SK Telecom is also a willing participant in the Korea Energy Management Corpo-SK Telecom 2011 Sustainability Report
