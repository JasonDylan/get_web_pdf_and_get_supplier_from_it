Letter from the CEO
Growing Responsibly
At Skyworks, we are empowering the wireless networking revolution. Our highly innovative semiconductors continue to connect billions of people, places and things 
across a growing number of new and emerging applications. In 2018, the demand for ubiquitous connectivity again witnessed extraordinary growth, as it powered a 
vibrant and flourishing connected mobile economy. To meet our customers’ needs, we increased production and capacity at our factories around the world, and in doing 
so, delivered another year of record results.
We are proud that this growth did not come at the expense of our commitment to 
Sustainability. Rather, supported by our long-standing Sustainability policy, principles 
and supporting management systems, we drove further efficiencies and made significant 
improvements across key environmental, health and safety measures. We also took steps to 
increase the percentage of renewable energy we use to power our factories —achieving our 
highest levels of renewables to date.
Externally, we strengthened our relationships with key supply chain partners and maintained 
programs that hold them accountable to the same Sustainability standards to which we hold 
ourselves. As a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance, we also worked diligently 
to support Sustainable business practices throughout the industry. Finally, across the globe, 
our employees supported numerous local community outreach efforts, while our matching 
charitable contributions program provided financial support to causes important to our 
employees.
We are pleased with our accomplishments to date and look forward to continued future 
progress. As Skyworks continues to grow, our commitment to operating under sustainable 
business practices remains a cornerstone of our efforts, ensuring that we grow responsibly.

Skyworks' High Linearity WLAN Amplifiers Reduce Power Consumption  
The next generation of WLAN solutions from Skyworks have dramatically improved linear 
power and efficiency, enabling the transmission of signals with significantly higher data 
throughput. A direct result of these linearity improvements is a 
reduction in the amount of energy consumed per transmitted bit of 
information. From the figure below, there is a tenfold improvement 
in energy efficiency (reduced energy per bit) moving from 802.11a 
to 802.11ax or Wi-Fi 6, while enjoying a 200% increase in data 
throughput rate.
The improved device energy efficiency results in an annual savings of nearly 20 megawatts  
per one million users per year1.Skyworks has been enabling advancements in wireless connectivity for decades. As the demand for ubiquitous, “always-on” connectivity 
increases, our innovative, high performance analog semiconductors are enabling breakthrough communication platforms from global 
industry leaders – changing the way we live, work and play. Through our broad technology expertise and one of the most extensive 
product portfolios in the industry, we are connecting everyone and everything, all the time . 
Skyworks is a global company with engineering, marketing, operations, sales and support facilities located throughout  
Asia, Europe and North America and is a member of the S&P 500® and Nasdaq-100® market indices (NASDAQ: SWKS).

Sustainability Report 2018  |  52018 marked a highly successful year across all major environmental categories. As our overall production increased 
dramatically, so did our efficiency. Utilizing our established environmental management systems, improvement targets were 
set globally, as well as for each individual site locally. Sites initiated environmental improvement projects and performance 
was regularly measured and reported to management. This ongoing visibility helped us exceed established targets and achieve 
dramatic year-over-year improvements. 
Note: Commencing in 2017, Skyworks established a new baseline year to reflect the integration of our newer facilities in Japan 
and Singapore. Given updates and improvements made to the production unit calculation methodologies across all factories, 
the values in this year’s report, which includes all six of Skyworks’ worldwide manufacturing facilities, cannot be compared to 
values calculated prior to 2017.In 2018, Skyworks made a three-year purchase of 
Renewable Emissions Credits (RECs) totaling over  
93 million kWh of clean electricity. This annual offset of 
31 million kWh means Skyworks sourced approximately 
48% of the energy for its U.S. manufacturing facilities 
from clean energy sources.

6  | Sustainability Report 2018Supply Chain
| Supplier Responsibility
Skyworks partners with suppliers around the world to manufacture high-quality, low-cost products that meet our customers’ needs. Foundational to these partnerships are supplier 
commitments to operate according to sustainable business practices. Skyworks leverages the RBA® Code of Conduct and incorporates it into its Supplier Sustainability Specification, which 
requires that suppliers develop programs in conformance with these standards. www.skyworksinc.com/SuppliersDownloads .
Key Skyworks suppliers must undergo an onboarding process and periodic evaluation during which supplier conformance is verified. That process consists of:
1. Communication 
Sustainability requirements are communicated to our 
suppliers via the Supplier Sustainability Specification. 
Here, suppliers are informed of the obligations that all 
qualified supply chain partners must meet.
2. Qualification 
Suppliers are closely evaluated and qualified 
based on a strict set of criteria associated 
with product quality, performance, price, 
sustainability programs and more.
3. Identification
Major suppliers are identified. These suppliers represent 
80% of our expenditures and include subcontractor 
assembly facilities and labor agencies (i.e., recruiting 
companies).4. Risk Assessment 
All major suppliers complete an industry 
standardized Self-Assessment Questionnaire 
(SAQ) developed and implemented by the RBA®. 
Risk rankings are identified based on the SAQ 
scores.
5. Audit 
Supplier facilities that are ranked as high risk, in 
addition to any others specifically requested by 
Skyworks, must complete an on-site industry 
standard RBA® Validated Audit Process (VAP). 
VAP is a third-party, risk-based audit process 
where suppliers are objectively evaluated and their 
sustainability performance is scored.
6. Continuous Improvement 
Suppliers initiate corrective action plans (CAPs) 
for any issues identified in the VAP. Skyworks 
collaborates with its suppliers in tracking the CAPs 
to closure and provides further assistance at our 
supplier locations as needed.

| Understanding Our Global Supply Chain
As a global organization, Skyworks designs, develops and manufactures products around the world and is supported by an extensive supply chain network. Through these partnerships, we  
have a unique opportunity to amplify the reach of our sustainability programs and affect hundreds of facilities and thousands of employees. Our tier-one supply chain spans 17 countries and 
multiple regions, with 20 subcontracted product assembly facilities and 131 finished goods materials suppliers.8  | Sustainability Report 2018Supply Chain
| Responsible Minerals Sourcing
The metals tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold (referred to as 3TG) each remain integral to 
the manufacturing of semiconductor components. Certain areas of the world rich in 3TG are 
affected by violent conflict and rampant human rights abuses funded by the exploitation 
and trade of the 3TG mined in those regions. Skyworks intends to maintain a “conflict-
free” supply chain. In accordance with Conflict Minerals requirements enacted as part of 
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Skyworks has had a 
long-standing compliance program developed and implemented in accordance with the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance 
for Responsible Supply Chains.
Five-Step Framework for Risk-Based Due Diligence in the Mineral Supply Chain
| Our Policy
Skyworks is committed to the responsible sourcing of minerals. We have established programs 
aligned with the internationally recognized OECD due diligence framework6 to regularly 
evaluate our supply chain and require our suppliers to do the same. Suppliers are prohibited 
from supplying Skyworks with materials known to be derived from the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries that have not been confirmed as “DRC Conflict-Free” 
via a recognized and credible third-party process such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative’s 
Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP).
In 2018, Skyworks identified all of its suppliers of 3TG, receiving supply chain smelter / 
refiner disclosures from each. 100% of the identified smelters were verified to be audited and 
conformant to the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) as of December 31, 2018.
Identified Smelters % RMAP Conformant
Tantalum 39 100%
Tin 72 100%
Tungsten 38 100%
Gold 99 100%
Total 248 100%
Throughout 2018, Skyworks remained an active and participating member 
of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). The RMI was founded in 2008 
by members of the RBA® and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative to help 
companies make informed decisions on their supply chains. Skyworks 
utilizes the RMI’s flagship Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (which 
provides independent, third-party smelter / refiner audits) and works with 
our supply chain partners to drive towards a 100% RMAP audited and 
conformant supply chain.
6.  “OECD due diligence framework” refers to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s  
 guidance titled “OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict- 
 Affected and High-Risk Areas.”

The safety of our employees is of utmost importance. Skyworks operates all facilities in 
a responsible manner, providing safe and healthy working conditions. In keeping with this 
commitment, we maintain an Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) management system 
to ensure we consistently:
•  Remain in compliance with all applicable safety and health regulatory requirements
• Integrate safety considerations into strategic business decisions, engineering design, 
procurement, facilities management and production
• Cultivate safety responsibility by employees at all organization levels
• Promote continuous improvement of the OH&S management system and objectives
Skyworks continues to drive key initiatives globally. In 2018, an ergonomics early 
intervention pilot program was launched so that risk factors could be corrected to reduce the 
likelihood of injury where discomfort was reported early. A factory floor observation program 
was also introduced where immediate education on safe work methods was provided to 
workers to decrease the risk of injury. Skyworks used the data collected from different OH&S 
measures to further promote improvements across the organization creating a safe and 
healthy work environment.Health and Safety
