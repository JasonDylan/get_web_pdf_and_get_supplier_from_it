67  Performance DataINTRODUCTIONA Message from Our CEO
At MPC and MPLX, we are meeting the needs 
of today while investing in a sustainable, energy-
diverse future. Our approach to sustainability 
spans the environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) dimensions of our business. That means 
strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon 
intensity and conserving natural resources; innovating 
for the future by investing in renewables and 
emerging technologies; and embedding sustainability 
in decision-making and in how we engage our people 
and many stakeholders. 
In short, we are challenging 
ourselves to lead in 
sustainable energy.
A key component of meeting this challenge is our 
ongoing investment in lowering our carbon intensity. 
We have set a target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions intensity 30% below 2014 levels by 2030 
– a metric linked to compensation. And we have 
committed to reduce methane emissions intensity 
50% below 2016 levels by 2025, a move that further enhances the lower carbon profile of our growing 
natural gas business. As a result of our focus on 
energy efficiency, for the second straight year we 
were recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency with the ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year – 
Sustained Excellence award – the only company with 
fuels manufacturing as its primary business to earn 
this recognition.
The evolving energy landscape presents us with 
meaningful opportunities for innovation. Building on 
our existing renewables portfolio, we are advancing 
two exciting renewable fuels projects. In late 2020, 
we began production at our Dickinson, North Dakota, 
renewable diesel facility, the second largest of its 
kind in the United States, and are progressing the 
conversion of our Martinez, California, refinery to a 
renewable diesel facility. We are also leveraging value 
chain opportunities to lower the carbon intensity of 
these products through renewable electricity, lower 
carbon-intensity feedstocks, and carbon capture, 
utilization and sequestration. 
Our commitment to conserving natural resources 
is reflected in our goal to reduce our freshwater 
withdrawal intensity 20% below 2016 levels by 
2030. Our year-over-year reductions in criteria 
pollutant emissions and waste generation also show 
continuous improvement in this area. 
In 2020, our teams demonstrated strong safety 
and environmental performance, including a nearly 
40% reduction in the most significant process 
safety events and a 40% reduction in designated 
environmental incidents over 2019. Our personal 
safety performance continues to be better than 
industry average for the U.S. refining and midstream 
sectors.In a year marked by extraordinary challenges 
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, creating 
shared value with our many stakeholders took on 
deeper meaning. We expanded our reach to assist 
with the increased demands surrounding remote 
learning and basic needs through our Community 
Investment program and increased our company 
match of employee giving from 60% to 100%. 
Our comprehensive approach to stakeholder 
engagement also included closely engaging with tribal 
communities across our operational footprint and 
working with our suppliers to advance supply chain 
sustainability and adherence to our Supplier Code of 
Conduct. 
To sharpen our focus on making sustainability 
pervasive in all we do, we include an ESG metric in 
our employee bonus programs, weighted at 20%. We 
recently introduced a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
component – making us the first U.S. independent 
downstream energy company to link improving 
diversity to compensation, in the same way we led 
the industry in linking GHG intensity reductions to our 
compensation. We are encouraged by the recognition 
of our progress – with inclusion in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index, the Forbes Just 100 list, and 
a 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign 
Corporate Equality Index.
Thank you for your interest in MPC and MPLX.

we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable 
energy, and we welcome your thoughts at

INTRODUCTIONImportance to society
Business impact Identification of Material1 Reporting Topics
In determining the content for our 
report, we conducted a materiality 
assessment to prioritize the 
environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) reporting topics that are most 
important to our stakeholders and to our 
business. Consistent with Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Core 
reporting guidelines, we focus on topics 
that reflect significant ESG impacts 
and enable stakeholders to assess our 
company performance.
We engaged both external and 
internal stakeholders to understand 
their perspectives on a broad range 
of identified topics. We combined 
the information gathered from these 
engagements with insights from 
industry benchmarking, governmental 
regulations, voluntary initiatives and 
analysis of online news and social 
media trends to create a more nuanced 
understanding of priority reporting 
topics. To accomplish this, we utilized 
Datamaran®, a digital tool that uses real-
time data and artificial intelligence to 
track meta trends and issue relevance 
over time. The insights and analysis 
described above resulted in a list of 
significant reporting topics for MPC  
and MPLX.

We are committed to lowering the carbon intensity 
of our operations and the products we process; 
improving the energy efficiency of our operations; 
and working with others to improve energy 
efficiency within the manufacturing, consumer and 
transportation sectors.

 Tangible pathway to meet target
 Committed to evaluate and update target as 
demand and technologies evolveOur GHG Emissions
Our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction 
performance is an indicator of how efficiently we 
operate our facilities and our reduction target drives 
us to implement initiatives that reduce the GHG 
emissions intensity of our company. While we include 
an overview of our GHG program and metrics in this 
report, additional detail, including climate change 
risks and opportunities, can be found in our annual 
Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios report. 
Our GHG emissions intensity reduction target 
encompasses both Scope 1 emissions — direct 
emissions from our operations — and Scope 2 
emissions — indirect emissions from the electricity 
and steam we purchase to support our business 
activities.
The primary ambition of the Paris Agreement is to 
limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius 
compared to pre-industrial levels. Our investments in 
lower-carbon businesses over the past decade, along 
with our GHG emissions intensity reduction target, 
are advancing a business model that is progressively 
lowering our carbon intensity over time.
This year in our performance data table, we have 
included an estimate of the Scope 3 emissions from 
the products we process and market. We also plan 
to provide the information in our report to the CDP 
later this year, so that investors and stakeholders have 
an additional avenue to access our data. For more 
information on our approach to reporting Scope 3 
emissions, please see pages 7-8 of the Perspectives 
on Climate-Related Scenarios report. 29.9

Consistent with our GHG emissions intensity reduction 
target, we employ a risk-based capital allocation 
process that assigns higher return-on-investment (ROI) 
thresholds for business segments and projects with 
greater financial and regulatory uncertainty than those 
with more stable cash flow and less regulatory risk. 
The ROI thresholds are highest in refining where high 
carbon pricing and market uncertainty impose more 
risk. As part of our major project planning process, we 
now include an assessment of project GHG emissions 
intensity and any potential impact to our company GHG 
emissions intensity reduction target.
This process is driving capital investment and decision-
making consistent with a lower carbon future. For 
example, over 40% of growth capital in our 2021 
budget is directed toward increasing our production of 
renewable fuels, lowering MPC's carbon intensity. We 
also incorporate energy and GHG management into 
project design, so that our collective growth projects 
support our 2030 goal.

5 refineries 
earn U.S. EPA’s ENERGY STAR® 
certifications in one year  Focus on Energy
Second consecutive year  
Only refining company to 
have the elite “Partner of the 
Year”  designationENERGY EFFICIENCY
MPLX continues to implement a formalized 
energy-efficiency program to drive 
improvements. 
Smart-Start Vapor Recovery  
MPLX terminals utilize vapor recovery 
units (VRUs) to recover vapors from trucks 
as they are loaded with fuel. Continuous 
emission monitors equipped with smart-
start processing equipment allow the VRUs 
to operate only while loading, saving power 
and decreasing emissions. Utilizing 77 VRUs 
across MPLX terminals, we avoided 18,400 
tonnes of CO2 in 2020.
EPA’s SmartWay® Program  
As a partner company in EPA’s SmartWay 
Transport program, we use assessment tools 
to track the GHG emissions intensity of our 
tanker trucks to help us find opportunities to 
become more efficient. In 2020, we continued 
to improve our transportation efficiency, 
resulting in a 4% increase in miles per gallon 
and a 4% reduction in CO2 grams per mile 
since 2017 . In the past decade, our Focus on Energy program 
helped us avoid the equivalent of 1 .8 billion Btu/hr of 
energy use, or roughly the same amount of energy 
used by about 100,000 homes in one year. The 
program’s cost savings are approximately $500 million.
Recognized for Improved Energy Efficiency
For the second consecutive year, MPC has earned 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA ’s) 
ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year — Sustained 
Excellence Award, the highest honor among ENERGY 
STAR awards.
INCREASING 
EFFICIENCY THROUGH 
COGENERATION
An effective way to increase efficiency is through 
cogeneration, a process that simultaneously 
produces electricity while capturing useful heat or 
steam for industrial uses. Replacing lower-efficiency 
boilers and deploying Combined Heat and Power 
(CHP) systems reduces the emissions intensity at 
our facilities. Five of our facilities have CHP systems 
that cogenerate electricity and steam. These 
facilities have avoided millions of tonnes of GHG 
emissions since they were installed.MPC is the only company with fuels manufacturing 
as its primary business to earn the award, which 
recognizes the company for sustained, top-tier energy 
efficiency and excellent environmental compliance. 
The EPA reserves the award’s Sustained Excellence 
designation for partners like MPC that have already 
received ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year recognition 
for a minimum of two consecutive years, and then 
continue to go above and beyond the criteria needed 
to qualify for the award.
One contributing factor to MPC’s recognition is its 
industry-leading performance in ENERGY STAR 
certifications, which recognize a facility for:
 Meeting the EPA ’s strict energy efficiency 
performance criteria
 Demonstrating excellent environmental compliance
 Achieving energy efficiency that places it in the top 
25% of similar facilities nationwideOverall, MPC’s refineries have earned more 
certifications than all other refining companies 
combined.
Four MPLX terminals achieved the U.S. EPA ’s 
ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry award in 2020: 
Nashville Downtown and 51st, Nashville, Tennessee; 
Youngstown, Ohio; and Charleston, West Virginia. 
Their actions reduced costs and emissions of 
greenhouse gases at the terminals.Five of MPC’s refineries earned individual ENERGY 
STAR certifications from the EPA in 2020: Anacortes, 
Washington; Garyville, Louisiana; Robinson, Illinois;  
St. Paul Park, Minnesota; and Canton, Ohio.

STRENGTHEN RESILIENCYMethane Emissions 
Intensity Reduction Target
We have established MPLX’s “Focus on 
Methane” program as a holistic approach to 
voluntarily reduce methane emissions along all 
aspects of MPLX’s natural gas gathering and 
processing operations.
T arget:  Reduce MPLX 
methane emissions 
intensity 50% by 2025 
from 2016 levels50%
WHY A METHANE 
REDUCTION GOAL?
Natural gas, which consists primarily of methane, 
emits half the carbon dioxide of coal when used 
to generate electricity.
Given this significant advantage, coal-to-gas 
switching for power generation is one of the best 
“quick win” strategies that can be employed 
to reduce near-term GHG emissions. Our 
commitment to voluntarily reduce methane 
emissions maximizes the climate benefits of 
natural gas investments. Pneumatic control valves:  Over 80% of our more 
than 25,000 pneumatic controllers are powered by 
compressed air, meaning they are not a source of 
methane. For the remaining gas-driven controllers 
we plan to replace the remaining ~300 high-
bleed controllers by the end of 2022 and begin 
implementing a program to either convert ~3,000 
intermittent bleed controllers to low bleed or 
compressed air or implement an LDAR program to 
assure performance. 
 Pipeline launchers and receivers: As part of 
an agreement with U.S. EPA, we developed 
proprietary technology to minimize emissions from 
pipeline launchers and receivers. MPLX shared its 
solutions with nearly 1,000 people via in-person 
trainings, and our royalty-free patents are available 
on the MPLX website .
 Fugitive LDAR:  Currently, approximately 25% of 
our 180 compressor stations are being monitored 
under existing LDAR programs. We plan to 
implement LDAR programs at the remaining 
compressor stations by 2023.
 Compressor rod packing:  We have completed 
trials to reduce emissions from compressor rod 
packing using a low-emission packing material and 
installing vent flow measurement. Over the next 
three years we will expand the use of this design 
across the business as part of routine rod packing 
replacements. 
 Maintenance venting:  We are optimizing 
necessary maintenance venting and blowdowns 
to reduce emissions going to the atmosphere, 
including using vapor recovery units and/or 
portable flares.

STRENGTHEN RESILIENCYConserving Natural Resources
To meet society's current and future energy needs, 
we must do our part as responsible stewards of the 
environment we all share. 
We recognize that our business activities can 
impact the ecosystems and communities in which 
we operate and that these must be managed and 
mitigated. 
Safety and Environmental Stewardship is one of our 
core values. We are committed to minimizing our 
environmental impact and reducing our footprint 
through advanced practices and investments that 
conserve natural resources.
In 2020, we spent $630 million, 
or 23% of our capital spend 
(excluding acquisitions) on 
environmental expenditures 
to improve the environmental 
performance of our assets.Enhanced Accountability 
through Environmental 
Management
Beginning in 2020, 100% of our company is in 
scope of our Operational Excellence Management 
System (OEMS), which is third-party reviewed for 
alignment with RC14001®. Our commitment to 
RC14001® ensures that we follow our environmental 
stewardship policies, which include responsibilities 
to assess, minimize and reduce our environmental 
impact and communicate with stakeholders about 
the environmental impacts of our products and 
operations. 
Designated Environmental Incidents 
The Designated Environmental Incidents (DEI) 
metric is an internal indicator to track our spills, 
environmental permit exceedances and agency 
enforcement actions. We use four DEI tiers to 
measure severity, with Tiers 1 and 2 being the 
least severe. We consider these leading indicators 
of potential problems that can be mitigated and 
addressed proactively, compared to the more severe 
Tier 3 and 4 DEIs.
PRIORITY AREAS
At MPC, in addition to our extensive work on lowering the GHG emissions intensity of our operations and products, we emphasize these priority areas for 
conserving natural resources:20172016 39

STRENGTHEN RESILIENCYBiodiversity
MPC and MPLX employ multiple proactive measures to protect 
plant and animal species and preserve their natural habitats. 
Our OEMS provides the procedural framework to ensure we 
account for the potential effects of our activities on ecosystems 
and prepare necessary mitigation procedures. Our approach

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
1 The Mitigation Hierarchy is a framework, established by the International Finance 
Corporation's Performance Standard 6, to aid development projects in preparation 
for impacts and aim to achieve no net loss of biodiversity. The Hierarchy follows 
avoidance, minimization, restoration and offsets in order to reduce development 
impacts and control any negative effects on the environment. COMMITMENT TO 
BIODIVERSITY 
 As one of our core values, we are 
steadfast in our commitment to 
environmental protection, stewardship 
and conservation efforts. 
 When executing projects and operations, 
we apply a similar approach to that of 
the Mitigation Hierarchy1 to identify and 
assess ways to first avoid, then minimize 
or offset impacts to biodiversity.
 Through the environmental focus of our 
formal and informal risk assessments, 
we seek to avoid proposed activities 
with the potential for negative impacts 
in ecologically sensitive areas. Early 
engagement with communities and local, 
state and federal government agencies 
informs project planning. 
 Our various policies and processes are 
designed to protect the environmental 
quality of the habitats in and around our 
operations. We are mindful that operating 
within communities is a privilege, and we 
work to continually identify and minimize 
any impacts our operations may have on 
the public and the environment.

STRENGTHEN RESILIENCYNEWBURY  
RIFFLE DESIGN
During new pipeline construction, our priority is 
to avoid ecologically sensitive areas by seeking 
engineering solutions, such as rerouting around 
the area or boring under the resource. When land 
disturbance in these areas is unavoidable, we use a 
variety of recognized best management practices and 
techniques to mitigate our impacts throughout the 
pipeline’s life cycle, including: 
 Developing our construction schedules to avoid 
species migration, spawning, nesting and other 
activities 
 Restoring all disturbed areas to pre-construction 
conditions by seeding/hydroseeding with 
appropriate seed mixes 
 Adhering to Weed Management Plans to ensure 
previously disturbed areas remain free of noxious 
weeds Protecting Biodiversity throughout the Pipeline Life Cycle 
For several maintenance projects, MPLX has 
collaborated with governmental agencies 
to employ the leading-edge Newbury Riffle 
Design to enhance biodiversity habitat while 
providing pipeline protection at waterway 
crossings. Rock is placed within the streambed 
at a predetermined slope to reduce erosion and 
promote fish and aquatic organism passage. 
The installation of artificial riffles also increases 
habitat for some macroinvertebrates.   
 Conducting post-construction surveys to ensure 
sensitive areas have been appropriately restored 
 Monitoring wetland and waterway crossing 
sites to confirm they are fully restored and 
functioning 
 T raining employees and contractors about 
maintaining pipeline rights of way in sensitive areas 
 Using signage to indicate sensitive areas 
In situations where restoration cannot be achieved, 
impacts to sensitive areas are offset in several ways, 
including purchasing mitigation credits through 
approved mitigation banking sources or using other 
mechanisms to provide perpetual protection to other 
similarly ecologically sensitive properties. Our policies and practices for pipeline siting, construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning 
are aligned with the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standards on Environmental and 
Social Sustainability1.

STRENGTHEN RESILIENCYProtecting Endangered Species 
Texas Hornshell Mussel 
Due to the location and growth of our pipeline assets in the Permian Basin of West 
Texas, we have voluntarily entered into a conservation agreement with the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, the BLM, and the nonprofit conservation organization 
CEHMM to protect the endangered Texas Hornshell Mussel. 
As a part of this agreement, we remain cognizant of the Texas Hornshell Mussel 
and take appropriate mitigation actions to protect their habitats throughout the 
life cycle of our assets. For example, we conduct boom deployment drills and 
exercises along the Pecos River to practice spill response tactics that best protect 
the species. 
Brack’s Fishhook and Brack Hardwall Cactus  
In 2016, we engaged with the BLM and other agencies to determine the optimal 
route for a new pipeline project in northwest New Mexico. The route that was 
agreed upon impacted endangered Brack’s Fishhook and Brack Hardwall cacti, as 
they were deemed unavoidable. 
Partnering with biologists at San Juan College, we determined how to mitigate 
risks our construction project may have on the cacti. As a result, the cacti were 
transplanted using a nontraditional method while dormant to two other locations 
where they are known to exist. Biologists monitored the transplanted cacti for five 
years (2016-2020) and collected data on the health status, threats and trends of the 
transplants. 
Data collected from monitoring the cacti will allow the BLM to establish 
management measures and policy to better protect this species from future 
threats and to determine if transplanting is a viable option for future vegetation 
disturbing activities.
Eastern Hellbender and Freshwater Mussels 
During a recent pipeline maintenance project in northeast Ohio, we partnered with 
the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to protect and enhance habitat for 
listed threatened and endangered species. 
We planted trees to provide a riparian buffer to Bull Creek and offset temporary 
impacts caused by the pipeline project on the state-listed scenic waterway. 
Freshwater mussels within the project footprint were moved upstream. 
We also funded the installation of seven hellbender huts to create habitat for the 
Eastern hellbender. The huts were then placed in active restoration locations.PARTNERING TO PROTECT 
BIODIVERSITY 
Wildlife Habitat Council 
The Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) is the only voluntary sustainability 
standard designed for broad-based biodiversity enhancement and 
conservation education activities on corporate landholdings. We 
actively participate in habitat certification and carry out community 
education, engagement programs and partnerships. 
Pollinator Partnership 
The Pollinator Partnership is the largest nonprofit organization 
dedicated exclusively to the health, protection and conservation of 
all pollinating animals. Our Robinson refinery was awarded the 2020 
Monarch Sustainer of the Year by the Pollinator Partnership. The award 
recognizes a U.S. business that has shown exceptional leadership and 
action in providing habitat and awareness for monarchs along their 
migratory corridors. This is the second time that our Robinson refinery 
has been recognized. In total, there are seven sites where we conduct 
monarch-enhancing work through the Pollinator Partnership.

STRENGTHEN RESILIENCYSpill Prevention
At MPC and MPLX, the safety of our employees, 
contractors, communities and the environment is our 
top priority. Our commitment to safety — including spill 
prevention — has remained as strong as ever during the 
pandemic. Acting quickly to put the proper precautions 
in place allowed our employees to continue the safe and 
reliable operations of our assets. LAND — Maintaining Pipeline Integrity
24/7 Pipeline Monitoring
Highly trained personnel monitor 
pipeline pressure, flow and volume 
24 hours a day, seven days a week. Leak Detection Technology 
Sensors and gauges on pipelines detect 
drops in pressure or changes in flow 
rate and notify personnel of changes. 
In-line Inspection (ILI) Tools
ILI tools travel through pipelines, 
scanning and measuring a pipe’s walls 
for signs of dents, corrosion or cracking. Corrosion Control 
Protective coating that resists corrosion 
is applied to the outside of pipelines and 
storage tanks. Cathodic protection systems, 
which send small electric currents through 
the soil, are installed along pipeline routes 
to help prevent external corrosion. 
Above-Ground Inspections 
Pipeline routes are visually inspected 
by air and/or by ground patrols to 
check for land disturbances, such as 
unauthorized digging and erosion, and 
pipeline leaks. 
Waterway Crossing 
Inspections
High-resolution sonar equipment is 
used to inspect pipelines under water 
to determine how erosion and water 
channel changes may impact the pipe. Pipeline Safety Engagement
We educate landowners, first 
responders and community partners 
near our pipelines on safe digging 
practices and emergency response. Geohazard Modeling
Geohazards such as landslides represent 
a significant threat to pipeline integrity. 
To combat this, models are developed to 
predict the amount of land movement at a 
location and whether the movement will 
impact the pipeline. PIPELINE SPILL-PREVENTION 
TECHNOLOGY 
Across MPLX we continue to make significant 
investments to improve pipeline in-line inspection and 
assessment technology programs. The combination 
of state-of-the-art pipeline inspection technology and 
advanced analysis techniques have been implemented 
to ensure the continued safety of the public and 
environment.
We are also analyzing and piloting ways to capture 
right-of-way imagery using cameras attached to aerial 
patrol aircraft. We have identified multiple opportunities 
to leverage this imagery in conjunction with computer 
visualization techniques to detect potential integrity 
threats such as geohazards, high-risk agricultural 
activities, new encroachments and spills.
In 2020, Marathon Pipe Line LLC (MPL), a wholly 
owned subsidiary of MPLX, began developing 
computer vision models to detect potential integrity 
threats by harnessing artificial intelligence and machine 
learning. This technology can identify hard to detect 
leaks by leveraging the existing in-station operational 
cameras that monitor many pipeline facilities. 
MPL has an expansive Unmanned Aircraft Systems 
(UAS) fleet with 45 UAS and 30 certified pilots. 
Currently, MPL uses UAS to capture project work, 
conduct assessments during emergency response, 
and complete inspections along our rights of way, 
water crossings and within facilities. In 2020, MPL 
utilized UAS and Geographic information system 
resources to calculate secondary containment 
volumes to increase accuracy in spill response 
planning.

FOR EXCELLENCE 
In 2020, MPLX’s Terminal organization was named the silver winner of 
the U.S. Coast Guard’s biennial Rear Admiral William M. Benkert Marine 
Environmental Award for Excellence, and our Marine organization was 
named an honorable mention. The award recognizes corporations and 
businesses involved in marine facility or vessel operations that have 
demonstrated sustained excellence and outstanding achievement in 
protecting the marine environment. It also encourages innovations in 
operations, pollution prevention and response, environmental outreach 
and partnerships and provides a means for award recipients to share their 
successful methods and techniques with others in the industry.Vessel General Permit 
Inspections
Deck areas of vessels and barges are 
inspected daily. 
Spill Kit Inspections
Every six months we visually inspect all the 
contents of every spill kit to ensure they 
are intact and ready to use. Spill Valves
The majority of our barges are equipped 
with spill valves designed to prevent a 
catastrophic failure if a barge has become 
over-pressurized, and we are evaluating 
expanding use of this technology. Training
We require our tankermen to assist 
on 10 loads and 10 discharges before 
conducting barge transfers unassisted as 
a credentialed mariner. That is twice as 
rigorous as regulations require. 
Double-Hulled Barges  
and Vessels
All of our barges used for river transport of raw 
materials and refined products are double-hulled. 
All new vessels entering or operating in U.S. 
waters are also double-hulled and existing vessels 
are either double-hulled or appropriately retrofitted.Deck Coaming and Drip Pan 
Containments
Approximately 98% of our barges are equipped 
with special drip pan containments that exceed 
regulatory requirements for barges. Drip pan 
containments capture spills before they enter 
rivers and other bodies of water.

STRENGTHEN RESILIENCYEmergency Preparedness 
Robust preparedness is essential to ensuring we can 
respond effectively should an emergency event occur. 
Consistently investing in our response capabilities 
equips us to mitigate and manage the impact in the 
event of an incident. We strive to perfect our initial 
response to an incident, which is critical to limiting the 
impacts on people and the environment. 
All our operating locations have emergency response 
teams and site-specific emergency preparedness 
and response plans tailored to the risks they may 
encounter. These location-specific plans are subject to 
regular drills to ensure proper execution in the event 
of an actual incident. 
Several agencies review and approve our plans, 
including the EPA, the U.S. Coast Guard and 
the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA). 
MPC’s Emergency Preparedness Group (EPG) 
supports local teams by overseeing our response 
program and making sure we can respond rapidly and 
appropriately to an emergency incident anywhere 
we operate. The EPG staff coordinates with business 
components to share best practices and resources 
across the company. 
For incidents that may require resources beyond 
those available at a local facility, our EPG maintains 
a Corporate Emergency Response Team (CERT). 
It comprises approximately 250 employees with 
response expertise and training in the Incident 
Command System (ICS), a globally recognized 
organizational structure designed to integrate 
resources across multiple agencies and organizations, 
should an emergency event occur. Tiered Response System: 
Tier 1 Incidents are directed by a local response team
Tier 2Incidents are directed by a district/regional response 
team
Tier 3Incidents are larger in scope and complexity and 
directed by the Corporate Emergency Response Team
Consistent Training and Improvement 
To maintain readiness, our CERT members and other 
emergency response personnel participate in various 
exercises and work alongside federal, state and local 
responders, such as the EPA, the U.S. Coast Guard, 
state environmental protection or wildlife agencies 
and local emergency responders.
MPC and MPLX maintain an emergency response 
exercise program to test and continually improve our 
response capabilities:  Our exercises follow the guidelines of the federal 
government’s National Preparedness for Response 
Exercise Program (PREP), which meets the 
requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and all 
federal, state, and local requirements. 
 Exercises not only help prepare for emergency 
situations, but are also used to review, critique and 
improve our emergency response plans. 
 We take a collaborative approach to emergency 
preparedness. In addition to training our 
own employees and contractors, we engage 
federal, state, local and tribal agencies, local fire 
departments and other first responders, and 
community members who have an interest in the 
design and development of our plans and exercises.
In 2020, we adjusted our approach for drills and 
exercises to align with protocols in place for the 
COVID-19 pandemic and completed all required 
exercises.
APPLYING TECHNOLOGY TO 
OIL SPILL RESPONSE 
Due to remote working, social distancing and 
health precautions put in place due to COVID-19, 
MPC and MPLX worked with a variety of federal, 
state, local, and tribal agencies to find new and 
creative ways to use technology for oil spill 
response exercises.
We held multiple exercises via a “virtual command 
post. ” These exercises incorporated video feeds 
on field deployment activities using drone videos, 
FaceTime and smart helmet technology. They also 
fostered effective collaboration with participants, 
observers, stakeholders and evaluators to ensure 
responders maintain proficiency in their response 
planning and execution.

STRENGTHEN RESILIENCYWaste
An important aspect of environmental stewardship 
is to actively manage waste. Our environmental 
engineers work with designated operations planners 
to minimize the waste we generate, and to recycle or 
beneficially reuse as much of the waste as possible. 
We carefully contain and label drums, boxes, bins and 
roll-off containers of waste, send our waste materials 
to properly permitted waste disposal and recycling 
facilities, and verify their track record of compliance 
with state and federal waste regulations. 
The volume of waste we generate in any given 
year varies significantly, depending on scheduled 
maintenance and remediation activities. 
All potential nonhazardous and hazardous waste 
vendors must first be vetted and approved by our 
corporate environmental department. In selecting 
waste vendors, we use a structured process to 
determine environmental compliance and verify 
that our waste materials are disposed of legally and 
responsibly.Energy Recovery
From Hazardous Waste to Cement
We partner with CIRCON Environmental to convert 
oil tank waste to cement. As refinery tanks are 
cleaned, the residual material is removed, placed in 
secure waste containers and trucked to a cement 
kiln for processing into waste-derived fuel. Since 
2013, approximately 95,800 tonnes of waste from our 
refineries has become an alternative fuel source for 
the cement industry, avoiding approximately 230,000 
tonnes of CO2e emissions.
Historically, the primary fuel firing cement kilns 
has been coal. The waste-derived fuel blend from 
our waste reduces the amount of coal the cement 
manufacturer would otherwise need to use in its 
process. In addition, sand sediment, iron scale or 
other material in the fuel blend contributes to the 
cement product. By turning our wastes into fuel and 
cement, the cement manufacturers have reduced 
their coal use by over 60,000 tonnes. In 2020, more 
than 2 million gallons of waste-derived fuel was sent 
to cement kilns, which kept 5,650 tonnes of waste 
out of landfills, and avoided approximately 27 ,000 
tonnes of CO2e emissions. 
Recycling 
Catalyst Metals Reclamation
Catalysts are an important part of fuels 
manufacturing, facilitating a variety of critical chemical 
processes. In 2020, in lieu of landfill disposal, we 
delivered over 5,800 tonnes of spent catalyst to 
a recycler that extracted the vanadium and other 
valuable metals to produce ferrovanadium and a 
ferronickel molybdenum alloy, which are sold to the 
steel industry. This reclamation process avoided 
nearly 50,100 metric tonnes of CO2e emissions when 
compared to mining for virgin ore.2020 Hazardous Waste Disposal

MPC and MPLX strive to actively manage and monitor 
water use throughout all operations. Responsibly 
managing the use and sourcing of fresh water is 
especially critical in water-stressed regions in the U.S. 
We continually evaluate opportunities to reduce and 
manage our use of this shared resource, and to further 
our commitment to water conservation, we voluntarily 
set a companywide target to reduce freshwater 
withdrawal intensity by more than 20% by 2030 from 
2016 levels.

California; El Paso, Texas; Martinez, California; and 
Gallup, New Mexico – were in water-stressed regions, 
as defined by the Global Reporting Initiative and World 
Resources Institute assessment tools. By indefinitely 
idling our Gallup refinery in mid-2020, this decreased

Total CO emissions Total VOC emissions
Total PM10 emissionsAir Quality and Emissions 
Our commitment to improving air quality begins at 
our facilities and extends to the transportation fuels 
we produce. 
We have a comprehensive approach to improving 
air quality that targets lowering emissions of criteria 
pollutants by producing cleaner fuels, reducing gas 
flaring and minimizing fugitive emissions.
Companywide Criteria Pollutant Emissions  
(thousand tonnes)
1 As defined by the U.S. EPA.HOW WE AIM TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY
1. Producing Cleaner Fuels
Across the country, MPC refineries produce low-
sulfur Tier 3 gasoline, a cleaner burning fuel that 
could reduce emissions by up to 80%1 in vehicles of 
model year 2017 and newer, and up to 13%1 in older 
models. This emission reduction ultimately improves 
air quality.
2. Reducing Gas Flaring 
Avoidance of flaring is a key priority. Our refineries 
implement flare reduction programs that help 
prevent flaring while recovering gases and enabling 
effective combustion, if gases must be flared. In 
addition, flare gas recovery systems return gas to 
the refining process instead of flaring, reducing 
criteria pollutant emissions and GHG emissions. 
3. Minimizing Fugitive Emissions
Acoustic imaging cameras, also known as FLUKE® 
Imagers, are used to quickly and accurately locate 
air, gas and vacuum leaks in compressed air 
systems — even in noisy environments. These 
devices use extremely sensitive microphones to 
detect sounds both in the human hearing range and 
the ultrasonic range. 
Initially they were used to identify air leaks at our 
compressor stations and gas plants. They are now 
being used to identify process leaks and methane 
leaks and may be used to confirm repairs are 
effective. 
Optical imaging cameras, also known as FLIR 
cameras, are used across our operations to scan 
equipment for potential leak sources and make any 
necessary repairs.From 2002 through 2020,  
we have achieved a

26Renewables and Emerging Technologies
We are committed to meeting the world’s growing 
energy needs while reducing carbon emissions 
intensity and pursuing lower carbon opportunities. 
Key objectives include: 
 Increase the volume of renewable fuels we 
produce and market
 Seek ways to expand the use of renewable 
energy in our operations
 Innovate and deploy advanced technologies that 
reduce environmental impact while enhancing 
business performance 
In 2020, we delivered approximately 2.1 billion 
gallons of renewable fuels to consumers, just 
over 300 million gallons of which we produced, 
including biodiesel and ethanol. This 2.1 billion 
gallon volume avoided nearly 9 million tonnes of 
customers’ CO2 transportation emissions. This 
was a slight decrease from 2019 due to lower 
blended volumes of renewables resulting from 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the next five 
years, MPC expects to increase renewable fuels 
production from just over 300 million gallons per 
year to nearly 1 .2 billion gallons per year.
This will be achieved, in part, by converting 
petroleum refineries into renewable diesel 
facilities. In 2020, we completed the conversion of 
our 19,000 bpd Dickinson, North Dakota, refinery 
into a 12,000 bpd renewable diesel production 
facility. The Dickinson facility is currently the 
second largest renewable diesel production facility 
operating in the U.S. This is also a good example 
of using existing assets and workforce to support 
investment in an energy-diverse future.
We are also progressing the conversion of our 
161,000 bpd Martinez, California, refinery into a 
48,000 bpd renewable diesel production facility. 
When complete, the Martinez facility will be larger 
than any renewable diesel production facility

INNOVATE FOR THE FUTUREMartinez Renewable Fuels Project
We are repositioning our Martinez 
refinery to become Martinez Renewable 
Fuels, a renewable fuels manufacturing 
and terminal facility that will be able 
to produce approximately 730 million 
gallons of renewable fuels per year.  
The Martinez facility is expected to start 
producing renewable diesel and other 
renewable fuels in 2022, with a build to 
full capacity in 2023. 
MPC estimates its conversion of the 
Martinez facility from petroleum refining 
to renewable fuels production will reduce 
the facility’s manufacturing greenhouse 
gas emissions by 60%, total criteria 
pollutant emissions by 70% and water 
use by 1 billion gallons every year.

Additional information about the Martinez Renewable Fuels project can 
be found on its website, MarathonMartinezRenewables.com.MPC entered into a memorandum of understanding 
(MOU) with Southwest Airlines Co. in early 2021 that  
is intended to facilitate the development and production  
of commercialized sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).  
Air transport will continue to be one of the primary ways 
people build connections with each other and the world 
around them, and how goods are moved rapidly around 
the world. SAF is a way to lower the carbon intensity 
of these critical activities. MPC is currently providing 
renewable diesel to the California fuels market, and 
conversion of our Martinez refinery to renewable fuels 
production will enable us to augment that supply. Our permitting process for the project includes discussion 
of possible future uses, and SAF is part of that discussion. 
Our MOU with Southwest includes a variety of 
possibilities toward increasing SAF production:
 Advocating for policies that would support affordable, 
reliable SAF availability
 Working together to advance research and 
development that would help commercialize and lower 
the carbon intensity of SAF
 Collaborating to raise public awareness of SAF’s 
benefits to society

Virent, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of MPC, is creating alternatives 
to petroleum-based products by 
developing the chemicals and fuels 
the world demands using a wide 
range of naturally occurring, renewable 
resources.Virent is working to commercialize its 
BioForming® Platform for converting biobased 
feedstocks into low-carbon renewable 
fuels and chemicals. Using a novel catalytic 
process, Virent’s technology converts sugar 
from the carbohydrate portion of plants into 
fossil-free products. 
Its BioForm® gasoline has been approved 
by the EPA for blending in gasoline up to 
45%, while its BioForm® SAK (Synthesized  
Aromatic Kerosene) jet fuel has proven to 
reduce particulate emissions at altitude 
through flight testing and engine performance 
monitoring. It is also developing technology to 
produce hydrogen from sugar and glycerol.
In addition to fuels, the process produces 
bio-paraxylene, a key raw material for 
renewable polyester fibers and packaging, 
and bio-benzene, a raw material for renewable 
plastics, detergents and packaging.
Virent’s process can utilize a variety of 
carbohydrate feedstocks, including agriculture 
and forestry wastes and plant sugars like 
corn, sugar cane and beet. This optionality 
allows for responsiveness to commodity 
markets, avoids competition with oilseed 
and protein feedstocks, and provides further 
opportunities for growth and deployment.
Virent also offers the potential for net-zero or 
carbon negative fuels and chemicals through 
value chain optimization utilizing wind, solar, 
carbon capture and sequestration, renewable 
natural gas, blue/green hydrogen and 
regenerative agriculture. 
With well-demonstrated technology, a strong

Our Commitment to Our People 
Our people are our greatest asset and essential to 
the success of our business. We believe in providing 
a collaborative and safe work environment that 
embraces diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) to 
ensure we attract, develop and retain the best talent. 
Providing opportunities for long-term engagement 
and career growth are top priorities. We want our 
employees to feel that they are valued for their work 
and impact on the business, that we reward them 
fairly and competitively, and that we are invested in 
their development. 
The COVID-19 pandemic challenged us in ways we 
could not have anticipated, including school closings, 
economic anxiety and concern over vulnerable family 
members and friends.As we all navigated ongoing challenges, continuing to 
support our employees’ well-being and enabling them 
to continue working safely remained top priorities. 
We adopted flexible policies that empowered people 
to work remotely and address child care and school-at-
home needs. To help employees avoid financial difficulty, 
we provided continuing pay for those affected directly 
by COVID-19. For example, if an employee was not able 
to work remotely and considered high risk based on 
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
guidelines, the employee still received a paycheck. 
While the year proved to be difficult in many ways, our 
people remained focused on our core values, delivering 
results and caring for their families and one another.

South Gate, California
Wendy B. Johnson, Transport 
Manager for MPLX’s Transport and 
Rail Fleet Operations, started her 
career in the trucking industry in 1996. 
From an early age, she had always loved trucks 
and knew she would one day find herself behind 
the big wheel. Today, she supervises a team of 55 
at the Vinvale terminal. The trucking industry is a 
predominantly male field. The U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reported in 2020 less than 8% of truck 
drivers were women. “It amazes me that there 
are not more women in the industry because it is 
a great way to make a living, ” Wendy said. “When 
most people hear of truck driving, they think of 
long hours over the road, but as transport drivers 
at MPC, we safely deliver to regional customers, 
so our schedules are flexible, allowing us to spend 
time with our families. ” Angelica Arenas  
South Gate, California
Angelica is a driver trainer at MPC 
and has been in the field for more 
than 20 years. “Ever since I was 
a little girl, I was fascinated by trucks, ” 
Angelica said. “By my late teen years, I wanted 
to get into the field, but my mother said no 
because she thought it was a job for men only. 
Later in life, I decided to go for it, and I’m very 
happy I did. I love truck driving and training others 
in the company. I always tell people, don’t be 
afraid to ask questions. It’s the only way you 
learn. For women who aspire to drive trucks, I’d 
say if your heart’s in it – then you can do it. I also 
tell them that the benefits are great, and as a 
mom to five children, transport driving really does 
offer a good work-life balance. ” SIX WOMEN TRANSPORT DRIVERS ARE ON 
THE MOVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
Hear How They Got Started in the Industry and Why they Enjoy Working for MPC
Danielle Pearl  
Long Beach, California  
Danielle has been a fuel truck driver 
for more than seven years. “I had 
always wanted to drive something 
big, but never thought it would be a fuel 
truck, ” Danielle said. “ As a woman driver, I’ve had 
to prove myself to those who said I couldn’t be 
successful in this field. I'm very determined to go 
above and beyond to get the job done and enjoy 
meeting people each day. Driving is not just for 
men, and more women should get involved. My 
male peers seem to have found a new respect for 
women drivers. ” Amber Bensema  
Bloomington, California
Amber has been driving trucks for 
more than five years. “I started out 
driving buses and loved it, ” she said. 
“From there, I wanted to try something 
different and got involved with trucking. Not only 
are the benefits excellent, but the culture at MPC 
is the best. For anyone who wants to join the 
industry, I tell them it’s a process. Sometimes, 
you have to try different areas of truck driving to 
get where you want to be. There’s a lot of career 
opportunities in trucking. I see people move up the 
chain in this industry all the time, so there’s room 
for career growth. ” Rhoda Pratt  
South Gate, California
Inspired by her late father who was 
also a truck driver, Rhoda has been 
a transport driver for more than 17 
years. When asked by other women how 
they can get involved with trucking, Rhoda tells 
them, “It’s important to find a good school that is 
going to properly train you and that you can do it if 
you put your mind to it. ” Rhoda tells people not to 
be intimated by the truck’s size. “I drive my truck 
better than my car, ” she said. “You sit very high 
up in a truck, so you’re able to see everything. 
You’ll go through some challenging periods, but 
in the end, it’s all worth it. I love my job and enjoy 
meeting new people at every station I visit. ” 
T ammy Boliou  
Long Beach, California
Tammy has driven fuel tanker trucks 
throughout her entire 36-year career, 
safely driving over 1 .7 million miles 
and spending 21 of those years as a driver 
trainer. “Growing up I always had an affinity for 
trucks, and as a girl dreamed of myself behind 
the wheel, ” she said. “By 1985 I was blessed 
with the opportunity to start driving for a major oil 
company. Having been inspired by two pioneering 
women of our industry, I was fully aware that 
women were few. Knowing this I worked hard 
to establish myself as a competent and efficient 
driver. I hope to see more women consider 
a transport career and enjoy positive working 
conditions, great benefits and the security offered 
by MPC and the industry. Overall the years have 
taught me to accept change, rise to the challenge 
and look forward to a good retirement!” 
2020 Sustainability Report | 37EMBED SUSTAINABILITYKey Benefits Compensation and Benefits 
Compensation and benefits are some of the most direct 
ways to acknowledge and encourage quality performance and 
meaningful contributions from our employees. To ensure we 
are offering competitive pay packages, we annually benchmark 
compensation, including base salaries and incentive targets. 
All employees participate in our annual incentive programs, 
which represent a critical component of our compensation. 
These programs provide rewards for MPC’s achievements 
against preset financial and operational goals, encouraging 
performance and a sense of employee ownership. 
Workforce Impacts of the Pandemic 
Amid continued declines in fuel consumption due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the indefinite idling of our refineries 
in Martinez, California and Gallup, New Mexico, MPC was 
faced with the need to reduce its workforce by approximately 
12% (excluding Speedway employees) in the fall of 2020. For 
those employees whose jobs were impacted by the staffing 
reduction, we provided severance pay and the extension of 
certain benefits. 
Severance payments included not only an allowance linked 
to their rate of pay and tenure with the company, but also 
a prorated payment equivalent to the employees' target 
bonuses for the year. 
Impacted employees who were enrolled in MPC’s medical, 
dental and/or vision plans had the option to continue their 
coverage for up to six months at active employee rates, 
followed by 18 months at COBRA rates. Our Employee 
Assistance Plan (EAP) was available to impacted employees 
at no cost for three years. The EAP includes services such as 
professional counseling for a variety of issues, referrals for 
child/elder care and access to a host of educational resources. 
We also provided out-placement assistance, including job 
search and resume writing provided by a third party, or up to

The safety of our employees, contractors, 
business partners, customers and the community 
is our number-one priority. Consistent with our 
core values, we approach our work with the highest 
commitment to safety and a focus on care for the 
environment. To continually reinforce these values 
and drive strong performance, we use a combination 
of best practice-based operational standards, 
documented work processes, proven management 
systems and behavior-based programs designed 
to train, protect and empower our employees and 
contractors. 
Personal Safety 
It is critical that everyone at MPC and MPLX is 
empowered to create and maintain a safe and healthy 
workplace. Employees and contractors are held to 
the same high standards and expectations, and are 
authorized to stop any work if they feel at risk. Part 
of our effort to promote safety includes our OEMS, 
a management system based on the principles of 
RC14001® and the Plan-Do-Check-Act continual 
improvement cycle. Together, these components 
provide us with a comprehensive approach to 
managing risks and preventing incidents, illnesses 
and fatalities. The personal safety standards that we 
implement comply with and in many cases exceed 
local, state and federal regulations. Employees and 
contractors are trained on these standards, and 
audits and quality assurance visits are frequently 
conducted to assess effectiveness. Strict adherence 
to processes and procedures that help avoid safety 
and environmental incidents is integral to our safety 
culture.33

2020 Sustainability Report |  43EMBED SUSTAINABILITYPromoting the Health and Safety of Our Workforce During a Global Pandemic
MPC activated its CERT to consistently and 
aggressively respond to needs across our company. In 
coordination with MPC’s Heath Services Department, 
and in alignment with recommendations from the 
CDC, CERT implemented MPC’s wide-ranging 
pandemic response plan. This included distributing to 
employees and contractors the personal protective 
equipment (PPE) from our central inventory when the 
pandemic began — respirators, surgical masks and Some of the actions taken by MPC specifically 
aimed at protecting and addressing the needs of our 
employees and contractors include:
 Enhancing our cleaning and disinfection 
measures at all of our locations, focusing on high 
touch points, common areas, and workstations.
 Providing appropriate PPE.
 Implementing social-distancing procedures for 
our essential employees (federally designated 
Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers) and work-
from-home requirements, where practicable.
 Requiring daily COVID-19 self-screening per 
the CDC screening checklist before entering the 
workplace.
 Providing educational resources including videos, 
emails and signage around facilities.
 Providing critical up-to-date information and 
guidance through a dedicated COVID-19 
employee website.
 Converting a hotline used for work-related injuries 
into a dedicated 24/7 nurse hotline — fielding 
over 12,000 calls.
 Managing a COVID-19 email address − MPC 
medical professionals responded to over 15,000 
emails from employees.
 Providing oversight to local COVID-19 initiatives 
and case management with Health Services 
teams positioned at each of our refineries.
 Establishing a strong communication network  
with key contractors so information could 
be shared, and providing an avenue for the 
contractors to report positive cases to MPC.
 Establishing a phased-in approach for return to 
offices based on state and local requirements and 
restrictions, as well as a sustained local reduction 
in COVID-19 case positivity rates.
 Facilitating a robust campaign educating 
employees on the vaccines, directly administering 
or scheduling over 2,400 people across the 
company through local public health or closed 
points of distribution.
From the start of the global COVID-19 
pandemic, our people came together 
to ensure that the health and safety 
of our employees and contractors, 
including essential personnel, 
remained our top priority.
nitrile gloves — as well as acquiring and distributing 
additional PPE and sanitation materials. CERT worked 
with the Information Technology (IT) department to 
increase capabilities for noncritical employees to work 
remotely, developed safe work and travel policies, 
and implemented a number of protective measures 
to ensure the health of employees and contractors 
as essential personnel continued to keep our critical 
operations running safely. 
44EMBED SUSTAINABILITYFrom our operations leadership to our frontline 
workers, everyone is expected to hold themselves 
and others accountable to our safety standards. 
This is communicated through a robust onboarding 
process for both employees and contractors, and 
reinforced through recurrent trainings and safety 
discussions. We ensure that employees and 
contractors alike know that if they feel a task is being 
performed unsafely, they each have the authority to 
stop the work in progress until the safety concern is 
addressed, no matter how big or small the job may 
be. Our field leadership team members emphasize 
our focus on safety by personally conducting regular 
safety meetings with employees to ensure two-way 
communication and continuous learning. Contractor Safety 
Our strong commitment to safety is reflected in 
the rigorous process undertaken to select service 
providers. As part of a comprehensive evaluation 
process, potential partners must: 
 Prove an exemplary record of safety. 
 Demonstrate a strong health and safety culture for 
their employees and concern for our community. 
 Practice sound environmental stewardship. 
 Utilize innovative technology and tools to improve 
safety and performance. 
 Meet all federal and state regulations. 
 Receive training for their specific roles. 
830,000+
hours of health and safety  
training for MPC employeesSafety From the Top Down and Bottom Up
To support this disciplined selection process, 
prospective contractors’ health and safety programs 
and safety data, including total recordable incident 
rates and federal OSHA logs, are vetted by an 
independent third party before we will sign contracts 
with them. 
After a job is awarded, and prior to starting work at 
any of our facilities, all contractors and subcontractors 
conducting what MPC and MPLX define as 
“safety sensitive” work must complete a series of 
requirements. A pre-job safety questionnaire must be 
filled out, and daily safe work permits are completed 
by an MPC employee with input from the contractor.
Promoting a collaborative approach to safety, 12 of our 
nested contractors have become VPP certified at our 
sites with us serving as sponsors. 
2020 Sustainability Report |  45EMBED SUSTAINABILITYDriving Improved Safety Performance 
Behavior-Based Safety Programs 
Our behavior-based safety (BBS) programs 
empower employees and contractors to enhance 
safety practices in the workplace through peer 
observations. These programs manage employee 
exposure at the working interface: the point at 
which employee activities interact with workplace 
conditions and management systems. Safety 
excellence is directly related to how effective our 
organization is at controlling exposure to hazards, 
and we have found that BBS programs drive strong 
safety performance. 
BBS Programs: 
 Help identify the reasons for operational  
choices made. 
 Reinforce safe behaviors.
 Identify safer ways to perform tasks. 
 Start conversations that lead to safer  
decisions before injury can occur. 
Incident Reporting and Tracking 
All employees and contractors have the right 
to report an incident or injury without reprisal. 
We utilize a company-wide software system to 
actively report, track and identify trends in incidents 
and injuries. The system enables tracking and 
documentation of incident investigations and 
corrective actions, with management oversight 
until an incident is closed, if needed. TRANSPORTATION  
SAFETY 
Throughout the pandemic MPC’s transport 
drivers have continued to safely deliver 
essential transportation fuels to gas stations 
and other locations around the country. In 
2020, our transport drivers drove more than 
57 million miles with an at-fault accident rate 
of 0.3 per million miles.

Keeping our Operations Safe 
By applying good practice in the design and 
implementation of the equipment and systems we 
use and keeping safety risks and their mitigation at 
the forefront, we strive to continually improve the 
safety of our operations. Through our OEMS and 
adherence to Process Safety Management (PSM), 
we work to reduce the number and severity of 
process safety events. This is achieved by maintaining 
equipment integrity, managing change, and enforcing 
safe work practices and operating procedures. 
MPC and MPLX maintain standards for PSM that 
emphasize managing hazards by using technologies, 
procedures and management practices. We also 
maintain a rigorous auditing schedule to ensure 
facilities are assessed across all 141 process safety 
elements, which are listed below.

On our journey of continual improvement, we have and 
continue to implement tools and programs, such as 
Learning Teams and the American Fuel & Petrochemical 
Manufacturers (AFPM) Walk the Line program. 
 Learning Teams are sessions in which the team and 
facilitator discuss a specific task or an unplanned event 
to better understand the context of how the work is 
done.
 AFPM's Walk the Line program reinforces the 
fundamental responsibility of employees to know with 
100% certainty where a material will flow between 
any two points in a process unit. If they do not, they 
need to “walk the line. ” Walk the Line upholds a culture 
of consistency in which we can reduce errors while 
supporting operators and frontline supervisors in 
operational discipline and readiness.
2020 SAFETY AUDIT 
HIGHLIGHT: SMART 
HELMETS 
In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
widespread travel restrictions and our 
focus on maintaining the health and 
safety of our employees, we conducted 
some safety audits virtually by utilizing a 
“smart” helmet. 
A smart helmet is a remote collaboration 
wearable device equipped with a camera 
and audio capabilities, allowing auditors 
to communicate with and see what the 
field representative sees. 
Just as we would do for in-person audits, 
when issues were identified, they were 
documented in our incident tracking tool 
and the findings were tracked to closure.

Stakeholder Engagement Plans aid in 
identifying key stakeholders and issues, 
along with strategies to build and maintain 
relationships and open dialogue, surface 
concerns and develop solutions, and forge 
partnerships, where appropriate. We believe 
it is important to coordinate across the

engagement with local community leaders 
and residents. When COVID-19 brought 
about some challenges with traditional face-
to-face engagement, CAPs turned to virtual 
options to continue meeting during 2020.
CAPs meet on a regular basis and consist of 
representatives from the community, which 
may include teachers, retirees, business 
owners, elected officials, residents who live 
near our facilities, community organizers 
and other interested parties. CAPs provide 
a forum for:
 Listening and gaining insight into 
activities, issues, concerns and

Building Relationships and Earning Trust
Earning trust is at the heart of MPL ’s mission. In 2020, 
MPL enhanced its public engagement program, Earning 
Your Trust, by implementing a data-driven strategy to 
reduce third-party damage and near-miss incidents as 
MPL continues to “drive to zero” spills. Using data 
analytics, MPL focused on specific locations to provide 
relevant informational and educational messages for 
landowners. 
Staying Engaged  
Throughout 2020, MPL reached out to partner 
schools, nursing homes and hospitals near MPL-
operated pipelines to promote consistent engagement 
throughout the pandemic and understand their needs 
and where MPL could help. MPL also engaged the 
public by sending emails and holding focused social 
media campaigns. Virtual Emergency Preparedness 
meetings were held with 26 schools in proximity to 
MPL pipelines to promote pipeline safety. Listening to Landowners
MPL leverages data to focus outreach efforts where 
they are needed most. In the first three months of 
2020, MPL held seven events that reached more 
than 400 landowners in locations where pipelines are 
located in agricultural areas. When in-person events 
were canceled early in the year, MPL adapted its 
engagement approach to include communications via 
phone, email and social media. MPL also completed a 
five-year landowner mail campaign along the pipeline 
to build relationships, earn trust and increase pipeline 
safety knowledge. Survey results showed that the 
mail campaign was effective — 98% of landowners 
were aware of MPL-operated pipelines located on 
their property, compared to 69% in 2016. Through its industry-leading public engagement program, MPLX’s wholly owned subsidiary, 
Marathon Pipe Line LLC (MPL), engages and educates landowners, community members, 
schools and public officials on pipeline safety and infrastructure. 
LEVERAGING 
TECHNOLOGY
In 2020, the Marathon Pipeline Finder app 
for smartphones underwent significant 
design and functionality upgrades to serve 
as a valuable safety resource to stakeholders 
near MPL -operated pipelines. The app allows 
users to: 
 Easily locate MPL -operated pipelines. 
 Learn what products are transported. 
 Call 811 and review steps for safe digging.

SPOKANE COUNTY, 
WASHINGTONA contribution to the Spokane County Fire District 10 helped the 
district purchase medical equipment, a LUCAS Chest Compression 
device, for one of their rescue trucks. Just four days after receiving it, 
the device was used on a patient for 45 minutes of continuous auto

2020 Sustainability Report |  53EMBED SUSTAINABILITYEmployee Giving and Volunteer Program
Part of being a valued member of the community is being there when people need you the most. One way 
we enable support to our communities is through MPC Gives, an employee-directed, open giving program that 
encourages employees to support the organizations and community efforts that are important to them. We 
support their efforts by matching employee donations and funding volunteer incentive awards, and in 2020 we 
increased our company match to employee donations from 60% to 100%. 
Our employees responded by finding creative ways to contribute and strengthen our communities. They helped 
make people's lives a little better during one of the most challenging periods of most of our lives. 
Throughout 2020, our 
employees gave of their 
time and money to support 
local communities during 
the pandemic.FIGHTING YOUTH

Stark County Hunger T ask Force  
Stark County, Ohio
Like people throughout the country, 
residents of Stark County, Ohio, keenly felt 
the impact of the pandemic. In a typical 
month, the Stark County Hunger Task Force 
(SCHTF) provides about 33,000 meals 
to members of the community. With the 
number of people served reaching new 
records in 2020, the organization needed to 
find a way to keep its pantry stocked. 
Support came in the form of donations from 
employees at our Canton, Ohio, refinery, 
who raised more than $36,000 — which 
grew to $73,000 after MPC matched the 
funds. The funds supported the SCHTF 
backpack program, which provides non-
perishable food items for students on 
weekends, when the school-provided meals 
are not available. The backpacks include 
servings for two breakfasts, two lunches 
and two dinners, and are designed so the 
students, usually third to fifth graders, can 
prepare these meals on their own.
What made this campaign a success was 
the imagination and motivation of our 
employees who initiated and led the effort. 
Our Canton employees showed how they 
truly care about helping others in our 
community.
54EMBED SUSTAINABILITYPolitical Contributions and Advocacy
We believe participating in the political process is an 
essential part of advancing the meaningful exchange 
of information and views on issues that affect our 
company and our stakeholders.
MPC takes part in the political process in several 
ways, including lobbying, contributing to grassroots 
activity, advocacy for specific issues, participating in 
trade associations, supporting an active employee 
political action committee, and, where lawful, directly 
supporting political candidates and ballot issues.
All these activities are subject to oversight by our 
Board of Directors, general counsel and senior 
vice president of Government Affairs, and senior 
management. For comprehensive reporting on these activities, 
please visit our website.
Climate Policy
As it relates to climate change, our public policy 
engagement is guided by our commitment to 
sustainability, including lowering the carbon intensity 
of our operations and products, expanding renewable 
fuels and technologies, conserving natural resources, 
engaging stakeholders and contributing in our 
communities. We support policies that complement 
this strategy and the investments that continue to 
transform our company. Trade Associations 
Taking part in trade associations is an important part 
of our role as an active member of our industry and 
the business communities in which we operate.
Trade associations provide important ways for us to 
engage in the development of industry standards 
and practices, and to share advances in science and 
engineering that inform the best practices of the 
future. 
When our trade associations engage on climate 
policy, we encourage them to take positions that are 
consistent with our commitment to sustainability. 
Because we do not control the position of any trade 
association, many times they don’t endorse our 
preferred positions. Our company may take positions 
that are different from — or extend beyond the scope 
of — trade association platforms.
We are encouraged by several of our major trade 
associations’ recent positions on climate change, 
and we believe our industry has an opportunity to 
coalesce around the development and delivery of 
solutions. 
Each year, our senior management reviews trade 
association memberships and assesses the 
effectiveness of the respective groups and the utility 
of MPC’s new or continued participation.

2020 Sustainability Report |  55EMBED SUSTAINABILITYAdvancing Supply Chain Sustainability
We prioritize integrating ESG within supply chain 
strategy and extend our commitment to sustainability 
across the value chain. 
Selecting Trusted Partners
MPC and MPLX have relationships with thousands
of suppliers that enable us to operate in a safe and
efficient manner. We depend on these suppliers
to provide goods and services, such as materials,
equipment, construction, labor, transportation, office
products and services, benefits administration, and
accounting, legal and engineering services. We value 
our relationships with suppliers and rely on them not 
only to provide essential goods and services, but also 
to align with our core values and drive for superior 
results. 
MPC and MPLX strive to partner with suppliers 
that maintain high safety and ethical standards; 
demonstrate a commitment to sustainability; offer 
innovative, value-added capabilities; understand our 
business; embrace quality procedures and processes; 
and offer superior technology, cost or service 
advantages. 
We manage risk, in part, through the selection of 
suppliers. A robust procurement process evaluates 
potential suppliers against key safety metrics and 
programs. Between the use of predominantly 
U.S. domestic suppliers bound by U.S. laws and 
regulations and focused vetting of international 
suppliers, our strategic procurement decisions 
reduce supply chain risks related to personnel safety, 
environmental issues and human rights. 
No significant changes to our Tier 1 supply chain 
occurred in 2020 that would cause or contribute to 
significant economic, environmental or social impacts. Supplier Code of Conduct 
In 2020, we implemented a standalone, tailored 
Supplier Code of Conduct. As a precondition to 
participating in our standard bidding process, potential 
suppliers must first acknowledge and accept the 
Supplier Code of Conduct. 
The Supplier Code of Conduct emphasizes 
expectations of suppliers in the areas of: 
 Environmental, health, safety and security 
 Legal and ethical compliance 
 Conflict minerals 
 Conflicts of interest 
 Human rights 
 Diversity 
 Compliance assurance 
 Reporting unethical or illegal acts

Business Conduct.2020 Non-U.S. Spend by Country1

In 2020, we partnered with EcoVadis, a worldwide

and performance improvement tools for global 
supply chains, to initiate supplier ESG performance 
assessments and evaluate compliance with the 
Supplier Code of Conduct. Utilizing a risk-based 
approach, this will initially focus on Tier 1 Critical 
Suppliers. 
Additionally, we make available a toll-free Integrity 
Helpline and encourage all suppliers to anonymously 
report suspected unethical or illegal acts. 
All supply chain employees received Supplier Code 
of Conduct training in 2020. They also receive annual 
training on sustainable procurement topics, including 
compliance and ethics, human rights, diversity and 
environmental issues. This empowers employees 
to be educated, aware and proactive to minimize

diversity with the goal of increasing the number of 
small and diverse supply chain partners. We aim to 
do this by providing potentially underrepresented 
companies an equal opportunity to become a trusted 
business partner and encouraging participation in our 
Supplier Diversity Program. 
THE BENEFITS OF 
DIVERSITY 
Partnering with small and diverse businesses, 
including local suppliers, attracts qualified 
providers of goods and services, stimulates 
local economic development, drives 
innovation and creates lasting social benefits 
in the communities where we live and work.Each year, we select a class of small or diverse 
companies that are not currently MPC or MPLX 
suppliers to participate in a seven-month Leadership, 
Engagement and Development (LEAD) mentorship 
program. We use this program to help each participant 
strengthen their general business and industry 
knowledge, as well as to provide networking and 
business opportunities. 
In 2021, we look forward to expanding and 
redeveloping this offering into a web-based program 
that will allow for additional participants and integrate 
the participation of MPC and MPLX subject matter 
experts. Using follow-up surveys and input from 
suppliers, we plan to continuously adjust program 
content to provide the most value for participants.
Supplier Recognition Awards
Our annual Supplier Recognition Awards program is 
designed to recognize refining and MPLX suppliers 
for outstanding performance in alignment with our

Our Board of Directors
Our Board oversees the management of our business and affairs. The Board 
believes that MPC’s commitment to strong corporate governance benefits all 
our stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees, business partners, 
customers, communities, the government and others who have a stake in how 
we operate. In its primary oversight role, our Board guides our strategic direction, 
including ESG and sustainability objectives. 
Our directors represent a diverse range of critical skills, experience and 
perspectives — including significant industry experience, leadership and board 
experience, and expertise in the areas of ESG and sustainability, energy, finance, 
operations, risk management and public policy — that contributes to sound 
governance and effective oversight of our operations, risks and long-term strategy.
Our Corporate Governance Principles affirm our Board's long-standing 
commitment to actively seeking diverse Board candidates with a focus on women 
and candidates of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds. 
In April 2020, our Board elected John P . Surma as independent chairman. In April

Governance
At MPC, our impacts, risks and 
opportunities related to ESG topics are 
identified and managed by company 
leadership with the oversight of our Board. 
The Board has four committees, each of 
which is responsible for specific areas 
of oversight and policy decision-making, 
as set forth in our Corporate Governance 
Principles and each committee’s charter.
Our executive leadership team has primary 
responsibility for sustainability strategies 
and standards. Sustainability is embedded 
in several cross-functional leadership 
committees that help ensure our objectives 
are incorporated into our OEMS standards 
and sustainability strategies. These are in 
turn cascaded throughout the organization. 
These standards and strategies are 
developed by committees of the executive 
leadership team and aligned with related 
procedures and plans at the operational 
level. 
Communication and collaboration 
among the Board, its committees and 
management are critical to maintaining our 
aligned direction on sustainability matters.
Good governance is our way of 
ensuring MPC adheres to our

We believe that everyone — including our employees, 
contractors and business partners — shares 
responsibility for our sustainability performance. 
We conduct business in a safe, responsible, and cost-
effective manner, as set forth in our policies, standards 
and procedures and managed through our OEMS.
A Foundation of Best Practices
We began formalizing our OEMS over 15 years 
ago with adherence to the Responsible Care® 
Management System (RCMS). In 2018, we combined 
our RCMS into a more comprehensive RC14001® 
management system. RC14001® is built on the globally 
recognized ISO 14001 environmental management 
system, and includes health, safety and security 
requirements. 
In 2020, we published our new integrated OEMS, 
which expands on the RC14001® scope and aligns 
with ISO 9001, incorporating quality and an increased 
stakeholder and process focus. 
OEMS supports our ability to manage risks and 
internal and external requirements, engage with our 
stakeholders and further deliver on our sustainability 
objectives. 
A Systematic Approach
OEMS provides a systematic approach to advancing 
performance by outlining requirements that will 
enable us to achieve our goals and ensure our 
long-term success. 
We complement our OEMS with performance-
based standards that set organizational 
expectations. We periodically review and update 
these standards to reflect changes in laws 
or regulations, incorporate recommendations 
arising from audits and incident investigations, 
incorporate stakeholder feedback and continually 
improve performance.
MPC’s HES&S Management Committee, made up 
of Executive Leadership Team members, oversees 
implementation of our OEMS. 
Click here to learn more about our OEMS.
Beginning in 2020, 100% of 
our company is in scope of our 
OEMS, which has been third-
party reviewed for alignment 
with RC14001® and ISO 9001.OEMS IN ACTION
OEMS helps us right-size the rigor we build around 
our processes and programs to ensure we put the 
right resources and controls in place.
 “ I identified a gap in the process with how we 
were reviewing the data coming in from the 
field. I made a change to review data daily 
to help improve data quality and address 
immediate issues. This review helped prevent a

 “ Even with excellent standards and caring, 
dedicated employees, there are opportunities 
for errors. OEMS provides a documented 
and structured platform to bring all of those 
resources together for continual improvement. ”

ERM Committee 
Directs ERM process for identifying, assessing and managing enterprise risk 
Monitors the performance of risk mitigation strategiesRoles and ResponsibilitiesEnterprise Risk Management Program  
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is how we 
identify, assess and manage enterprise-level risks and 
review the effectiveness of risk-mitigation strategies. 
Enterprise-level risks include environmental, social 
and governance risks such as climate and compliance-
related risks, as well as other risks described in our 
Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
ERM Process 
Our ERM process is continuous and dynamic to 
help us identify emerging risks that may impact our 
ability to operate and efficiently allocate resources. 
The process involves a cross-functional review of 
potential enterprise-level risks, including sustainability 
risks. Our enterprise risk manager leads the process 
through quarterly leadership workshops that involve 
key leaders with responsibility for our sustainability 
priorities. Our risk analysis includes an examination of the causes and consequences of each enterprise-
level risk, as well as the development of strategies 
to mitigate risks — imminent and potential — 
and position the company to capitalize on new 
opportunities. 
ERM Community 
We have formed an ERM community to support the 
ERM Committee. It comprises mid-level risk and 
assurance representatives across our value chain and 
meets quarterly to discuss, develop, standardize and 
integrate risk management best practices throughout 
the company to support risk-based decision-making. 
The Board and Executive Leadership Team routinely 
review and discuss enterprise-level risks and 
strategies, and the Board’s Audit Committee further 
reviews our ERM process and performance trends  
and oversees internal controls and audits to evaluate 
their effectiveness. Climate-Related Risk 
We carefully review, evaluate and manage climate-
related risks and opportunities to ensure our ability 
to adapt and strengthen our resiliency. These include 
both transitional and physical risks, which we routinely 
discuss with the Board’s Sustainability and Public 
Policy Committee and executive and senior leadership 
committees. 
For more information on how we manage climate-
related risks and opportunities and the role cross-
functional committees play, please see Page 34 of 
our 2021 Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios 
Report. 
Compliance-Related Risk 
As part of our ERM process, our Board oversees 
risks related to the regulatory landscape, including 
emerging and proposed regulations related to issues 
that have the potential to impact our business, such as 
GHG and other air emissions, water withdrawals and 
effluents, hazardous materials management, product 
specifications, and employee health and safety. 
Identification and Disclosure of Risks 
We disclose material risks to our company in the Risk 
Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and 
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q that are filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. Categories of

It's our expectation that our employees are 
knowledgeable about applicable legal requirements 
and act accordingly. 
Our approach to ethics goes beyond compliance 
with evolving laws and regulations to include 
implementation of proactive initiatives to safeguard 
our business reputation, the environment and the 
communities where we live and work. Selecting 
contractors, suppliers and other business partners that 
demonstrate similar commitments is also critical. Code of Business Conduct 
Operating with the highest standards of integrity is 
part of our culture. These standards are woven into 
our day-to-day work and through our Code of Business 
Conduct, which is based on the overarching principle 
that we always strive to do the right thing. 
Our Code lays the foundation for sound business 
decisions. It defines expectations for ethical decision-
making, accountability and responsibility for every 
employee at all levels of MPC, including those 
providing services to MPLX. It also requires that 
employees immediately report any suspected illegal 
or unethical conduct connected with the business of 
MPC or its affiliates. 
Approved by the Board, the Code of Business 
Conduct speaks to matters such as:

to complete an annual Code of Business Conduct 
certification that enables employees to disclose issues

24/7 Anonymous Integrity Helpline 
The Integrity Helpline enables employees, contractors, 
vendors, customers, community members and 
others to ask questions or raise allegations related to 
workplace behavior or ethics. While all our employees 
are encouraged to speak with their immediate 
supervisors if they have questions or concerns related 
to ethics and the Code, the helpline is an additional 
avenue to do so anonymously. 
Every allegation received through the helpline is 
investigated in a manner and to the extent appropriate, 
based on the nature of the allegation. The goal is to 
resolve all matters within 90 days. 
Where warranted, investigations may result in 
discipline, a change in policy or procedure or a 
determination that an allegation of unlawful and/or 
unethical behavior could not be substantiated. We maintain a firm no-retaliation policy and will never 
permit a good-faith submission to be a cause for 
disciplinary action. Helpline statistics are reported 
to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, 
with certain types of allegations escalated rapidly. 
These include certain allegations regarding financial 
statements and reporting and allegations of Code 
violations by directors or officers.

and standards to protect our computer 
systems, data, assets, infrastructure 
and computing environments from 
cybersecurity threats — and to safeguard 
confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
MPC’s Chief Information Security Officer 
is responsible for our cybersecurity 
program and provides periodic briefings 
to the Audit Committee and the Board.
Our Best Defense:  
Vigilant Employees 
Our employees and contractors receive 
training to equip them in managing 
cybersecurity risks. Informed employees 
and contractors use common sense and 
situational cybersecurity awareness to 
do the same things that physical and 
digital firewalls do — keep good things 
in and bad things out. Both employees 
and contractors act as bidirectional 
control agents for what comes into and 
goes out of both company networks and 
personal home networks. Security on 
these personal networks is even more 
important given current expanded work-
from-home arrangements.
A simulated phishing program is used to 
train and test MPC email account users 
on how to act as a “human firewall. ” 
Users are shown how to identify and 
report phishing emails, and periodically 
simulated phishing emails are sent to test 
users’ awareness of phishing attacks. Our 
phishing program provides immediate 
feedback to users and notifies the 
individual’s management in the event of 
repeated failures.

64EMBED SUSTAINABILITYOur cybersecurity program 
is aligned with NIST 
Cybersecurity Framework 
and relevant NIST 
publications, such as NIST 
SP 800-53, NIST SP 800-82.Cybersecurity Policies 
Our Computer Security Policy governs our
cybersecurity efforts and compliance with all legal 
requirements. The policy is implemented through 
a governance process that includes standards, 
procedures, risk management, defense strategy and 
compliance reviews.
Cybersecurity policies apply to MPC and MPLX 
entities, employees and third parties that own, 
manage, administer, support, develop or work on 
company information systems, and to all our computing 
environments, whether connected to or segregated 
from our corporate network, including business 
partners and suppliers. We emphasize policy awareness 
for employees through training and supervisor 
engagement, and implement policy compliance through 
a structured escalation program, if needed.
Our Code of Business Conduct further addresses 
protection of company assets, information systems, 
social media, business records retention and 
confidential information.
Managing Technology Risks 
We manage technology risks through a resilient system 
of layered security architecture. Security limits are 
placed on physical access, we segment business and 
operational networks, and align critical applications to 
withstand cyberattacks by using data centers protected 
by additional layers of security.
Internal IT controls allow us to detect centralized 
security events by allowing seamless bidirectional data 
flow between each system and the enterprise security 
control center.
Our cybersecurity program aligns with the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) – 
Cybersecurity Framework, a control framework that 
helps companies develop a standardized model 
on which to build their information technology and 
operational technology cybersecurity program and 
subsequently measure their maturity in this important 
area.THE IMPORTANCE OF  
BEING PREPARED  
 We test our cybersecurity response 
procedures and business continuity plans 
annually.
 To help ensure preparedness, we 
conduct risk assessments, vulnerability 
analyses and targeted penetration testing 
throughout the year.
 We use independent third parties to 
audit, assess and test aspects of our 
cybersecurity program.
Addressing Third-Party Risks 
Utilizing both internal and third-party vendor-
provided capabilities, we maintain a proactive, 
data-centric cybersecurity risk assessment and 
management program. As part of the approach, 
employees are trained to report and escalate 
suspicious incidents and cyberthreats to our IT 
Service Desk. We continue to expand our due 
diligence capabilities in response to a changing 
cloud landscape.
Threat awareness and prevention training begins 
when an employee is hired and continues 
throughout each employee’s tenure, delivering 
training and materials through multiple channels. 
Contractors also participate in these initiatives.
Privacy is Vital 
Protecting any and all personal data we receive is
a top priority. We comply with applicable privacy 
laws, as well as applicable privacy regulations 
and safeguards, which have been applied to our 
operations across the country.
MPC adheres to the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard, which provides a baseline of 
technical and operational requirements to protect 
customers’ payment card account data, and we 
engage a third-party Qualified Security Assessor to 
assess our compliance annually.

Notes
(1)  As reported in the MPC 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2020 data.  As a result of the agreement to sell Speedway, its results are reported separately as discontinued operations.  Previous years’ data is as reported in the MPC 2019 Annual Report 
on Form 10-K.           
(2) Based on the American Petroleum Institute's definition of environmental expenditures.           
(3) These amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation.
(4)  Data before 2019 inclusive of facilities that MPC did not yet own so that performance can be compared across the same asset base over time. Assets included are those which MPC owned/operated as of Dec. 31, 2019, unless otherwise noted. 
Estimates used in some instances where historic data was unavailable.           
(5)  No significant difference between total addressable market and market Marathon serves.  
Non-revenue generating initiatives to commercialize biofuels.  
MPC has participated in numerous precompetitive research projects around biofuels, including:     
 —Coordinating Research Council - nonprofit organization that directs engineering and  environmental studies on the interaction between automotive/other mobility equipment and petroleum products.
 —U.S. DRIVE Fuels Working Group - researching higher levels of biofuels into gasolines. U.S. DRIVE is a voluntary government-industry partnership focused on advanced automotive and related energy infrastructure technology research and 
development.         
Virent collaborates with many key industry and government partners around advanced biofuels:           
 —Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK) – working with key partners such as the Federal Aviation Administration, University of Dayton Research Institute, Air Force Research Lab, GE Aviation, ASTM, and others on the production and certification of SAK for 
use as a sustainable aviation fuel.
 —Renewable Gasoline – working with key partners such as Southwest Research Institute, Johnson Matthey and Cargill on the production and distribution of renewable gasoline.
 —Distillate Fuels from Biomass – working with the University of Colorado-Boulder in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Royal Dutch Shell on the production of distillate fuels from woody biomass.
 —Conversion Process for Lignocellulosic Feedstocks: Virent’s BioForming technology’s current focus is on using sugars from commercial crops to enable faster commercialization of advanced biofuels such as renewable gasoline, SAK and diesel 
blendstocks, and to provide a pathway for commercializing conversion processes for lignocellulosic feedstocks and cellulosic sugars. Current and prior development activities include work with a number of industry and government partners 
developing cellulosic sugar technologies, as well as the development of Virent’s proprietary lignocellulosic conversion technology under competitive grant awards from the US DOE, USDA, DOT and Commerce and in collaboration with various National 
Laboratories, universities, and Wright Patterson Air Force Base.     
(6) Environmental performance reported for facilities of which MPC has operational control.           
(7)  Scope 1 direct GHG emissions include those from Refining, MPLX and Retail/other and are typically calculated per the EPA ’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program or the 2009 API Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for 
the Oil and Natural Gas Industry. Global Warming Potentials used are from Table A-1 to Subpart A of 40 CFR Part 98 as of February 2020.       
(8) Inclusive of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6). Hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), and perfluorocarbons (PFC) emissions are considered to not be material to our operations and are therefore excluded. 
(9) The Martinez and Los Angeles refineries are currently subject to the California Cap-and-Trade Program.
(10) MPLX emissions data includes emissions from all midstream facilities and, as such, a small amount of MPLX reported emissions are from MPC-owned midstream facilities.
(11) Location-based Scope 2 emissions that include indirect GHG emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam.
(12) See page 7 and 8 of MPC's and MPLX's June 2021 Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios report for an explanation of Scope 3 emissions.
(13)  Over 99% of the natural gas and 97% of the NGLs processed through our MPLX assets are not owned or marketed by MPLX. Scope 3 emissions from processed volumes owned by third parties were 188 million tonnes of CO2e in 2019 and 191 million 
tonnes of CO2e in 2020.

LEADING IN SUSTAINABILITY(14) As reported in the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) Program.  
(15) 2020 water recycle data not comparable to prior years due to enhanced water accounting that arose from the Focus on Water program that was launched in 2020.      
(16) The legal or regulatory frameworks used to define hazardous waste and recycled hazardous waste is 40 CFR 260-261 .          
(17) Volume of spills in Unusually Sensitive Areas is inclusive of PHMSA-reportable spills only. 
(18)  MPC conforms to inspection frequency requirements contained in 40 CFR 195.452(j)(3). Non-regulated pipelines are not included. Metric reflects % of natural gas pipelines or hazardous liquid pipelines inspected that were scheduled to be inspected in 
2020. This equates to 18.1% of our natural gas pipelines and 19.3% of our hazardous liquid pipelines.          
(19)   DEIs include three categories of environmental incidents: releases to the environment (air, land or water), environmental permit exceedances and agency enforcement actions. Does not include Retail. Tier 3 and 4 DEIs are the most significant types of DEIs. 
 DEI performance is only inclusive of assets/entities that MPC owned in the reporting year. Andeavor assets included in 2018.
(20)  The USGS Protected Areas Database v.2.1 is the nation’s official inventory of public open space and private protected areas and was used to determine areas of protected conservation status. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Critical Habitat, US 
FWS National Wildlife Refuge and US Endangered Species Habitat data sets were used to determine areas of endangered species habitat. As MPC’s operations are limited to the U.S., these two datasets are appropriate for the evaluation of this metric 
in place of the references suggested in the standard.           
(21)  Includes land impacted during the 2020 reporting year. Disturbed land is defined as that which required regulatory review and subsequent permitting (1 acre or greater) OR was identified within an otherwise environmentally sensitive area. 
Disturbed land does not include either (1) previously disturbed agricultural fields, (2) pipeline work on our current (previously disturbed) right-of-way, or (3) right-of-way maintenance vegetation clearing on previously disturbed land required by PHMSA to 
enable aerial pipeline inspections.                
(22) Includes Marathon Petroleum Foundation dollars.
(23)  To present comparable year over year data, the data presented for Count of Safety Incidents does not include COVID-19 cases that MPC conservatively recorded as work-related. Including these cases Refining Count of Employee Safety Incidents is 44, 
MPLX Count of Employee Safety Incidents is 92, and Retail Count of Safety Incidents is 557 .
(24)  To present comparable year over year data, the data presented for Fatalities does not include COVID-19 cases that MPC conservatively recorded as work-related. Including these cases Total Company Employee Fatalities is 1 and Total Company Employee 
Fatality Rate is .004.
(25)  To present comparable year over year data, the data presented for OSHA Recordable Incident Rate does not include COVID-19 cases that MPC conservatively recorded as work-related. Including these cases Total Company (excluding retail) Employee 
OSHA Recordable Incident Rate is .60, Refining Employee OSHA Recordable Incident Rate is .39, MPLX Employee OSHA Recordable Incident Rate is 1 .13, and Retail Employee OSHA Recordable Incident Rate is 1 .76.
(26)  To present comparable year over year data, the data presented for Days Away does not include COVID-19 cases that MPC conservatively recorded as work-related. Including these cases Total Company (excluding retail) Employee Days Away is .31, 
Refining Employee Days Away Rate is .26, MPLX Employee Days Away Rate is .49, and Retail Employee Days Away Rate is 1 .04.
(27) Total Count of Health Illnesses include COVID-19 related health illnesses.
(28)  In May 2007 , the Kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against MPC and Speedway LLC in state court in Franklin County, Kentucky, for alleged violations of Kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws following Hurricanes Katrina 
and Rita in 2005. The lawsuit alleged that we overcharged customers by $89 million USD during September and October 2005. The complaint sought disgorgement of these sums, as well as penalties, under Kentucky’s emergency pricing and 
consumer protection laws. In May 2011, the Kentucky attorney general amended his complaint to include a request for immediate injunctive relief as well as unspecified damages and penalties related to our wholesale gasoline pricing in April and 
May 2011 under statewide price controls that were activated by the Kentucky governor on April 26, 2011 and which have since expired. The court denied the attorney general’s request for immediate injunctive relief. In July 2019, MPC and the attorney 
general reached a settlement to resolve this litigation, which included a payment of $22.5 million USD. We disputed the allegations made against us by the attorney general's office and expressly denied any liability, wrongdoing or violation of the law. 
With this resolution the attorney general's office acknowledged no admission of liability or wrongdoing. Press releases on this settlement by both MPC and the Kentucky attorney general’s office can be found at http://ir.marathonpetroleum.com/file/
Index?KeyFile=398985240 and https://kentucky.gov/Pages/Activity-stream.aspx?n=AttorneyGeneral&prId=807 , respectively. We recommended that settlement funds be used for the purpose of improving rural roads, navigable waterways, and/or 
emergency management to mitigate the impact of weather events.             Notes continued
