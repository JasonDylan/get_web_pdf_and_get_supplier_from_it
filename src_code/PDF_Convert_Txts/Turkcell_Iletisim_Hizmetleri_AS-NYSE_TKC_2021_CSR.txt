Message from Chairman 
of the Board
Bülent Aksu
Chairman of the Board
Turkcell pioneers 
digitalization in all 
aspects of lifeDear Stakeholders,
As Turkcell family, we left behind a 
year, where we continued our business 
in line with our goal of creating 
sustainable value, with the awareness 
of the importance of operating in an 
economically and strategically crucial 
industry, and our responsibility to 
the entire Turkcell ecosystem. While 
strengthening our infrastructure with 
a focused approach throughout 
the year, we kept on providing our 
customers with the highest quality 
products and services through ongoing 
investments for the latest technologies. 
In a time, when digitalization played 
an increasingly predominant role in 
our daily life, we continued to develop 
innovative solutions for evolving 
needs and demands, and make those 
available for our customers. 
With vaccination gathering speed, 2021 
turned a year, where recovery from 
the COVID-19 pandemic started and 
daily life swiftly took on a normalization 
trend across the countries we operated 
in just like the rest of the world. We 
continued our operations, knowing 
it was our corporate responsibility 
to deliver uninterrupted and quality 
communication services to our 
customers. Prioritizing the continuity of 
our operations as our key responsibility, 
we provided leverage in operations and 
digital transformations of all sectors 
also in this period. We ended another 
successful year with sustainable 
and profitable growth driven by our 
operations. 
Our solid financial performance 
allowed us to share the benefits of our 
achievements with our shareholders 
and investors also in 2021. Accordingly, 
at the Ordinary General Assembly An accelerated digitalization trend 
driven by the COVID-19 pandemic 
recently revealed the key role played 
by telecommunications operators in 
this area. As Turkcell, we adopted the 
mission to add value to digitalization 
journeys of our customers through our 
ever-developing competencies and 
strong ecosystem, and enrich their 
lives with technology. In this respect, 
we assist with the digitalization 
journeys of four countries, where we 
have operations, giving them a global 
competitive edge. While we open 
the gates of the digital world to our 
customers with services providing high 
quality and high-speed connectivity, 
we also meet digital demands of 
both consumers and institutions and 
organizations through a broad portfolio 
of products and services developed 
by Turkcell engineers locally. Running 
on Turkcell's solid infrastructure, all of 
these services help keep the data of 
Turkey within Turkey. We make these 
innovative services available to our 
customers through our digital services, 
digital business services and techfin 
businesses, which are our strategic 
focus areas.
As part of our focus on our digital 
services, we continue to lead the 
digital transformation of our country 
with instant messaging, TV and music 
platforms, personal cloud services, 
search engine and email services, 
which we offer to our customers. By 
courtesy of our customers, the number 
of users of these services continue to 
grow. Downloaded over 37 million times 
locally and globally in 2021, our instant 
messaging service BiP had over 90 
million downloads so far. dated April 15, 2021, it was resolved to 
distribute a gross dividend of TRY 2.6 
billion to our shareholders. We thus 
distributed 61% of our net income in 
2020 as dividends to our shareholders 
in 2021. This strong dividend distribution 
performance stands out as a reflection 
of our robust balance sheet, successful 
operations and prudent financial risk 
management approach. 
We carried on our investments with 
the aspiration to bring the latest 
technologies to our country and other 
geographies we operate in, thereby 
providing assistance along their 
digitalization journey with end-to-end 
solutions. With an investment of TRY 
11.5 billion in 2021, our total investments 
from our foundation to date now 
exceeded TRY 75 billion. This year, we 
adopted a smart investment approach 
enabling us to review the feedback 
and needs of the network, finance, 
sales and marketing functions with 
a holistic approach when planning 
our investments. This project aims to 
enable us to plan capital expenditure 
more effectively in order to elevate 
our Company’s cash flow generation 
capability to higher levels. 
In the upcoming period, we will 
promote sustainable development and 
continue our investments to improve 
people's welfare through technology 
and digitalization across the territories 
we do business in as well as developing 
innovative products and services, which 
are well-suited to the meaning of 
Turkcell brand, and our responsibility to 
our customers.

over TRY 2.5 billion to date. We will 
be working towards our goal of 
bolstering up the competitive position 
of our country in data transportation 
and storage with our data center 
investments to take place in the 
forthcoming period.
Healthcare is another sector where 
digitalization is in the spotlight. As 
Turkcell, we play a leading role in the 
digital transformation of our country in 
healthcare, as well. We built the digital 
infrastructure of city hospitals, the 
largest healthcare investments of our 
country, with the "Hospital Information 
Management System" developed by 
Turkcell engineers. Going forward, 
we also target to export this digital 
infrastructure, which is installed in 7 city 
hospitals. We thus aim to represent our 
country successfully on international 
platforms in the healthcare industry.
Rapidly changing payment habits all 
around the world put more emphasis 
on digital solutions in this area. We In order for Turkey to stay ahead of the 
competition in the digitalizing world, 
real fiber needs to be delivered to all 
households in our country. As Turkcell, 
we increased our fiber infrastructure 
investments to accelerate the 
digitalization process of our country, 
and bring high speed and quality fiber 
internet to our users in all parts of 
Turkey. By adding 653 thousand fiber 
homepasses in 2021, we increased our 
total fiber homepasses to 4.5 million. 
We see our fiber infrastructure as 
a critical factor in meeting evolving 
user needs following the COVID-19 
pandemic and filling the shortcomings 
in the digital transformation process 
of our country completely. With this 
perspective, we aim to increase the 
number of our homepasses in the 
upcoming years.
We continue our efforts in the 5G 
technology, which will open a new 
page in the digital transformation 
journey of our country in the 
upcoming years, through international 
partnerships while supporting the 
local ecosystem, as well. To make this 
technology accessible to our customers 
in the most efficient and fastest way, 
we lead several local and global test 
projects, and continue our preparations 
in different areas of usage based on 
our experience from these projects. 
Believing that Turkcell's existing world-
class 4.5G infrastructure will facilitate 
this transformation, we aim to deliver 
the best service to our country with in 
this new era as well. 
While bringing out new industries, 
the digital transformation process 
also results in radical changes in the 
existing industries. In the automotive 
industry, which currently experiences 
this transformation, we observe 
that the gap between conventional 
manufacturers and technology 
companies is rapidly closing, and 
that companies, which successfully 
implement mobility and intelligent 
transportation solutions, gain a 
competitive edge. Developed by As the one and only Turkish company 
listed on both Borsa Istanbul and the 
New York Stock Exchange since 2000, 
we comply with the requirements of 
both Turkish and U.S. capital markets, 
and consistently improve our processes 
by adopting best practices in corporate 
governance. Forming an Integrated 
Value Creation Committee last year, 
we began overseeing our sustainability 
activities more closely through an 
integrated perspective. Accordingly, 
annual performance evaluation of 
Board of Directors' was also an item on 
our agenda. In line with our perspective 
of improving our corporate governance, 
the first evaluation was completed 
this year. Regular self-assessments by 
our Board of Directors will provide a 
basis for building the infrastructure for 
more advanced corporate governance 
practices at the Board level. I value 
the evaluations made by our Board of 
Directors, which has already adopted a 
holistic corporate governance approach 
that embraces all our stakeholders 
thanks to the valuable contributions of 
our independent members, who have 
different areas of expertise, experience 
and competencies at the national and 
international level, both at the Board 
of Directors and at its committees. 
Another significant development 
about corporate governance was the As Turkcell, we build all of our processes 
on sustainability principles and 
positively contribute to the society and 
environment we live in. We work to 
ensure that the environmental, social 
and governance dimensions of our 
business are universally valuable in 
every sense and at all times. 
While supplying all the energy we 
use from 100% renewable resources 
as part of our efforts in combatting 
climate crisis, as a company generating 
renewable energy, we also make 
additional investments and aim to 
become carbon-neutral by 2050. Using 
our technological competencies, we 
develop solutions for all segments 
of our society to have access to the 
benefits of the digital world. We 
embrace ethical values across the 
entire Turkcell ecosystem and urge all 
our stakeholders to adopt these values. 
Last year, we acquired Boyut Grup 
Enerji, which owned Izmir Karadag 
Wind Power Plant to reinforce our 
sustainability approach and get 
one step closer to our 2050 target. 
Transforming Turkcell into a company 
generating renewable energy, this 
acquisition has empowered our 
sustainability initiative. In addition to this 
investment, we generated 2.200 MWh 
of electricity in 2021 with the 5 solar 
energy projects we own. In 2021, we 
supplied 100% of the energy consumed 
across Turkcell Group from renewable 
energy sources.leverage our Paycell brand to make 
services available for our users in the 
simplest and most secure way possible 
as the leader of innovations in payment 
systems. We differentiate from the 
competition through innovative 
solutions delivered in different verticals 
on our "Super App" which addresses all 
financial transaction needs of our users. 
While growing our number of users 
with extensive and diverse services 
we offer, we also focus on acquiring 
more merchants through our payment 
facilitation services and solutions to 
expand the coverage of Paycell and 
support our growth performance. 
With Financell, another focus of ours 
in techfin, we meet the needs of our 
customers in financing their purchases 
of phones and tablets. To increase the 
number of customers of Financell, we 
also offer our corporate customers 
various financing solutions in a manner 
that will support our performance in our 
strategic focus areas. 
In 2021, while meeting the digital 
solution needs of  our customers 
with our products and services, we 
also continued digitalization of our 
own internal processes. We steadily 
kept increasing revenue share of our 
digital sales channel, which increased 
to 22% on a 4 point rise compared 
to the previous year, thanks to the 
sales realized through our digital 
operator application, website and 
electronic marketplace Turkcell 
Pasaj. We intensively concentrate on 
digitalization of our sales channels for 
both uninterrupted service delivery to 
our customers and savings in selling 
expenses. In the forthcoming period, 
we will continue working towards 
increasing the revenue share of the 
digital sales channel.
Our digital and analytical competencies 
hold a prominent place in our 
marketing and sales operations as well. 
Leveraging this, we are able to make 
customized offers to our customers 
at the right time and at the right price 
level.  Ensuring our customers receive 
the right offer with the right price on 
one hand leads us to reinforce the 
customer loyalty to our brand. As a 
result of these efforts, our customer 
loyalty rate improved by 0.3 points in 
2021 compared to the previous year.
While managing our infrastructure, 
we efficiently direct the traffic across 
our network by using our digital 
competencies, and optimize network 
investments in this respect. At the same time, we keep virtualizing our network. 
Virtualization rate was over 60% in 2021 
in our mobile and fixed networks. All of 
these efforts pay off with efficiency in 
our investments. 
Another remarkable development 
resulting from our digitalization 
efforts was the completion of the 
establishment of our software 
company Atmosware in 2021. Today, 
we have a new world and a new 
economy evolving around technology 
and digitalization. In this new period, 
we prioritize software development, 
one of the key elements which will 
help us maintain our leading position. 
By establishing this company, we aim 
to develop software products and 
services and bridge the skill gap in our 
country by specifically training software 
developers for this purpose. 
Furthermore, we launched the 
"Developers of the Future - Investment 
for Youth, Software for Future" initiative 
in partnership with the Ministry of 
National Education as part of our 
goal of contributing to the software 
ecosystem of our country. With this 
training program initiated in Turkey for 
the first time, we aspire to educate 
young people for the software world, 
improve their coding competencies, 
and, as a result, provide skilled 
workforce to the domestic software 
ecosystem. Young software developers, 
who complete the program and pass 
tests, will get the opportunity to join 
Turkcell and group companies as 
well as Turkcell's software company 
Atmosware. Those who attend the 
program will be one step further to 
secure a position in other companies, 
as well, thanks to the professional 
competence certification provided on 
completion of the program.
Aware of the importance of information 
security, we established an advanced 
level of measures for data privacy 
and security, which would ensure 
compliance with the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) applying 
to our services, which we offer in 
European Union countries, as well as 
the personal data protection legislation 
and the laws of our country applying 
to our products and services. As part of 
the Personal Data Compliance Program, 
we prepare and release required 
policies and procedures and identify 
new requirements through regular 
evaluations with the Personal Data 
Steering Committee.We invest in the 
infrastructure of our 
country in the digital 
transformation process
We adopt best practices 
in corporate governanceWe took major steps 
in our journey to 
sustainabilityTurkey’s Automobile Joint Venture 
Group Inc., Togg offers innovative 
solutions embracing global trends 
in this field by converting data to 
controlled and safe autonomous 
drive. While Togg will differentiate the 
driving experience of its users with the 
ecosystem it will create around the 
smart vehicle, as Turkcell, we anticipate 
contributing to this ecosystem with 
our technological competencies. We 
prioritize the integration of in-vehicle 
passenger analysis systems, primarily 
including face recognition and emotion 
analysis, and Turkcell's digital and 
techfin services with the e-mobility 
ecosystem. Considering the potential 
Togg offers and the synergy it creates 
with our technological competencies, 
we are pleased to have increased our 
shareholding in Togg from 19% to 23%. 
With the production expected to start 
in 2022, we foresee that this potential 
will materialize and create value for all 
of our stakeholders.  establishment of our Strategy and 
Digitalization Committee in early 2022 
to help our Board of Directors perform 
oversight responsibility by providing 
consultancy on strategy, digitalization 
and efficiency. I wholeheartedly believe 
all of these developments will carry 
the transparent stance of Turkcell, 
guided by best practices in corporate 
governance, to more advanced levels.
Our Board of Directors will continue 
to implement the most effective and 
optimal internal governance tools 
and procedures to address potential 
conflicts of interest for the benefit of all 
stakeholders. 29 28ABOUT

We do not take sustainability from an 
environmental sustainability perspective 
only. For us, sustainability means 
minimizing our direct and indirect 
negative outputs, creating positive 
value, and adopting this approach to 
all of our stakeholders. With that goal 
in mind, we have been implementing 
social inclusion projects that aim 
to provide equal opportunities for 
everyone since our foundation. We 
develop projects that will spread 
social equality in every sense by using 
technology without excluding anybody, 
such as My Sign Language application, 
Women Developers of the Future, 
Recycle into Education, Education 
Without Boundaries Program as part of 
People without Boundaries project, My 
Gem Inside, Sports without Boundaries 
and My Dream Companion application 
made available to all operators free of 
charge. We attach great importance to 
building digital skills in next generations, 
who will ensure the development of 
our country. Accordingly, we opened 
25 new classrooms in 2021 as part of 
the Whiz Kids project we launched to 
improve the technological capabilities 
of talented students in cooperation 
with the Ministry of National Education. 
Within the scope of this project that 
is preparing our country for the future 
in the digital transformation area, 
we equipped Whiz Kids Technology 
Classrooms with a broad range of 
technological equipment including 
laptops, 3D printers, smart boards, 
electronic and robotic coding kits. This 
training currently enables 200 thousand 
students we reached through 70 Whiz 
Kids classrooms opened in 42 cities, to 
develop projects in AI, coding, space 
sciences, robotics, smart homes, and 
cloud technologies. 
Over the last year, we experienced 
heartbreaking times reminding us of the 
significance of the fight against climate 
change. Unfortunately, we were deeply 
saddened by the wildfires and floods 
that took place in summer. As Turkcell, 
we used every means available to us 
and worked relentlessly. While taking 
precautions to facilitate and maintain 
uninterrupted communication across 
disaster areas, we also donated 50 
thousand saplings for reforestation of 
the areas affected by wildfires. 
We set targets and hired people based 
on our equal pay for equal work policy 
to increase the number of women employees and women executives at 
Turkcell. We continued working towards 
our goal of becoming the top employer 
with a focus on gender equality.
In 2021, we announced our "Sustainable 
Governance Principles" that regulates 
the compliance with our human rights 
and environmental policies, which we 
drew up to place our sustainability 
approach on solid grounds and make it 
permanent. We pledged to do business 
by contributing to the UN's Sustainable 
Development Goals with our 15 
principles, which regulate the rules of 
our communication and interaction 
with all our stakeholders, reinforcing our 
"Turkcell for a Better World" discourse. 
We are committed to our 
principles to deliver value 
for our stakeholders
I would like to extend my sincere thanks 
to our customers for their interest in our 
products and services, our shareholders 
for their trust, our business partners 
and all stakeholders and especially our 
employees, who have enabled us to 
carry out our operations successfully in 
2021. 
Going forward, we will continue to 
work with all our strength by keeping 
value creation for all our stakeholder 
groups that make up the Turkcell 
ecosystem at the center of our 
operations. Focusing on the social 
benefit with our strong infrastructure, 
technology investments, innovative 
services and solutions, increasing the 
welfare of all regions that we operate 
in and the people living in there, 
particularly in our country, will continue 
to be our main agenda item.

Message from Chief 
Executive Officer
Murat Erkan
Chief Executive Officer
We continued our 
successful performance 
through our diversified 
business model based on 
our strategic focus areasWe increased subscriber 
net additions with our 
customer focusDear Stakeholders, 
2021 was marked by a recovery 
period across the globe following the 
socially and economically challenging 
conditions that prevailed in 2020 due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the 
first half of the year, the measures 
taken against the pandemic continued 
to affect social life and business 
activities. However, in the second half 
of the year, following the widespread 
vaccination campaigns, we went 
through a period, where restrictions 
were gradually eased, and daily life 
and economic activities became 
increasingly normalized in our country 
in parallel to the majority of the world. 
While pandemic-fueled digitalization 
maintained its significance both in daily 
and business activities, a significant 
portion of evolving customer behaviors 
proved to be permanent.
As Turkcell family, we sustained our 
operations based on a people-
oriented approach in line with our 
goal of delivering value for all of our 
stakeholders in 2021. We kept delivering 
innovative solutions to address the 
needs of our customers through 
a broad portfolio of products and 
services, and worked towards creating 
inclusive and sustainable benefits. With 
our strategic focus areas of digital 
services, digital business services and 
techfin, we carried on offering services 
that suited to the evolving habits and 
growing digital solution requirements of 
our customers.In this period, where the digitalization 
requirement stressed the importance 
of the telecommunications industry 
once again, we were able to meet 
the evolving needs of our customers 
fully through our robust infrastructure 
and extensive digital services. Thus, 
facilitating the lives of our customers, 
we successfully did our share in the 
digital transformation process to In 2021, economic growth recovered 
across the globe with the easing in 
pandemic restrictions and vaccination 
becoming widely spread. We leveraged 
our customer-oriented approach, 
diversified business model and digital-
based strategy, and maintained 
our solid financial and operational 
performance in 2021.
Strong performance of our services and 
solutions in meeting the evolving needs 
of our customers helped us deliver 
robust financial results exceeding our 
guidance, which we upgraded each 
quarter in 2021. Turkcell's consolidated 
revenues reached TRY 35.9 billion, with 
an increase of 23.4% compared to the 
previous year. Consolidated EBITDA 
rose to TRY 15.0 billion, with an increase 
of 22.4%. Having increased by 18.7% 
compared to the previous year, net 
income was TRY 5.0 billion. Operational 
capex to sales ratio (excluding 
licenses) was realized at 21.2% in line 
with our plans. Our strong balance 
sheet, prudent risk management 
approach, and consequently profitable 
operations allowed us to distribute our 
shareholders a gross dividend of TRY 
2.6 billion in 2021.provide competitive advantage to our 
country in the international arena. 
In 2021, we observed that the changing 
consumer habits during the pandemic 
started to become permanent. 
While pandemic measures had a 
negative impact on mobility in the 
first half of the year, mobility and 
tourism activities, which increased 
as a result of eased restrictions, 
helped boost the demand for our 
mobile business in the second half. 
We registered 1.7 million net postpaid 
subscriber additions in 2021 through 
strong investment in our infrastructure, 
customer-oriented approach and 
our focus on expanding our postpaid 
subscriber base. Accordingly, the share 
of our postpaid subscribers in our total 
mobile subscribers reached to 66.4%. 
We registered net mobile subscriber 
additions of 2.2 million growing our 
total mobile subscriber base to 35.6 
million and further increasing our 
market share. Mobile blended ARPU 
(excluding M2M) reached TRY 54.9 on 
13.4% growth thanks to higher postpaid 
subscriber base, rising data and digital 
services usage, our upselling strategy, 
and price adjustments. With our offers 
based on our analytic competencies 
and our customer-oriented approach, 
we continued to improve our customer 
retention performance. Monthly 
average mobile churn was 2.0%, 
indicating to a 0.3% improvement on a 
yearly basis. 
Given the lower fiber penetration 
rate in Turkey compared to the 
OECD countries, we expanded our 
fiber infrastructure to transform the 
increasing demand following changing 
consumer habits into value for our 
stakeholders and accelerate the digital 
transformation process of our country.

We met growing digital 
needs of our customers 
with our three strategic 
focus areasWe continued our 
investments to support 
the technological 
breakthrough in our 
country
We are well on the 
way towards our 
sustainability goalsWe are creating a digital 
ecosystemThis resulted in net 223 thousand fiber 
subscriber additions, bringing our 
fixed subscriber base to 2.7 million. 
Residential fiber ARPU grew by 10.6% 
reaching TRY 78.4 through upsells and 
price adjustments. Also, our IPTV service 
TV+, differentiated from competition 
with rich content, reached 1.1 million 
subscribers with 211 net additions.
We recorded 2.7 million net subscriber 
additions in 2021 thanks to our 
value-driven and customer-oriented 
approach. Accordingly, we delivered 
the strongest subscriber net addition 
performance of the last 14 years 
despite the challenging conditions.  
The digitalization steps that we have 
been taking for a long period of 
time in accordance with the evolving 
customer habits also supported the 
strong performance we achieved 
in a challenging period. With our 
omnichannel approach, we offer 
quality and inclusive services to our 
customers through our physical and 
digital channels and allow all our 
businesses to leverage this channel 
structure. Our digital sales channel 
taking on heightened importance 
among other Turkcell channels each 
day enabled us to maintain our bond 
and communication with our customers 
in any condition. The share of our digital 
channel in consumer revenues rose to 
22% at the end of 2021. Additionally, 
we have kicked off our channel 
transformation project this year, which 
will enable us to serve our customers 
in a holistic manner, as well as creating 
cost saving opportunities by optimizing 
our physical, digital and tele sales 
channels.  
This year, we continued to assist the 
digital transformation of our country 
through our digital services including 
BiP, TV+, fizy, lifebox and Dergilik, all 
developed by Turkish engineers and 
all considered cornerstone brands of 
Turkcell ecosystem. While the number 
of paid users of our digital services 
reached 4 million increasing 35%, our 
digital services standalone revenue 
grew 31%. Our communication and life 
platform BiP was downloaded over The COVID-19 pandemic underlined 
the importance of high speed and 
quality internet connections once 
again. In addition to communication, 
we now started carrying out business 
activities, educational activities, 
shopping transactions and many other 
daily activities digitally over internet. 
Accordingly, as Turkcell, we accelerated 
our investments to bring the real fiber 
quality to every corner of Turkey. We 
are aware that digitalization of our 
country will take place through the 
high speed and capacity enabled by 
fiber internet. We added 653 thousand 
new homepasses this year with fiber 
mobilization project that we launched 
for a digitized Turkey. The number of 
households under our fiber coverage 
reached 4.5 million. We are aware 
of the fact that fiber investments are 
critically important for transition to 5G 
technology. We take it as a national 
matter to focus on fiber investments, a 
cornerstone of digital transformation 
process, which would provide our 
country an advantageous position in 
global competition, and aim to sustain 
this focus in the forthcoming years as 
well.
We intend to turn our country into 
a base for data by combining the With our goal of transforming our 
services, which have been developed 
with a focus on people's evolving 
needs, into an ecosystem under 
Turkcell brand, we kicked off our new 
communication strategy and corporate 
brand transformation in 2021 with 
our campaign "May the World Be 
Yours". We positioned all of our digital 
services and solutions as independent 
brands in Turkcell portfolio as part of 
our strategy to shape Turkcell as a 
digital ecosystem brand, beyond being 
a telecommunications operator. Our 
new ecosystem approach enables 
users of any of our digital brands to 
leverage the coverage of the Turkcell 
ecosystem independent of their Turkcell 
subscription.
As Turkcell, we improve our technology 
for a better world with our people-
oriented and ecological way of 
doing business. Aware of the benefits 
provided by digitalization for reducing 
carbon emissions and using energy 
efficiently, we deliver sustainable, smart 
and environmentally-friendly services 
developed by Turkcell engineers. We 90 million times while the number 
of 3-month active users reached 26 
million, reaching 2.5 times that of last 
year. We aim to turn BiP into a widely-
used platform through partnerships 
with international operators planned 
for the foreseeable future. Our internet-
based digital TV platform TV+ had 
a remarkable year as it reached 1.1 
million users thanks to its enriched 
content offer. We added value to our 
customers by offering this service to 
65% of our residential fiber subscriber 
base. Providing a secure and fast 
cloud storage service for users, lifebox 
reached 1.3 million paid users. In 2021, 
we took a major step in accessing 
more customers by making our BiP 
Meet, lifebox business, fizy business and 
YaaniMail Corporate products available 
for our corporate customers as part of 
the B2B business model.
In 2021, we recorded an increase of 
29% in revenues of our digital business 
services, which enable our corporate 
customers to gain a competitive edge 
by accompanying their end-to-end 
digital transformation. We were able 
to meet the growing digitalization 
demand of our customers by providing 
comprehensive services in data center 
and cloud solutions, cybersecurity, 
system integration and managed 
services, business applications and next 
generation technologies in addition 
to our traditional telecommunication 
services. We led digital transformation 
of our corporate customers through 
more than 2.700 projects with a 
contract value of TRY 1.7 billion in 2021. 
In system integration and managed 
services projects, we have a backlog 
of TRY 1.4 billion which will convert 
into revenues in 2022 and beyond. We 
helped organizations manage their 
digital transformation processes more 
efficiently by expanding our services 
this year. In addition to our value-
added services, we realize digital 
transformation projects through vertical 
solutions that appeal to the specific 
needs of each sector. Our consultants 
with specific sector expertise allow 
us to analyze our customers in the 
industries we focus on, including 
healthcare, education, production, retail, 
finance, logistics, energy, tourism, SMEs 
and central and local administrations, 
with a 360-degree approach, and 
present projects that will provide 
our customers a competitive edge. 
Along with this approach, our strong performance in 2021 led us to become 
the market leader. We intend to build 
up our competencies and maintain 
our robust performance in this 
strategic focus area to accompany our 
corporate customers throughout their 
digitalization journey.  
Our techfin business, which includes 
Financell and Paycell brands, had a 
successful year. We registered TRY 1.1 
billion in revenues in this focus area on a 
27% year-on-year increase. Contraction 
in loan portfolio of Financell came 
to an end in 2021 and its revenues 
grew by 9% with the contribution of 
our insurance subsidiary. Additionally, 
Paycell performed brilliantly in meeting 
user requirements with its broad 
portfolio of products in a period, when 
payment habits changed and digital 
payment services became prominent. 
It maintained its performance with 
a revenue growth of 64% in 2021. 
Adopting a vision of becoming a 
"Super App" with service offering in a 
number of verticals, Paycell reached 
6.6 million 3-month active users. "Pay 
Later" service, allowing reflection of 
spending to Turkcell bills, grew by 
93% and reached a volume of TRY 
1.8 billion. Meanwhile, Paycell Card 
transaction volume reached 6 times 
that of previous year. Paycell also 
started to extend its physical and virtual 
POS services to increase its member 
merchants and promote growth. The 
number of users of Paycell's Android 
POS terminals reached 6 thousand. 
Moreover, Paycell integrated 75 
e-commerce websites as well as 
Turkcell channels as part of the virtual 
POS service, which targets to convert 
the strong growth in e-commerce into 
an advantage. Transaction volume 
carried out through our POS products 
reached TRY 1.6 billion in 2021.
We also started a partial stake sale 
process in Paycell, which improves its 
products and services and maintains its 
strong performance along with growing 
demand. As part of these efforts, we 
look for a strategic partner who, with 
its know-how in techfin services, will 
contribute to the growth of Paycell in 
existing and new markets and help 
us carry Paycell to the next level. We 
believe this will both assist Paycell in 
growing its business volume and unlock 
its real value. 
While making lives of our customers easier with the digital solutions we 
develop, we also keep our focus 
on digitalization of our internal 
processes. We support our solutions, 
which leads to incremental revenue 
generation potential, with several 
cost-optimization initiatives and create 
higher and sustainable value for our 
shareholders. Accordingly, as the leader 
of digitalization, we started a new 
transformation project this year, where 
we target to re-shape each channel 
that we contact with our customers, 
our technological infrastructure, our 
way of doing business and internal 
processes with a focus on digitalization. 
With this project, we aim to contribute 
to personalized, end-to-end and 
flawless customer experience, increase 
operational efficiency, as well as 
completely adopting our organization 
to the digital age. geographical advantage of Turkey, a 
transition point for internet traffic, with 
cutting-edge technology solutions at 
hand, and keep our data within our 
national borders. With this goal in 
mind, we added a new data center 
to our existing portfolio of 7 with 
the inauguration of the Europe Data 
Center, consolidating our leadership in 
data storage and cloud technologies. 
Standing out with a domestic product 
usage rate of 75%, built to the world 
standards, and equipped with state-
of-the-art technology, the Europe 
Data Center has a white space of 7 
thousand 238 square meters. Through 
this investment, we have increased 
the total of white space of our data 
centers to 40 thousand square meters.
We continue to strengthen our 
powerful mobile network, which 
is positioned at the center of our 
business, and deliver the highest 
quality services to our customers. We 
provide services on a 24/7 basis with 
a field force of 1,300 well-equipped 
and specialized employees across 
the country to address the changing 
demand conditions. We have a mobile 
communication network, which is cited 
as exemplary globally due to our wide 
spectrum and well-planned modern 
infrastructure. The latest Global Status 
Report of the Global Mobile Suppliers 
Association (GSA) named Turkcell as 
the fastest operator of Europe and one 
of the top three operators globally with 
1.6 Gbps speed delivered through our 
4.5G network. We are committed to 
providing our customers with quality 
services setting global examples and 
making investments. 
In the coming years, one of the major 
changes to take place in technology 
in our country will be 5G. Digital 
transformation process will gain speed 
in our country with this new technology, 
which will facilitate implementation 
of innovations in the sphere of IoT, 
smart cities, autonomous vehicles and 
production technologies. To make 
this technology available for our 
customers at its best, we take part in 
local and international test programs 
and continue to work to get ready 
for the transition. We successfully 
completed the four-year-long 5G 
testing project realized by the Next 
Generation Mobile Networks Alliance 
(NGMN) in partnership with prominent 
telecommunication companies of the world and led by Turkcell. While 
assisting in the establishment of global 
standards with this project, we also 
gained significant experience that will 
enable us to provide our customers 
with a strong service in the future. 
While we continued our efforts in the 
international arena, we also brought 
5G roaming service to our customers. 
Turkcell customers can experience 
this service in 38 contracted countries 
without additional charges. 
We launched this year the LTE-M 
technology allowing for major 
developments in intelligent 
transportation systems, autonomous 
delivery, healthcare information, 
inventory tracking as part of 
our aspiration to bring the latest 
communication technologies to our 
subscribers. Making communication 
between things much more efficient, 
LTE-M will accelerate the digitalization 
process with its use in many areas on 
the way to 5G.41 40ABOUT

work to reduce inequalities through 
the inclusion of entire society with 
our products and services, and offer 
equal access to information. We aim to 
create long-term value by constructing 
our business model on sustainable, 
inclusive and accessible building blocks.
A major step in our sustainability 
efforts in 2021 was the acquisition of 
Boyut Grup Enerji, which owned İzmir 
Karadağ Wind Power Plant. This power 
plant can meet annual electricity 
consumption of 2,500 base stations 
with its installed power capacity of 18 
MW. This acquisition means a giant 
leap in our journey to become a 
company aspiring to achieve not only 
100% renewable energy consumption 
but also renewable energy generation. 
This proved our commitment to our 
goal of going carbon-neutral by 2050. 
With the agreement signed with BNP 
Paribas in December, we increased 
the amount of the loan indexed to 
sustainability goals and originally 
contracted in 2019 to EUR 70 million, 
and extended its term to 5 years.
We carried on executing projects, 
which we lead for a sustainable 
environment. We selected "Climate 
Ideathon" as the theme of this year's 
competition held as part of our 
Women Developers of Future project 
in which we partnered with TOBB. This 
project allowed us to both pioneer 
the development of technological 
solutions for a sustainable environment 
and contribute to the elimination of 
gender inequality in combatting climate 
change by incorporating women in the 
process of solution development.
As Turkcell, we recycle all of our 
electronic waste or make it available 
for reuse. With our Recycle into 
Education Project, we recycle 
electronic waste dropped off at 
Turkcell stores, contributing to efficient 
use of resources. The entire income 
of this operation is donated to 
children's education. We continued 
our efforts related to electronic waste 
management this year as well.
Another significant development of this 
year was our "Flexible Work Model" we 
implemented in cooperation with our 
employees. Our employees are now 
able choose to work remotely or in the 
office. Moreover, they are able to work locally or abroad. This work model aims 
to improve the comfort and efficiency 
of our employees and deliver the best 
working experience possible.
As Turkcell, we attach great importance 
to the accessibility of our technology, 
thus enabling everybody to take part in 
life equally. In this context, we became 
the first company in Turkey and one of 
the first 8 in the world to endorse the 
GSMA's Principles for Driving the Digital 
Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities.
We strive to incorporate all of our 
stakeholders in all these efforts. We 
develop projects and systems to ensure 
the compatibility of all our suppliers 
with our people-oriented and green 
practices and policies. To help them 
internalize sustainability, we train our 
employees, dealers, and subsidiaries, 
organize contests, and partner with 
national and international organizations 
and NGOs.
In 2021, when digitalization kept gaining 
momentum and telecommunication 
services got more and more crucial in 
all aspects of our lives, we delivered 
successful results in all of our businesses 
with innovative solutions centered 
around our customers. I would like 
to take this opportunity to thank all 
of my colleagues for their part in 
our achievements and our Board of 
Directors for their trust and support. 
And I wish to express my gratitude 
once again to our customers and 
business partners who have always 
stood beside us in this journey to 
success.

Turkcell
With our identity of responsible technology provider and our 
business activities, we completed the process of shifting from 
a single-capital business model to a six-capital one last year 
by shaping our business model in the light of opinions from 
all our stakeholders along our value chain and the trends 
affecting the society and the industry.
Leveraging our value creation model, which we have 
designed around our priorities set with an integrated 
perspective, we focus on the value we create for all 
stakeholders by tracking our activities specific to our capitals. 
We closely monitor our main capitals, the value that 
we create, and our social contribution, which we enrich 
through our business operations and core competencies, 
through tangible and measurable performance indicators. 
By integrating our inputs, strategic focus areas and core 
competences that we identified in the context of our value 
creation model and consolidating them with the Turkcell 
sustainability strategy, we ensure that the value we create 
and transformation on these capitals are managed for the 
benefit of all stakeholders.With a history of 28 
years abound with 
achievements, as Turkey’s 
Turkcell, we aim to bring 
the latest technologies to 
our country and people, 
help everyone access life 
equally through digital 
transformation, and 
create value for all of our 
stakeholders including 
our customers primarily 
with our value-added 
products and services in 
the days to come as we 
have done in the past.
As Turkcell, our main goal is to be the leader in every activity 
we carry out. In order to demonstrate the values we create 
in technological, social and environmental areas together 
with the financial value as a whole, and to consolidate our 
leading and exemplary position in the industry by following 
international trends and good practices, we started to use 
integrated reporting as our primary corporate reporting 
tool in 2020. A first among telecommunication companies 
in Turkey, we released our first integrated annual report last 
year. Value creating Turkcell: 
Technology for a better world
With our second Turkcell 
Integrated Annual Report 
released this year, we aim 
to provide the financial, 
environmental, social and 
governance dimensions 
of our efforts in 2021 in a 
holistic manner and convey

As a company which is among the major players of the national and international 
telecommunication industry and cognizant of the leverage of digitalization in terms 
of sustainability, we have a significant potential to create value in this area. Relying 
substantially on electricity to power their networks, telecom operators should turn 
their face to renewable resources to reduce their carbon footprint. Meanwhile, good 
practices around efforts like recycling and refurbishment of devices and reducing 
waste are crucial in the realm of Circular Economy. Furthermore, mobile technologies 
offer great benefits for equality of opportunities among societies, and for access to 
financial, health and education services by expanding smartphone and broadband 
penetration, thereby providing access to various online services such as banking.

and ESG policies by all Turkcell employees, was featured among the Company’s strategic 
goals, and are assigned as Key Performance Indicators for everyone from the Chief Executive 
Officer to all employees. 
All company workers at all levels received training in Sustainability and ESG policies. 
Competitions and awards promoting sustainability were used to reinforce the internalization 
of this training.
Our Company’s ESG KPIs such as gender equality, use of renewable energy, and employee 
training are included in our sustainability reports, which we have published from 2011 to 2020, 
and our integrated reports, which we have started to publish as of 2020. 
We continue to establish systems to closely monitor sub-parameters related to ESG Key 
Performance Indicators. If verifiable data exists, we present such KPIs together with local and 
international sector benchmarks as part of our Sustainability Committee activities.

as the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the 
United Nations Women's Empowerment Principles 
(UN WEPs), and the GSMA's Digital Statement on 
Climate Change. 
Combining the high potential of the industry and Turkcell's superior digital services with the 
Sustainable Development Goals, we monitor our social and environmental impact in the 
short, medium and long run, deliver value, and form Turkcell's sustainability strategy with this 
vision. We identified three main focus areas, i.e., "Environmental Sustainability," "Digital and 
Social Inclusion," and "Ethical and Valuable Operation," as well as the titles of practices we 
implemented as part of these focus areas. You can access more information on our strategic focus areas, core competencies and business

We designed our value 
creation model, which we 
first set forth last year, to 
be able to measure the 
created value concretely and 
convey it to our stakeholders 
transparently. Along the value 
creation process which we 
designed using Turkcell's 
assets, business operations 
and performance indicators 
enriched with its primary 
competences, we moved to 
six-capital business model 
for compliance with the 
IIRC Integrated Reporting 
Framework. In our value creation process, in light of Turkcell’s 
strategic focus areas, sustainability strategy and 
core competencies, we continued integrated thinking 
focused meetings and workshops, we organized 
together with our teams, to reflect their activities and 
capture their interactions with other divisions in 2021. 
We revised our value creation model by analyzing 
new developments around our activities, global and 
national trends, risks and opportunities impacting our 
value creation process and subsequently our way of 
doing business for 2021 as well.
As part of our value creation model, we identify every 
single stakeholder we touch with our activities, and we 
provide a mapping of the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals. Our value creation process

Accordingly, we offer a richer value proposal to our customers 
and meet the digitalization demand of our stakeholders. 
We continue to expand our digital services and offer them 
to a higher number of users. With our digital business 
services, we provide a wide range of services including data 
centers, cloud services, cybersecurity, internet of things (IoT), 
managed services to our corporate customers during their 
digitalization processes. As part of techfin services, which is 
another strategic area of our company, through our successful 
solutions in different verticals, we enable our users to make 
their payments digitally, provide financing which makes 
technological devices and services accessible.
You can find details on our measurable targets for achieving 
success within the scope of our business operations 
conducted in line with our strategic initiatives in the relevant 
sections of this report. Turkcell's short-term, medium-term, 
and long-term target periods were set as 0-1 year, 1-3 years, 
and 3 years or more, respectively.In order to maintain 
our strong operational 
performance and our 
profitable growth, 
we focus on three 
strategic focus areas, 
namely Digital Services 
and Solutions, Digital 
Business Solutions and 
techfin, in addition to 
our core business of 
telecommunication.

*Actual results cannot be guaranteed to meet these estimates and expectations. Please see our 2020 Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, specifically the Risk Factors section, for a discussion of factors that may affect the results. While all of these global innovations and technological 
developments have impact on various sectors in varying 
scales, the telecommunications sector is one of the most 
affected. The telecom companies value the diversity of 
alternative products and services achieved through digital 
transformation while continuing to invest and remain 
profitable in their core business, telecommunications services. 
Accordingly, the demand to our mobile and fixed services, 
which we offer as part of our telecom services, continues to 
increase. We continued to grow in our mobile business, driven 
by increased data usage, upsell efforts, and higher postpaid 
subscriber share as well as our pricing actions. In addition, we 
have grow in fixed segment through expanding subscriber 
base in fiber and IPTV.
We have met our costumers’ increasing demand for our 
mobile and fixed services through new offers and options in 
2021, as well. We've also expanded our Smart Deals and Win-
Win Offers to empower customers who choose to use our 
digital channels more broadly.
Responsiveness to changing customer demands and the 
implementation of necessary solutions were also our 
priorities this year. Our innovations included "GNÇ Bana Göre" Digitalization, along 
with the new business 
models emerged as a 
result of the pandemic’s 
impact on daily life, led 
to innovative solutions 
globally and became 
a key focus area in our 
country, as well. Our telecom business71 70ABOUT

packages with renewed portfolio, and "Turkcell Biz" platform 
with Turkcell privileges jointly used with family or friends. We 
extended “Turkcell Biz” to our prepaid customers, as well. We 
achieved 2.2 million net mobile subscriber additions thanks 
to our strategy of always standing by our customers, while 
delivering innovative and extensive offers and additional 
benefits. Thanks to higher data usage, upsell efforts and 
higher postpaid subscriber base our mobile ARPU (excluding 
M2M) grew by 13.4%.
We have accelerated our fiber infrastructure investments in 
order to meet our customers increasing demand for quality 
and fast internet connection. Accordingly, we have added 653 
thousand homepasses in 2021 and supported our country’s 
digitalization. Thanks to our expanding fiber infrastructure, we 
had 258 thousand net fixed subscriber additions. Our fixed 
residential fiber ARPU rose by 10.6% on our renewed value 
proposition, upsell efforts and higher IPTV subscribers. We span-off BiP, fizy, TV+ and lifebox into separate 
companies to monitor their performances with increased 
focus and create an environment well suited to stand 
out in global competition. These services continue their 
journey faster, stronger and with more focus with their own 
organizational structures. We work relentlessly to turn these 
services, which already receive international interest, into 
success stories globally. While our digital services continue 
to provide digital experiences to users not only in Turkey but 
also in many countries, our engineers continue to develop 
our digital services with dozens of new features which are 
created for the first time in the world. Meanwhile, we also 
offer infrastructure support to keep the data of our services in 
respective countries, respecting each country’s data. 
During this development process, the services that we offer 
to our individual users became corporate platforms where 
companies can store and manage data securely. Institutions 
and organizations are now able to receive digital offerings 
which serve over the cloud from our data centers in Turkey 
and are the most secure against cyber-attacks. We started 
to serve our corporate customers with our digital services in 
2021. We will maintain this approach in the upcoming years. 
As another highlight of this year, we initiated corporate 
brand transformation with our “May the World Be Yours” 
communication strategy. As part of our strategy to evolve 
Turkcell into a digital ecosystem brand that goes far beyond 
being a telecommunication operator, we position our digital 
services and solutions as separate brands under Turkcell 
umbrella. We target to emphasize that we offer a wide range 
of digital services tailored to the needs of our customers at a 
time when consumer habits are changing rapidly. We offer a rich user 
experience thanks to 
the solutions that we 
offer including music 
streaming, TV, personal 
cloud storage, instant 
messaging platform, 
search engine, e-mail, 
digital ad and gaming. 
These services also 
contribute to the ARPU 
of our users, while at the 
same time strengthening 
their loyalty to Turkcell.

As the world's first digital operator, we make our 28-years 
of technology experience available for private enterprises 
of all sizes and public institutions with our services and 
solutions developed based on these organizations' needs 
and expectations. With these solutions we offer, we help 
organizations transform their business models and stay 
ahead of the competition. As digitization gains momentum, 
we provide comprehensive information technology services 
as well as consulting services to our customers from a wide 
range of industries throughout their digital transformation 
journey to address requirements to acquire knowledge and 
skills in this area, and end-to-end information technology 
services. Leveraging our extensive sales network, qualified 
human resource, strong partner ecosystem and superior 
infrastructure, we are resolutely pursuing our goal of 
becoming Turkey’s leading provider of information technology 
and digital solutions.
In addition to an end-to-end fiber infrastructure of 53 
thousand kilometers, we have a total of 8 data centers. 4 
of them are Tier-3 Design and Operational Sustainability 
certified by the Uptime Institute, an international certification 
body. There is 40 thousand m2 of white space in our data 
centers. Turkcell Cloud services provides a more flexible 
infrastructure while reducing costs by hosting an institution's 
entire information technology infrastructure in a Turkcell 
data center. The cloud service, provided through completely 
redundant 8 data centers, has obtained ISO 27017 Cloud 
Information Safety Certification, confirming our information 
security competence. This makes us the first and only service 
provider in Turkey holding this certification. We launched 
“Public Institutions Cloud” in order to serve the public 
sector in accordance with the Presidency Information and 
Communication Security Measures Circular and the guide 
published accordingly. 
In the cyber security field, another component of our digital 
transformation, we protect corporates against cyber threats 
through our FIRST and OICCERT member Security Operation 
Center, consultancy services such as penetration tests and 
vulnerability analyses, and a large cyber security product 
portfolio. With Bozok Cyber Threat Intelligence platform 
integrated with the security operation center as a cyber 
security protection layer, we provide our customers with 
threat information when they require. We 
deliver penetration test and vulnerability 
analysis service to our customers using new 
tools and methods to enable organizations to 
determine their cyber security requirements 
and perform security gap scans and 
penetration tests for major institutions.
With the Turkcell IoT Platform, we allow 
businesses to manage their devices and 
machines remotely via the cloud without 
incurring infrastructure investment costs. 
Our business partners operating in the 
IoT ecosystem can develop their solutions 
on the IoT Platform and reach Turkcell 
corporate customers through collaborations. 
Organizations are able to measure their 
energy consumption instantly with the energy 
efficiency scenario, one of the IoT scenarios. 
The platform translates these measurements 
into information to facilitate decision making, 
helping to bring significant savings in energy 
costs at the same time. In addition to the 
IoT Platform, we offer institutions solutions with the IoT based products we have developed 
in many areas such as Kopilot, Turkcell Filiz and Turkcell Enerjim. We support our customers’ 
strategic decision-making processes and increase their profitability and efficiency through 
meaningful analyses based on the dynamic and real data garnered from our big data 
services. Thanks to these services, we continue to create value for our customers in many 
sectors such as retail, e-commerce, shopping malls, transportation, finance, tourism, and fuel 
oil. In an organization’s journey towards digital transformation, with Turkcell digital business 
applications services we provide all end-to-end needs for the digitalization of business 
processes of institutions. 
In addition to our products and services, we have implemented more than 2,000 tailor made 
managed services and system integration projects, designed for the standard or specific 
needs of our customers, using our internal resources, products, processes and technologies Turkcell digital business

and public institutions 
alike, leveraging new 
technologies including

and the capabilities of our business partners 
within the ecosystem, who are specialized 
and experienced in their fields of activity. 
We continue to manage these projects. In 
addition to our value-added services, we 
implement digital transformation projects 
with vertical solutions that appeal to the 
needs of each sector. With our consultants 
who have expertise in relevant sectors, we 
analyze our customers in the focus sectors 
of healthcare, education, production, retail, 
finance, logistics, energy, tourism, SMEs and 
central and local administrations. We use a 
360-degree perspective to reveal the current 
situation with sector-based customer scores. 
Thus, instead of offering a general solution, 
we move towards deeper customer-centricity 
by positioning a solution set that considers 
their specific sectoral needs. 
We implement projects with high value 
proposition in the healthcare industry, where 
we achieved vertical expansion. Turkcell 
Digital Business Services is the market leader 
in the number of hospitals and beds covered 
in the city hospitals projects, which have 
become the main driver of success for our 
national healthcare sector which is one of the 
world’s leading healthcare service providers, 
especially in the region. As an integrator 
providing and operating all technological 
solutions required for city hospitals we are 
also the market leader in terms of both 
the number of beds and the number of 
hospitals in the public-private partnership 
market. We continue to play an important 
role in the digital transformation of hospitals, 
especially with our own Hospital Information 
Management System (HIMS) software, which 
we have developed exclusively with Turkcell 
Digital Business Services resources. The entire 
technology infrastructure from hardware 
to software, from system to operation 
is managed by Turkcell Group, for 7 city 
hospitals in Yozgat, Adana, Eskişehir, Elâzığ, 
Bursa, Başakşehir and Tekirdağ. Additionally, Turkcell had established technology 
infrastructure of 2 field hospitals, which 
became operational in a short period of 
time.
There are three main categories in 
our business partnership ecosystem 
that we manage end-to-end; our 
subcontractors, those we develop 
products/ solutions together with, and 
our sales partners. We focus on creating 
new sales opportunities for our products, 
services, and system integration projects 
through our sales partners. Last year, 
we launched the “Business Partnership 
Program” for approximately 150 sales 
partners in our ecosystem with different 
competencies. We continue to grow 
our ecosystem working with a win-
win approach. We recognize business 
partner achievements with our Partner 
Program which values success. In 2021, 
we kicked off developments to manage 
all business partners of our company 
Dijital İş Servisleri (Digital Business 
Services) through a single system with 
the Partner 360 model. Moreover, through 
our business partnerships with global 
vendors, we expand our solution portfolio 
to our customers in terms of technical 
competency and project diversity.With Paycell, our vision is to integrate technology 
and financial services in accordance with 
changing customer needs and habits, and 
to enable more customers to readily access 
financial services by offering fast and secure 
payment solutions. We aim to facilitate life by 
enabling access to financial services inclusively 
by everyone without having a bank account with 
Paycell, and make Paycell the largest payment 
platform of Turkey.
Factors including Turkey’s large and young 
population, high smart device penetration, nearly 
30 million unbanked potential users, high cash 
usage in shopping, rising e-commerce volumes 
and supportive regulatory developments, create 
a favorable environment for increasing the 
penetration of digital payment services in Turkey 
and support the growth potential of Paycell. The 
pandemic period also accelerated digitalization of 
payment habits.
We maintain our robust growth performance 
thanks to our services and solutions in various 
verticals including pay later, bill payment, e-wallet, 
money transfer, and payment facilitation over our 
application, which we position as a Super App. 
In Turkey’s fragmented techfin market, where 
competition is focused on providing solutions in 
various verticals, Paycell is differentiated by its 
strong positioning enabled by its wide portfolio 
of services, and its access to Turkcell’s deep 
technology expertise, large customer base and 
sales channel. As part of its growth strategy, 
Paycell focuses on increasing the number of 
merchants through Paycell Android POS, QR and 
Virtual POS, while making efforts to increase the 
number of users through its Super App vision. 
Together with our business partners, we have 
started offering a wide range of services on our 
Paycell Mobile application including insurance 
products as part of financial services and 
gaming-related services.With changing and evolving 
needs of daily life, many financial 
transactions are rapidly digitalizing 
in this new digital era. As Turkcell, 
we carry out our activities with 
an awareness of the potential in 
the techfin field, facilitating our 
customers’ financial transactions 
with our innovative services and 
solutions under the Paycell and 
Financell brands. Techfin services77 76ABOUT

With Financell, the leader of the non-
bank financial sector by the number of 
customers, we aim to contribute to the 
digital transformation of Turkey by becoming 
the financing partner of Digital Business 
Services in accordance with our Group’s 
growth strategy in the corporate segment. 
Under the Financell roof, we offer financing 
solutions to our consumer and corporate 
segment customers for their purchases of 
technological products and services. Thanks 
to our credit risk infrastructure and digital capabilities, we effectively manage credit 
risk by conducting a faster credit assessment. 
Meanwhile, with Turkcell Sigorta, we aim to 
become the largest Insurtech player in Turkey 
through end-to-end digital solutions. We offer 
innovative solutions for our customers’ risk 
management with fast and easy-to-access 
products. Accordingly, our customers have 
the opportunity to conveniently access and 
purchase insurance products via all Turkcell 
channels including call center, digital channels 
and stores. The fundamental working principles we adopt as Turkcell 
include inclusion, accessibility, availability, and the provision 
of transparent, consistent, and timely information to the 
stakeholders. We believe in simultaneous and open dialogue 
with our stakeholders, and work continuously to address all 
questions and requests from them quickly and accurately. 
In this respect, we map Turkcell’s material topics in our 
materiality matrix by taking on board our stakeholders’ 
valuable views.

(weforum.org) We identified the topics of the questionnaire, which we 
addressed to our key stakeholders, based on global trends 
and by incorporating the outputs of workshops with 
working groups, which include representatives from our 
key departments. We executed this process by taking the 
needs and priorities of our stakeholders into consideration. 
We conducted a stakeholder analysis by reaching out to our 
internal and external key stakeholder groups through the 
questionnaire to receive their opinions. We evaluated the 
material topics of Turkcell 2021, classified them into economic, 
environmental, governance, social, and digitalization topics. 
We created insight on the result of the stakeholder survey 
from the perspective of our strategic focus areas and core 
competencies. Following this stage, we integrated these 
topics with Turkcell’s sustainability material topics identified 
in previous reporting periods. As part of the external trend 
analysis, we analyzed SDGs, the World Economic Forum 
Global Risks Report 2021*, and the initiatives that guide the 
business world and mobile communication sector. In our 
external stakeholder analysis, we also took reports published 
by companies operating in the same sector into consideration 
in order to assess the perspective of society and the sector. 
We then received feedback from our senior management 
and established Turkcell’s material topics from an integrated 
value creation perspective. In order to identify the 
material topics that 
guide our management 
approach and 2021 
integrated annual report 
structure, we analyze 
global and sectoral 
trends together with 
our key internal and 
external stakeholders’

Strong corporate 
governance
Turkcell is the only Turkish company listed 
on both Borsa Istanbul (BIST) and the New 
York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This status in 
the capital markets enables us to adopt 
corporate governance principles in a 
permanent and optimal way within the 
internal organizational structure, which 
confirms our commitment in the long-term 
and sustainable value that our effective 
corporate processes create. Within Turkcell, 
everyone acts in accordance with sectoral 
regulations and competitive dynamics, and 
closely follows current developments. Cases 
that may occur within this scope are reported 
with transparency. Categorizing the current 
litigation management system according to 
ESG factors is among the goals of upcoming 
periods.Maintaining a strong corporate 
governance structure allows us to 
manage our business operations 
with high efficiency, and to show 
an exemplary corporate citizenship 
through ensuring compliance with the 
legal obligations which we are subject 
to. Moreover, we differentiate as a 
company, trusted by our stakeholders, 
thanks to compliance with domestic 
and international business regulations 
ensured by our Company’s compliance 
programs and our understanding of 
superior business ethics.

Compliance with international capital markets 
and effective corporate governance practicesAs a listed Company, we aim to provide long-
term benefits not only to our customers, but 
also to all our stakeholders with operating 
at the highest standards of corporate 
governance practices. In this context, we 
demonstrate exemplary corporate citizenship 
by improving our sustainability strategy and 
value creation model, and also by making 
it one of our primary goals to act in line 
with international standards in the fields of 
human rights, business ethics, anti-bribery and 
corruption, competition management, risk 
and crisis management.
In line with our aim of being 
a trusted company for all our 
stakeholders and being an 
exemplary corporate citizen, 
we oversee compliance with 
national and international Anti-
Bribery and Corruption (ABC) 
standards covering all our 
activities.The Board of Directors approved the Anti-
Bribery and Corruption Policy (ABC) in 2016 to 
establish the basis of our fight against bribery and 
corruption. This document is one of the first and 
major indications of how the Board of Directors 
is committed to the "zero tolerance" principle 
regarding bribery and corruption. Our ABC 
Policy is publicly available, and we expect the 
entire Turkcell ecosystem to act in line with this 
document. Within the framework drawn up by 
the ABC Policy, the ABC Program has been carried 
out with the establishment of the Corporate 
Governance & ABC Program Office (ABC Office) 
as of April 2018, which takes the necessary 
preventive measures to ensure compliance with 
these rules and provides risk-based trainings

Compliance Directorate with an autonomous 
structure reporting directly to the Board of 
Directors.
Executing the anti-bribery and corruption 
compliance program in 2021, our Corporate 
Governance & Capital Markets Compliance 
Directorate designed new training programs 
through the end-to-end revision of the 
existing ABC training programs. Within this 
perspective, the directorate has also arranged 
trainings specific to certain focus groups by 
maintaining its risk-based approach, was 
involved in processes related to mergers and 
acquisitions, strengthened coordination about 
domestic and international group companies’ 
compliance with the ABC policy, and 
conducted studies to disseminate this policy 
across the Turkcell ecosystem.
The Second Generation ABC Training, 
measuring the level of knowledge of 
attendants before and after the training and 
addressing many ethical dilemmas from actual 
daily professional life regarding bribery and 
corruption in a fictional flow, was assigned to 
all Turkcell group company employees across 
Turkey. 
In 2021, in order to strengthen the integration 
of our compliance programs in public tenders 
and to better oversee the potential bribery and 
corruption risks, capital markets and economic 
and trade sanctions risks in public tenders, 5 
different 1-hour trainings were provided for 334 
people.
Additionally, 1-hour Basic Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption Training was provided for 12 Turkcell 
Enerji employees as part of integration efforts 
following the acquisition of Boyut Enerji in 2021. 2 compliance coordination and cooperation 
workshops were held with domestic and 
international group company compliance 
contacts to which our CEO and Legal and 
Regulation Executive Vice President contributed 
with their opening speeches.
Additionally, in order to raise awareness of 
our ABC Program across our ecosystem and 
to ensure that our business is carried out in 
accordance with the ABC Policy, an anti-
bribery and anti-corruption training invitation 
was sent to our suppliers and business partners, 
and a 1-hour training was given to volunteering 
suppliers and business partners.  
Due to its specific position in the capital markets, 
Turkcell implements dual rule sets and good 
practices within the framework of both Turkish 
and U.S. capital markets, particularly on corporate 
governance structures, financial reporting and 
internal control processes. Among Turkcell’s 
prominent corporate processes implemented 
as part of those requirements, the following 
can be named: Turkcell Board of Directors and 
its committees’ structure, operating rules and 
independence of its members; the effective 
internal control environment regarding the 
financial reporting processes based on reporting 
and disclosure obligations before the Capital 
Markets Board (CMB), U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC), BIST and NYSE; the 
ethical rules applicable to the company’s senior 
management as well as finance executives in 
accordance with SEC; and the blackout period 
and the quiet period for the trading of shares. 
Practices based on the Public Companies 
Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act, 
also known as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act and U.S. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which aim 
to improve the control mechanisms of companies’ 
financial reporting while supporting effective 
corporate management, particularly stand out 
as part of Turkcell’s short- and long-term and 
sustainable corporate DNA.

and revised when necessary through 
coordination of Corporate Governance & Capital 
Markets Compliance Directorate as part of the 
Turkcell Sanctions Compliance Program adopted 
by the Board of Directors, tracks compliance with Within this context;Since 2019, Turkcell has adopted 
specific internal rules applying to 
potential conflicts of interest at the 
level of Board of Directors, and, as of

evaluation process involving the 
directors.Prominent Corporate Governance Practices 
at the Level of Board of Directors
As per the legislation binding our company, 
the code of conduct applying to our 
Board Members who might be considered 
public officials has been established and 
implemented by our Board of Directors. 
Furthermore, the annual performance 
evaluation of our Board of Directors based 
on certain criteria was discussed as part of 
the improvement of corporate governance 
across our Company, and it is aimed that the 
improvement areas identified as a result of 
the evaluation process will be the basis for 
further corporate governance practices. 
Within this framework, the first Board of 
Directors performance evaluation process 
was completed within December, 2021 in 
line with the methodology which Corporate 
Governance & Capital Markets Compliance 
Directorate designed and submitted to the 
Corporate Governance Committee and the 
committee later proposed this performance 
evaluation process to the Board of Directors. 
The details of the performance evaluation 
process is as follows: the framework of economic and trade sanctions 
rules we are bound by, in particular the OFAC 
(Office of Foreign Assets Control) at the level of 
all directors across our Company and ensures 
that such compliance is reported.

in order to carry out our obligations to comply 
with capital markets regulations and corporate 
governance practices that we are subject 
to under an autonomous structure that has 
direct access to the Board of Directors, SOX 
Coordination and Compliance Unit has been 
established within the ABC Office as of January 
2019. The SOX Coordination and Compliance 
Unit has been continuing its operations under 
the name of SOX Compliance and Governance Unit since January 1, 2021. The SOX Compliance 
and Governance Unit, along with monitoring 
the regulations of SEC and Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board, supports 
corporate transparency and contributes to 
reliable information disclosure to the public by 
incorporating good practices within our Company.

Department under the title of SOX 404 practices 
that constitute an integral part of our employees’ 
way of doing business. As part of SOX 404 
related activities, internal company bulletins and 
annotations on 24 subjects were published in 
2021.

It is critical to ensure and maintain 
competition effectively across 
all markets in which Turkcell and 
Turkcell Group Companies operate. 
Accordingly, Turkcell is committed 
to carrying out all business and 
operations in accordance with 
the competition legislation and 
regulations. Competition management
One of the main objectives of competition 
law is to prevent dominant players in the 
market to abuse their power by establishing 
agreements, decisions and practices, which 
avoids, distorts or restricts fair competition. 
Moreover, the competition law controls 
merger and acquisition transactions to 
preserve competition in the markets, and 
makes necessary regulations and conducts 
supervision to protect competition. In this 
context, certain processes are followed 
within Turkcell, including but not limited to the 
following:
The guidelines, briefings and trainings prepared as part of the competition compliance process are 
examined by all employees. 
In line with our general principles, any verbal or written agreements and communications with 
competitors on the following issues are avoided; price determination, sharing of customer/ region, 
sharing of trade channels, restriction of supply amount or initiating a boycott, and collusion in 
tenders.
Sensitive information is not shared among competitors.
Causing difficulties for the activities of competing companies, prevention of new entrance to the 
market, high sales prices and sales prices below cost are avoided.
Resale prices of third parties that resell Turkcell products and services are not interfered in by 
Turkcell. Recommended sales price notification rules are precisely followed. 
Turkcell and Turkcell Group companies act in all their 
markets of operation in accordance with competition 
rules under the Turkish Commercial Code, the Law on the 
Protection of Competition, the Electronic Communications 
Law and secondary legislations.
We disclose information on critical cases that Turkcell is 
a party to, as part of our disclosures to the BIST, SEC and 
other related authorities in compliance with CMB and 
IFRS standards. In this context, critical cases arising from 
competition law are also included in those reports. In 2021, 
there is no preliminary research initiated, or investigation 
filed against our Company before the Competition Authority 
for alleged violation of competition regulations under the 
Law on the Protection of Competition.
The business relations of Turkcell are governed 
through the resolutions of the Board of Directors, 
who represents the Company’s shareholders and 
is responsible to them. The Board of Directors is 
formed by 9 directors with general management 
responsibility for Turkcell's operations as per Turkcell's

As Turkcell, we closely follow up on those trends, as well 
as issues such as e-mobility and climate change, and 
shape our business model and strategy to accurately 
address and manage these issues. As we have to date, 
so too in the future do we aim to introduce our country 
and our people with the latest technologies through our 
domestic and national digital services developed by our 
engineers and software developers. We further aim to 
contribute to the digital transformation of our country 
and create value for all our stakeholders with our 
innovative and value-added solutions. While evaluating 
and analyzing such global trends, we make use of 
publicly available sources such as industry reports 
and opinions, as well as the reports of international 
organizations. This section includes insights into the 
prominent trends and Turkcell’s approach to managing 
them.Trends and 
their impacts
2021 has been a turning 
point for the industry 
in which we operate. It 
highlighted the exciting 
and fundamental 
trends of recent years 
such as technological 
developments, changing 
economic structures and 
evolving social needs.
Mobile communication 
technology is usually 
updated with a new 
generation every 10 
years, but now it is 
advancing at a faster 
rate.Following the IMT Authorization in 2015, in order to address 
the expectations of our customers with respect to high 
speed, we made 4.5G technology available in our country 
in 2016. As Turkcell, we are proud to be named one of 
the world's top 3 operators providing the highest speed 
in 4.5G technology according to a report by the Global 
Mobile Suppliers Association (GSA) released in August 2021. 
Additionally, we prepare for the 5G technology whose 
standards are currently being defined and for download 
speeds which are expected to reach Gbits per second. This 
next generation technology is expected to exponentially 
grow the importance of technologies like autonomous 
vehicles, virtual reality, augmented reality, online healthcare 
and education services, remote work and Internet of 
Things (IoT) in our lives. Additionally, with the development 
of standards and use cases, 5G technology is expected to 
bring USD 2.2 trillion to global economy from 2024 to 2034, 
and the number of global 5G connections is foreseen to 
reach 1.8 billion by 2025.*
The 5G technology is expected to lead to disruptions 
in many industries including healthcare, automotive, 
entertainment and service as well as telecommunication. 
As a software-based technology, which will become 
central to several sectors, new generation 5G technology 
will drive strategic change in the way countries and 
corporations view communication technologies.5G transition
How do we manage?
Having adapted our human-oriented 
corporate mindset in the field of 5G 
as we did in all-other technology 
developments, we experience this new 
technology over 5G test networks 
installed in certain cities through use of 
temporary 5G test frequencies allocated 
from the Information and Communication 
Technologies Authority. In those test 
areas, we analyze the transition of our 
4.5G network to 5G, observe 5G network 
performance and examine 5G network 
products. Moreover, we continue to contribute 
to the development of local 5G 
infrastructure with the “End-to-
End Domestic and National 5G 
Communication Network” Project that 
we signed as a stakeholder in 2017, 
and which is carried out within the 
scope of Communication Technologies 
Cluster (HTK) activities and supported 
by TÜBİTAK. As part of the Tech-Driven 
Industry Initiative (HAMLE Project) 
supported by the TÜBİTAK, we continue 
our support for local producers. 
In addition, we support product

development efforts of some local producers 
which are not covered by official projects.
With our goal of building a domestic and 
national 5G digital ecosystem, we not only 
experience this technology through our 5G 
test networks but also are glad to lead 5G 
development efforts across the country 
by enabling the implementation of 5G use 
cases as part of industry business models 
in different verticals. We have taken various 
important steps in using the 5G technology 
including drone communication, pre-hospital 
medical intervention on ambulance in the 
healthcare industry, first live TV broadcast 
over 5G and VR experience in sports 
competitions. Using our 5G test networks, 
we continue to lead the establishment of 
a domestic and national 5G digital service 
ecosystem through new projects in this field.
With our 5G R&D team created in 2017, we 
take part in a wide range of national and 
international projects by developing projects 
with our own resources in various areas. We 
have created a wide ecosystem through 
collaborations with regulatory bodies, 
standardization organizations, universities 
and research institutions, and by working 
closely with many local or foreign institutions 
and organizations, including companies from 
various sectors. 
 
We participated in the "AI/ML in 5G 
Challenge" organized by the ITU (International 
Telecommunication Union) as part of its "AI 
for Good" focus with our use case "Radio 
Link Failure Prediction". This use case aims 
to predict radio link failures due to weather 
conditions or temporary/permanent physical 
obstacles and take necessary actions with 
proactive approaches.
As a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult for mobile 
operators to cope with rapid fluctuations in data volumes. 
While leading to difficulties for the telecommunications 
industry in terms of technical infrastructure requirements, big 
data also offers to turn this challenge into an opportunity 
with big data analytics applications. This opportunity needs to 
be used by not only the technical people but also the entire 
organization. It also renders it important for all organizations 
to devise decision mechanisms through data-driven analysis. 
While this data size requires anyone also without software 
experience to work with data, it also drives us towards a 
structure where anybody can perform data analysis and 
analytics with low-code platforms. Big data
As Turkcell, we provide our corporate 
customers the opportunity to 
understand the shopping habits of 
potential customers and reach them 
with our big data analytics services. 
Big data also enables us to interpret 
changes in the shopping habits of 
existing customers, and accordingly to 
offer the most appropriate solutions. Our big data analytics consultants work to 
determine the characteristics of our existing 
and new customers with customer profiling 
studies. We also prioritize studies to increase 
the loyalty of existing customers. With big 
data, which we obtained through customer 
profiling activities, we can understand the 
needs of our existing, new and old customers, 
and increase our revenue generation 
potential with new value proposals. We are 
aware of the need to interpret the correct 
customer data in order to reach the target 
audience and make the right investments, 
and we continue growing our business 
by doing so with big data. In an era of 
transparent competition, it is critical to track 
customer satisfaction instantly and act on 
it. Accordingly, we track experiences of our 
customers closely and try to drive maximum 
satisfaction.
In today's 
telecommunications 
world, a large amount 
of data production 
takes place through 
social media networks, 
connected devices, 
customer behavior, 
government service 
portals, call data records, 
billing information and 
similar sources.

The criticality of services offered by telecommunication 
operators rises with the rapidly growing importance of 
non-spatial processes due to the pandemic, increase in the 
number of connected devices together with developing 
technologies, and digitalization of many daily habits. 
The number of people with access to internet through 
mobile applications has reached 4 billion, proving that the 
telecom sector is one of the most effective channels for 
digital services to reach people. The contribution of mobile 
technology and services, making up approximately 5% of 
world GDP in 2020, to economic growth is expected to 
increase as a consequence of the changes experienced. 
Facilitating people's access to information and growing 
in importance globally, the telecommunication industry 
stands out as one of the most critical industries to eliminate 
inequalities and enable access to information, services and 
financial services. In this context, the telecommunication 
industry can bring social equality through digital solutions that 
cover a broad range of social groups and accelerate global 
development with smart applications.
Using our strong analytical competencies, we develop high 
quality innovative products, services and projects, and offer 
services in many areas from education to finance. 
We continue our rapid improvement in the mobile payment 
field with our Paycell application, which has been positioned 
as a new generation super app, with over 14 million 
downloads to date. Within the scope of our digital services, 
we offer solutions that meet the needs of our customers 
with our products including TV+, fizy, BiP and lifebox. We 
support the digitalization journey of institutions by offering 
digital business services. In areas where the infrastructure is 
insufficient to deliver fiber internet, we can provide fast and 
secure internet access for everyone via our Superbox product 
offering fiber speed internet without the need of a cable 
connection. With the Whiz Kids project, we bring special, 
talented students together with technology and science. With 
our My Dream Companion project, we work to provide equal 
access to information by the visually impaired.By simplifying and 
accelerating access 
to information, mobile 
communication 
technologies provide 
a basis for digital 
transformation process 
for both individuals and 
organizations. 
How do we manage?Digital transformation and 
inclusion
As Turkcell, since our 
establishment, we have 
placed technology’s 
power to provide 
equal opportunities 
at the center of all 
our activities, having 
implemented projects 
that aim to ensure 
equal opportunities in 
information access for 
all. In addition to a number of natural disasters 
taking place, changes in climate policies, 
technology, consumer preferences and 
financial market expectations have recently 
been creating huge fluctuations in commodity 
prices and causing a rise in costs. Accordingly, 
spending on research and development (R&D) 
in new and alternative technologies are also 
increasing. 
In order for the business world and companies 
to manage these risks effectively, they need 
to focus on implementing circular economy, 
renewable energy and pro-recycling strategies 
which will achieve net zero emissions rapidly. 
As per the goals of the Paris Agreement, 73 
countries, including the EU members, committed 
to become carbon-neutral by 2050, and the 
number of committing countries is increasing. 
Turkey also signed the Paris Agreement in 
2021, revealed its 2053 goal and joined other 
countries that declared a commitment. 
The European Commission formed the new 
European Green Digital Coalition in March 2021 
to encourage digitalization which supports 
carbon neutrality. Half of 26 founding members 
who signed the declaration were from the 
mobile technologies industry.Climate change
5 out of 10 risks that are most 
potentially damaging include 
environmental and climate change 
risks according to the World 
Economic Forum (WEF) 2021 Global 
Risk Report prepared in the face of 
problems related to wildfires and 
floods which get more frequent 
across the globe and more 
difficult to bring under control, 
and destruction of biodiversity. 
These risks are defined as climate 
action failure, biodiversity loss, 
natural resource crises, human 
environmental damage and extreme 
weather.

In our energy-focused activities, we convert 
and invest in environmentally friendly green 
energy sources within the framework 
of Sustainable Development Goals. As a 
company consuming and aiming to generate 
100% renewable energy in accordance 
with the Turkcell Sustainability Strategy we 
announced in 2020, we work to achieve 
our goal of going carbon-neutral by 2050. 
Accordingly, we acquired Izmir Karadağ 
Wind Power Plant in 2021, which reinforces 
our vision of being a company not only 
consuming renewable energy but also 
generating it.
You can access more information on Turkcell’s efforts regarding the 
Climate Change trend in the Natural Capital Section of the report.How do we manage?
Climate change risks have a direct 
impact on Turkcell’s business 
operations. As Turkcell, we conduct 
field risk analyses during the 
installation of base stations. We 
take measures against the risks of 
extreme weather events and natural 
disasters caused by climate change, 
and plan for the transfer of data 
centers to locations with cold climates, 
foreseeing a rise in average air 
temperatures in the long term. 
SDG 7.2, 13.b
The production is planned to start in late 2022. Togg 
works to finalize cooperation with entities as required 
for the e-mobility ecosystem to be created around 
the electric car which it defines as a "smart car". By 
contributing to this ecosystem with the solutions we 
develop and our technological competences, we aim 
to create synergies that will add value to Turkcell.
We keep the technological infrastructure ready 
both as software and hardware for organizations 
which will require it in the future in connection 
with e-mobility solutions, with our local production 
approach and data centers.
We provide municipalities and airline companies 
with meaningful insight aimed at transportation 
planning. Through transportation matrices we 
provide to municipalities, we contribute to accurate 
planning, enabling people to use public transportation 
more conveniently. In addition, we help cut carbon 
emissions by reducing traffic density. The data we 
make available to airway companies help them 
analyze masses travelling between cities and see 
seasonal impacts. We help achieve energy savings 
through efficient transportation planning.How do we manage?
Our e-mobility solutions, 
offered as part of digital 
business services within 
Turkcell, incorporate the most 
advanced vehicle and fleet 
technologies for improving the 
safety of vehicles as well as 
employees. The construction 
of the Bursa factory of Togg, 
which is developed by Turkey’s 
Automobile Joint Venture 
Group where Turkcell has 23% 
shareholding, continues as 
planned. It is foreseen that the concept of e-mobility will trigger a 
disruption not only in automotive and transportation industry 
but also in technology. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 
pandemic, e-mobility is expected to contribute to economic 
recovery and create opportunities for digital technologies, as 
well as new employment.
Accelerated development of e-mobility and technology 
trends has brought our country to the edge of a new era. 
Focusing on the production of next generation technologies, 
the transportation industry works to devise the flexible and 
innovative solutions needed. The Togg project, Turkey’s first 
domestic car to be designed as an electric vehicle, marks 
an important and powerful initiative in the e-mobility sector. 
Turkey's ability to leverage its own resources in electric car 
competition as part of its e-mobility efforts will provide a 
great advantage, contributing to the development of the 
country on the electric car market. E-mobility
The concept of e-mobility 
is developing on a daily 
basis with key trends such 
as autonomous driving 
technologies, connectivity, 
electrification and 
carpooling. The idea has 
gained momentum and 
become widespread 
that the developments in 
e-mobility field will affect 
different aspects ranging 
from the cities we live 
to the roads we use as 
well as the companies 
operating in this area.

Moreover, ensuring effective and competitive market 
dynamics and helping customers with the desired level 
of digital experience requires the active participation of 
sector players, NGOs and regulatory authorities. 
In order to unlock the potential of electronic 
communication technologies and develop innovative 
services meeting customer needs, it is fundamental that 
sectoral regulations support the development of the digital 
economy, and ensure fair competition and investment 
environment.Regulatory developments and sector 
regulations
We position our 
comprehensive legal 
services requiring 
national and international 
compliance at the center 
of our operations and 
assess the compliance of 
all activities carried out 
across Turkcell. As Turkcell, 
we create a permanent 
footprint in the global 
market and continue our 
expansion by managing 
disputes effectively and 
taking preventive legal 
actions, while building 
business strategies on a 
solid legal foundation. 
The digitalization of our 
processes helps us add 
value to our leadership 
journey and the reputation 
of Turkcell and our Group 
companies. We take public institutions and regulatory authorities as 
an essential part of our ecosystem, and, with a focus 
on the continuity of the sustainable ecosystem and 
consumer welfare, contribute to all legislative efforts 
relating to our industry in a direct or indirect way as an 
active stakeholder of each and every stage. We are 
aware that regulatory developments have the potential 
to directly impact our business model and strategies. 
We conduct our activities in accordance with our goal 
of creating value for our country and our industry by 
working in cooperation with regulatory authorities and 
relevant stakeholders. 
Furthermore, we work in both national and international 
arenas in connection with the legal dimension of 
evolving technologies such as AI, blockchain, space 
technologies, cybersecurity, smart cities, creating value in 
this area for both our company and country. As a factor of freedom of 
communication, which is 
defined as a constitutional 
right, and as one of the 
most critical sectors in 
our country, the electronic 
communications industry 
is closely monitored 
and controlled through 
industry-specific 
activities, regulations and 
legislations. 
How do we manage?
With risks related to climate crisis rising, it is 
inevitable that sustainable debt instruments 
become widespread and unavoidable for 
banks to incorporate more compelling criteria 
for the sustainability of the projects they 
finance. The ESG investments are expected 
to increase on a global scale in the future. 
Sustainable financing resources are critical 
for the investments in the scope of long-term 
plans with the "European Green Deal" which 
promotes these investments, and for the 
financing of projects to be realized. Unlike conventional financing, 
sustainable financing refers to 
financing facilities where sources 
of funds are used based on various 
environmental, social or governance 
criteria. The current stage of climate 
crisis pushed investors to put more 
emphasis on non-financial risk factors, 
resulting in increased amount of 
reporting on these factors. Accordingly, 
companies have shifted to adapt their 
business strategies and corporate 
financing and investment activities to 
the Sustainable Development Goals 
promoted by the United Nations 
Global Compact. 
Therefore, we are working towards our target of increasing 
our sustainability linked funding which we already secured 
as part of "Sustainability-Indexed Loan" and "Green Loan" 
transactions launched in 2019 and 2020, respectively. 
Accordingly, we increased the amount of 3-year term 
Sustainability-Indexed loan from EUR 50 million to EUR 70 
million which Turkcell Iletişim borrowed from BNP Paribas in 
2019 and  we extended its term to December 2026. We aim 
to improve access to Sustainability-based financing resources 
for all of our companies as Turkcell Group, and carry out 
larger number of projects in this scope. Thus, we channel our 
investments to the achievement of the SDGs. Meanwhile, we 
continue our activities as one of the founding members of 
the UNGC CFO Taskforce, which aims to create a market for 
investments towards the SDGs.Sustainable financing 
activities
How do we manage?
Focusing on sustainable 
financing options, we 
diversify our financing 
instruments, promote 
our sustainability efforts, 
and keep looking for 
access to financing on 
more advantageous 
conditions.

In 2021, fintech and payment industry became interested in a 
novel product. Consumers welcomed this payment method 
allowing them to "buy now, pay later". Capgemini's "World 
Payment Report 2021" shows that Generation Z has replaced 
their credit card use with "buy now, pay later" method. A 
survey in this report demonstrates that 75% of consumers 
below 30 years of age use their credit cards less than 20 
times a year while they are open to possibilities involving "buy 
now, pay later" method. 
Smartphones, which are the primary means to internet access 
for people, play a facilitating role for many technologies and 
services, including fintech. Fintech and mobile services have 
the potential to provide access to financial resources and 
services for the unbanked population. 
With the Draft for the "Regulation on Principles of Activities 
for Digital Banks and Service Model Banking", which was 
published in August 2021, the legal regulations related to 
Digital Banks are starting to be implemented. Announced in 
the Official Gazette No. 31704 of 29.12.2021, the "Regulation 
on the Operation Principles of Digital Banks and Service 
Model Banking" identified the legislation to come into force on 
01.01.2022.The accelerated 
digitalization, wider 
use of cryptocurrency 
and blockchain and the 
rising global smartphone 
penetration provide a 
convenient environment 
for the development of 
financial technologies 
(fintech). In the first 
half of 2021, fintech 
investments reached USD 
98 billion.The development of 
fintech applications
In the Turkcell ecosystem, 
fintech is referred to as 
techfin in terms of our 
focus on technology, 
and techfin activities are 
carried out through our 
three subsidiaries; Paycell, 
Financell and Turkcell 
Sigorta. Leveraging 
our experience of over 
a quarter century, our 
superior digital services 
and advanced analytical 
capabilities, we closely 
follow the innovations 
in the techfin field and

One of the top items on 
the agenda of decision-
making mechanisms 
of institutions and 
organizations, the AI 
technology is reshaping 
company strategies as 
a technology tackling 
complex tasks and 
covering applications 
and software. Many companies make significant investments in data 
science teams to benefit from the opportunities and values 
offered by AI. The fact that institutions which incorporate 
machine learning and cognitive interactions into their 
traditional business processes and application software can 
improve their user experience substantially and increase their 
productivity demonstrates the value of AI. Artificial intelligence 
As Turkcell, we work in 
compliance with our 
company's policies, 
procedures and internal 
controls created on the 
basis of international 
standards and the 
regulations which we are 
subject to. Additionally, 
we comply with our 
AI principles consisting 
of "focus on people 
and environment, 
transparency, 
professional 
responsibility, data 
privacy, security, 
justice, and sharing 
and cooperation for a 
better future" clauses we 
announced in January 
2020.We give priority to compliance with these seven principles in 
AI efforts, which is expected to be the focus of technological 
developments. With this pioneering step, we joined other 
global players who work to devise solutions to ethical 
problems that could arise from the use of AI. In our country, 
we played a leading role at a turning point for artificial 
intelligence, which will be the most popular technological 
concept over the next decade and impact the global 
leadership claim of countries. Our AI principles guarantee that 
AI is for people and people-oriented and this technology will 
be used responsibly without damage to human value.
In our offers and services provided through our AI technology, 
we interpret the big data and create tailor-made offers 
through our analytic capabilities. Using machine learning 
techniques in areas of traffic density, capacity management 
and anomaly detection in our network, we contribute to 
the efficiency of our infrastructure. We offer our artificial 
intelligence solutions to institutions and organizations through 
our Digital Business Services company.
As Turkcell AI team, we rely on AI image processing in 
recruitment of talent for Turkcell without requiring any 
printed material or spending days in front of the screen to 
process the applications of 60 to 70 thousand candidates.

Our strategic goals are frequently revised within the knowledge of the top 
management and in accordance with the business plans as AI activities 
are directly connected to the technology function. We work in a rapidly 
changing technological ecosystem, and regulations regarding AI could emerge 
very quickly with every passing day in every industry from healthcare to 
security, finance to education. Our legal and regulatory team has long been 
collaborating with global organizations to eliminate concerns over artificial 
intelligence, and also to increase its positive impact. As Turkcell, we play 
an active role at international platforms where responsible and ethical use 
and future of AI are discussed. In this context, we contribute to the following 
activities:
Children's rights and AI activities,
Activities regarding responsible use of face recognition systems,
Standardization activities carried out across the IEEE and aiming to eliminate 
potential ethical problems and concerns to arise from AI,
Data governance activities across the IEEE,
AI and Healthcare activities carried out across the ITU,
International activities regarding responsible and ethical use of AI technology in 
smart cities. 
Acting responsibly as per the Law on the 
Protection of Personal Data, Turkcell carries 
out activities without violating the principles 
it announced and by making AI available 
for people to unleash and develop human 
potential.We do video interviews with candidates and evaluate 
these videos with AI without any human effort. Giving 
candidates the opportunity to attend their interview 
from wherever they are, and thus avoiding adverse 
effects of transportation on the environment, we also 
save the energy spent for evaluating applications.
In our country, limited access to fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) 
or fiber-to-the building (FTTB) , which may best meet these 
needs, results in unmet demand of users and hinders the 
digital transformation of our country. The growing need 
for broadband connection and low penetration of fiber 
infrastructure in our country increase the importance of 
investments in this area. The COVID-19 pandemic 
and the aftermath 
underlined the 
importance of high-
quality and high-speed 
broadband connection. 
Demand for a strong 
internet service has 
greatly increased due to 
various factors including 
online education 
and remote working 
becoming widespread 
and permanent which 
led to a change in 
user behavior, and an 
increase in the number 
of devices concurrently 
connected to the internet 
at homes. 
As Turkcell, we 
accelerated our 
fiber infrastructure 
investments in 2021. 
While we added 234 
thousand homepasses 
in 2020, we brought the 
fiber quality of Turkcell 
to 653 thousand more 
households in 2021.Fiber infrastructure
How do we manage?
With the contribution of these investments, we added 
a net of 223 thousand fiber subscribers in 2021. In the 
upcoming periods, we will maintain our focus on fiber 
infrastructure investments considering the favorable 
market conditions. In addition, we believe that our fiber 
investments will greatly contribute to the process of 
transition to 5G.113 112 2VALUE CREATING

responsible for assessing risks and reporting 
risk prevention activities to the Early Detection 
of Risks Committee, as well as coordinating 
the risk prevention activities within Turkcell 
and its group companies through the 
Corporate Risk Management methodology. 
The Turkcell Enterprise Risk Management 
team aims for an approach whereby the

with fundamental management processes. 
Accordingly, an Enterprise Risk Management 
framework was identified as per the COSO 
ERM framework and ISO 31000 standards. 
Corporate Risk Management classifies risks 
of Turkcell Group companies and holds their 
records on "Risk Universe" to manage them. 
This allows for each company to have their 
own risk library and manage their risks in a 
more efficient and focused manner.
The Turkcell Group Business Continuity 
Management System has been structured 
and certified in a manner ensuring the Effective risk and crisis 
management
Corporate risk and business 
continuity management Effective risk and crisis management, a priority for 
both our Company and our stakeholders, enables 
the management of risks that may impact the 
achievement of Company targets determined in line 
with our strategies, within the scope of the Corporate 
Risk Management (CRM) system.
Considering the key risk indicators and making use 
of the technology-based opportunities, we practice 
effective risk management processes in a way that 
takes the global trends and developments within our 
sector into consideration. 
Since the end of the financial year 
of 2012, the “Early Detection of Risks 
Committee” has been in operation 
to perform activities in a manner 
affiliated with the Board of Directors 
within the scope of article 378 of 
the Turkish Commercial Code and 
the Communiqué on Corporate 
Governance of the Capital Markets 
Board. The Early Detection of Risks 
Committee supports the Board of 
Directors by carrying out activities 
to early detect of risks that may 
jeopardize the existence, development 
and continuity of the Company, take 
necessary measures for identified risks 
and manage risks. The Committee 
reports to the Board of Directors once 
every 2 months and these reports are 
shared with the independent audit 
company. SDG 16.6
continuity of our voice, messaging, 
internet, server services, data centers 
and public security services as per the 
international ISO 22301, Societal Security - 
Business Continuity Management Systems 
standard. As of 2021, the scope of the ISO 
22301 business continuity management 
system has been expanded to include 
the critical products and services of 
our DSS companies such as BiP İletişim, 
Lifecell Bulut and Turktell Bilişim. Regular 
drills are conducted to test our business 
continuity plans, drafted in consideration of 
customer expectations, corporate policies 
and legal obligations, so as to guarantee 
their sustained operation in case of 
emergencies or disasters.
Our geographically dispersed technical 
infrastructure, extensive coverage, solution 
partner network, mobile network, mobile 
base stations, additional capacity, emergency center and past experiences 
enable us to minimize risks as much as 
possible. Additionally, the experience of our 
Group companies in customer services, 
our high-speed fiber-optic infrastructure, 
data storage services and our experienced 
software development teams allow us 
to effectively manage any disasters from 
another center, thereby ensuring the 
continuity of our activities.
Turkcell’s Crisis Management Plan covers 
seven major events; operational disruptions, 
natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, etc.), 
cyber-attacks, terrorism, fire, pandemic 
and epidemic and toxic events. In order to 
increase the effectiveness of the Turkcell 
Crisis Management Plan, regular drills are 
conducted, and trainings and awareness 
activities are held with the participation 
of Crisis Management Teams and related 
groups.115 114 2VALUE CREATING

Data security risk
Macroeconomic risksCyber security riskInformation 
security risks
Financial 
risksThis includes the risks of theft, loss, leakage, deliberate or accidental disclosure, 
misregistration, alteration, deletion, destruction and inaccessibility of any information 
stored both in physical and/or in electronic media via authorized/unauthorized 
access from within or outside of the organization. In response to risks associated 
with data security, Turkcell takes the necessary technical and administrative 
measures. 
This includes the risk of worsening expectations and/or the current situation due to 
economic and political uncertainties. Turkcell already diversifies its financing sources 
and keeps different resources and necessary agreements ready, for events of 
possible sanctions and regional inability to access certain resources.This involves the risk of destruction of information systems and of damage to 
systems due to the malicious use of Turkcell’s internal and external computer and 
network systems.  In this context, Turkcell manages vulnerabilities by implementing 
end-to-end security controls and tests. The Security Operations Center monitors 
threats 24/7 and performs cyber-attack monitoring and defense.
Investment risks and risk of adaptation to technological 
developmentsStrategic 
risks
These are the risks that can affect the Company’s position, reputation and image 
in the market and the sector in the short, medium, or long term. These risks can 
also be induced from lack of investment in innovation, new businesses within the 
sector and other areas and/or missing opportunities due to not being able to get 
the expected return on investment. In this context, sectoral, local and global trends 
and competitor activities in new business lines are closely monitored and necessary 
actions are taken. Technological developments are followed through collaborations 
with important international sectoral organizations such as GSMA, as well as through 
competent R&D studies and projects at national and international levels.Currency, interest and inflation risk
Liquidity, financing risks
Cash generation and collection risksThis includes the risk of increasing costs and decreasing revenue due to fluctuations 
in inflation, and interest rate and exchange rates. In this context, market dynamics 
are closely monitored, and appropriate financial instruments are selected and 
implemented to minimize exchange rate risk.
This involves the risk of disruptions to cash flow and inability to fulfill the obligations 
due to inaccessibility of financing resources utilized or intended to be utilized, 
or inability to pay-back loans. Turkcell’s forward-looking cash projection is 
systematically monitored with the principles of effective balance sheet and liquidity 
management. 
This involves the risk of disruptions to cash flow due to the inability to collect existing 
receivables on time. In periods when collection risk increases for certain reasons 
(economic crisis, pandemic, war, etc.), collection balances and trends, as well as cash 
flow are monitored and reported to senior management on a daily basis.

Risks regarding compliance
Lawsuits and legal conflict risksLegal 
risks
Business 
continuity risksThis involves the risk of encountering administrative sanctions as a result of failure 
to comply with the applicable regulations. Turkcell aims to monitor and prevent 
any possibility of non-compliance by closely following developing and changing 
regulations with a pro-active management approach. Within this context, business 
teams are provided with briefings and information with respect to changes in 
legislations as well as new regulations which are monitored by senior management 
through Personal Data Steering Committee, Compliance Committee, Sub-compliance 
Committee and Information Systems Compliance Committee; and relevant 
compliance activities are carried out in this respect. Moreover, various measures are 
taken via digitalized tools such as internal audit and automated control systems, 
working continuously, in order to prevent the occurrence of any breach and 
imposition of any administrative sanctions.
These are the risks which the Company may encounter as a result of events 
including operational interruptions, natural disasters, terrorism, etc.  Crisis, business 
and service continuity plans within the Company have been prepared meticulously.  
In order to evaluate its effectiveness and identify potential areas for improvement, 
plans are reviewed periodically, and regular drills are carried out annually.  The risks 
that could be related to business continuity and connected to Marmara Earthquake 
and Climate Change are defined, evaluated and necessary actions are taken in 
coordination with the Corporate Risk Management in a manner that encompasses 
all functions of our Company. Corporate Risk and Business Continuity management 
enables increasing awareness around risk-based management and adopting a 
manner of risk management based on scenarios through a lens of effective and 
dynamic risk management.This includes the risk of encountering sanctions against Turkcell due to the filing of a 
lawsuit related to the area of responsibility. Legal activities are carried out regarding 
those conflicts that may arise against Turkcell regarding its operations/contracts/
projects.
Environmental, sustainability and ecological risksOperational 
risks
Issues that may arise from climate change (such as temperature changes, increase 
in energy consumption, increase in energy prices, insufficient waste management, 
lack of protection of water resources, etc.) and risks related to environmental 
factors that may affect human health and biological diversity are included in this risk 
category. In this context, as Turkey’s first ISO 50001 certified mobile operator, Turkcell 
tracks its energy consumption and makes extensive renewable energy investments 
through its subsidiaries. As an ISO 14064 (International Greenhouse Gas Calculation 
and Verification Standard) certified mobile operator, Turkcell calculates and verifies 
its greenhouse gas emissions through an independent organization. Through its CDP 
Climate Change reporting, Turkcell regularly shares information with stakeholders on 
its approach to climate change performance and its risks and opportunities posed 
by climate change. As a company that consumes and produces 100% renewable 
energy, Turkcell continues to work and invest around its goal to become carbon-
neutral by 2050. Additionally, Turkcell is a zero-waste certificated company with 
zero-waste recycling.

The risks induced by climate change directly affect Turkcell's business operations. 
Precautions are taken in case of extreme weather conditions and natural disaster 
risks and practices are being implemented foreseeing the long-term increase in 
average temperatures. The effects and results of risks created by climate change 
are monitored within the framework of Corporate Risk Management.
As Turkcell, we conduct field risk analyses during the installation of base stations. We 
take measures against the risks of extreme weather events and natural disasters 
caused by climate change, and plan for the transfer of data centers to locations with 
cold climates, foreseeing a rise in average temperatures in the long term. Turkcell’s 
mobile base stations can be seen as examples of our agile and creative solutions 
which are mandatory in such circumstances of climate change. Mobile base stations 
that have solar panels on top of the vehicles are located to serve in places where 
there is a loss of service or a need for additional capacity. Furthermore, portable 
solar fields are parts of our agile energy solutions in the face of climate change. In 
addition, some base stations of Turkcell are integrated with solar panels so that they 
switch to solar energy in case of a network outage. This allows Turkcell's control 
mechanisms to predict all risks in order to prevent interruptions in communication 
making Turkcell one of the exemplary companies around the globe.
Climate crisis
The increase in energy demand and limitations of energy resources in 2021 have 
caused the energy commodity prices to reach record levels in the international 
market. The energy prices that directly impact Turkcell Group fluctuate depending 
on the prices of thermal resources such as natural gas and coal, and the capacity 
for renewable production. Parallel to the simultaneous USD-based price increases 
in energy commodities, and the domestic drought-induced decline in production of 
our hydroelectric power plants which is our country’s largest source of electricity 
production, the electricity prices in Turkey are also increasing similar to the European 
markets. Another factor that increases the prices in TRY just like commodity prices is 
the increase in exchange rate. 
Turkcell Group continues to take two main actions in response to rising energy prices. 
The first action is based on the target to meet the Group's energy consumption 
needs mostly from its own power plants until 2030 as an investor in large-scale 
projects on renewable energy resources. Acquisition of Karadağ Wind Energy Power 
Plant with an installed power of 18 MW has been completed in 2021 as a first step of 
this strategy. The second action is to protect ourselves from temporary fluctuations in 
the market by signing long-term, fixed-price energy purchasing contracts whenever 
possible. We have been purchasing energy in fixed prices through Turkcell Energy 
Solutions since 2018.

Risks related to managing relationships with third parties
To avoid employee mistakes and manage processes and projects more effectively, Turkcell Academy 
analyzes training needs, completes assignments and designs content, and then provide technical, 
personal development and competency training in areas of employee development.This includes risks that arise from inefficient management of third parties. These may 
occur due to failure of third parties in fulfilling their responsibilities completely and 
accurately, their activities violating company procedures and legal regulations, or 
their fraudulent behavior. In order to minimize risk of potential impact on operations 
and targets, agreements are made with business partners which have obtained 
legal opinion.
Within the scope of the supply chain disruption risk, the related developments 
causing the scarcity of current supply are being closely monitored. Estimations for 
the future periods are being made and actions are being taken evaluating the order 
planning for impacted products' supply duration. 
Macroeconomic political and geopolitical uncertainty risks
Competition risks
Customer risksThis includes the risks of worsening expectations and/or the current situation due to 
economic effects such as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and inflation on 
customers’ consumption habits and of political and geopolitical uncertainties. Global 
trends, economic indicators, competition, revenue and subscriber data are regularly 
monitored by Turkcell. 
This includes the risk of being put at a disadvantage in competing activities or 
technological and/ or sectoral developments. In this context, market and competitor 
activities are closely monitored and efforts are made to respond to such competing 
activities with timely actions.
These risks include the risks of not being able to meet the customers' demands/
expectations due to demographic changes (age, training, income, etc.) in the 
customer groups or not being able to understand the customers' needs.

of Risks Committee. The Internal Audit 
mechanism operates with a risk-based 
audit approach. In line with this approach,

In parallel to our strategic focus areas, we have four main 
competencies stemming from our 28 years of experience 
and know-how, which distinguish us from other operators in 
the sector and strengthen our leadership position. While our 
strategic focus areas steer our Company’s operations, we 
also ensure that all business lines evaluate opportunities in an 
effectively manner.
Our strategic focus areas are re-evaluated annually 
through meetings and surveys with the participation of 
employees from every level, and therefore, we ensure the 
consistent reflection of our strategy based on current trends, 
opportunities, and competencies.By evaluating global 
trends and potential 
growth areas in Turkey, 
we have determined 
three strategic focus 
areas in addition to our 
core telecom business 
that builds on our four 
main competencies. Strategic initiatives 
and opportunities
Rising data usage, our upsell efforts and 
our tariff prices which we update in

growth of 13.4% in the mobile segment. We 
gained a net 2.2 million mobile subscribers 
by continuing our focus on increasing 
the value proposition we offer to our 
customers. Accordingly we achieved a 
health revenue growth based both on 
ARPU growth and expanding subscriber 
base. 
As Turkcell, we focus on further increasing our already high corporate segment market 
share and meeting the needs of our customers stemming from digitalization. We prepare 
various campaigns for merchants and SMEs. We stand by small enterprises by offering 
benefits that could support their revenue generation, reduce their expenditures and digitally

largest data center operator, we continue our activities with the vision that Turkey’s 
data should remain in Turkey. In this context, regulatory arrangements concerning 
the storage of data in Turkey have increased the demand for our data centers, thus 
helping us improve our business and contributing to our revenues.
We use our big data, IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) experience and competencies 
in various areas including the development of products and services. The absence 
of accepted major players in IoT and artificial intelligence solutions, which are 
still developing areas, creates an advantage for Turkcell. The Republic of Turkey’s 
national vision to encourage development of domestic and national technologies, is 
considered as an opportunity for Turkcell.
The increasing need for remote solutions during the pandemic period led to 
increased demand for products and services, which we focus on, in the field of 
remote health, education and working solutions.

Increase in demand for contactless payment methods by 
individuals and institutions after the pandemic
The unexpected increase in the post-pandemic e-trade 
volumeThe pandemic period has enabled many people to meet with digital/contactless 
payment systems and resulted in increased use of such systems. The anticipated 
increase in demand even after the pandemic creates an opportunity for Turkcell. It 
is foreseen that people in Turkey and around the globe will continue to be inclined 
towards contactless, digital payment methods in the post-pandemic era.
Paycell Virtual Pos product is now used in workplaces with substantial trading 
volume and it is possible for merchants to offer their services without needing to 
sign separate agreements with different banks which creates benefits for both the 
merchant and Paycell.

Our financial capital is the key 
economic input of all activities we 
carry out on our journey towards 
creating stakeholder value. Bringing 
our customers together with 
innovative services through a strong 
telecom infrastructure, providing the 
cutting-edge technologies for the 
use of our country and our people, 
benefiting the society through social 
projects, creating suitable employment 
conditions for our employees and 
creating value for our shareholders 
require a strong financial performance. 
In this respect, strong and sustainable 
financial performance is among our 
material topics.Strong financial 
performance
While targeting generation of strong 
operational profit through revenues from 
our operations, we focus on efficient 
management of working capital requirement 
and realizing our capital expenditures based 
on demand, thus supporting cash flow 
generation. 
Risk management is one of our main agenda 
items as we operate in an emerging market. 
We follow a prudent risk management 
approach to protect our business model 
against macroeconomic and financial 
fluctuations with hedging practices. 
Accordingly, in order to realize real revenue 
growth and eventually minimize inflationary 
pressure over our operational profitability, we 
give importance to pricing our products and

in our country. We also promote growth 
through subscriber net additions as well 
as our focus areas such as consumer and 
corporate digital service revenues and techfin. 
Meanwhile, we ensure that our balance sheet 
is resilient to the currency movements by 
actively utilizing hedging instruments. 
We aim to be prepared against financial 
crisis and shocks by focusing on keeping our 
liquidity sources strong. On the other hand, 
we contribute to efficient use of capital 
through a well-balanced management of 
our leverage level. We focus on implementing 
an effective financing approach by closely 
following up credit and capital markets and 
using a variety of financing instruments in 
right currency, cost and maturity terms. We 
contribute to working capital management 
by effectively managing our collections. 
The efficient capital allocation is another 
important matter in terms of our financial 
capital. In this framework, while maintaining 
our efforts to direct our capital resources to 
more profitable areas that generate higher 
growth, we remain focused on our objective 
of revealing the real value of our assets in our 
balance sheet.
As part of our solid corporate governance 
efforts, we disclose our financial 
management approach to our stakeholders 
through our integrated annual reports, 
quarterly and annual results announcements, 
our website, and the physical/virtual investor 
meetings we attend and events we hold. 
Accordingly, we pursue our efforts to increase 
the market capitalization and trading volume 
of our Company, to diversify and deepen 
the investor profile and increase the share

With the accelerating vaccination process, 
2021 was a year in which the pandemic 
restrictions were gradually removed 
throughout the world, normalization in daily 
life accelerated and as a result of these, 
global commerce and countries’ economies 
eventually entered into a stage of recovery. 
Turkey has once again maintained its growth 
performance in 2021 in the light of these 
developments, however, particularly in the 
second half of the year  the depreciation of 
the TRY led to an upward trend in inflation.  
As Turkcell, we continued our strong 
operational and financial performance in 
2021 in an environment where challenging 
macroeconomic conditions were prevailing, 
thanks to our diversified business model with 
our strategic focus areas and our customer-
oriented approach. In 2021, our consolidated 
revenues increased by 23.4% year-on-
year to TRY 35.9 billion. Our approach for 
the balanced management of subscriber 
base expansion and ARPU growth, strong 
performance of our international operations, 
positive contribution of our techfin business 
and growth in equipment sales stood out as 
the main drivers behind this performance. The revenues from our operations 
stands out as one of the essential 
input of all our activities that we 
conduct in terms of value creation. 
Consequently, we bring our innovative 
services to our customers, improve the 
conditions of our employees, benefit 
the country’s economy and our people 
through the investments we make, 
distribute dividends to our investors, 
in summary create value for all our 
stakeholders.  Revenues from 
operationsWith the positive impact of our strong revenue 
growth and disciplinary cost management 
implementations, we recorded TRY 15.0 billion 
EBITDA with an increase of 22.4% in 2021. Factors 
such as the savings accomplished through our 
hybrid operating model and the relatively limited 
number of business trips continued to positively 
affect our operational profitability. In addition 
to this, the revenue share of digital channels 
was 22% as of the last quarter of 2021, helping 
us manage our sales expenses more efficiently. 
On the other hand, higher revenue share of new 
business areas that have lower profitability, such 
as equipment sales and energy business offset 
these savings and efficiency improvements. 
In 2021, the Turkish Lira depreciated by 44% 
and 40% against the US Dollar and Euro, 
respectively. With our prudent financial 
risk management approach, we have kept 
the impact of currency movements on our 
financials at a limited level in a period when 
macroeconomic developments were quite 
challenging. We have achieved TRY 5.0 billion 
net income in 2021 thanks to our strong operational performance and effective risk 
management. The deferred tax income 
impact resulting from the asset revaluation 
in accordance with Article 11 of the Law No. 
7326 also positively impacted our net income 
performance in 2021. Please refer to our 
consolidated financial statements and notes 
for details.

We continued our investments in 2021 with 
the aim of bringing our customers together 
with the latest technologies. With the 
increasing usage need during the pandemic 
period, we continued to invest in our mobile 
infrastructure capacity with the aim of 
providing the highest quality service to our 
customers. In this period, the demand for high 
quality fixed broadband connections also 
increased rapidly. Accordingly, we accelerated 
our fiber infrastructure investments and 
You may access the details of our domestic network investments and 5G activities in the

We put emphasis on our free cash flow 
performance in order to sustain our strong 
financial performance and create value 
for our investors. While our free cash flow 
was at negative levels in 2014-2018 due 
to 4.5G investments, it turned positive as 
these investments were completed in the 
following period. While we created TRY 3.4 
billion free cash flow in 2020, we achieved 
a free cash flow of TRY 1.1 billion in 2021 
despite challenging conditions as a result of 
strong operational performance. As the loan portfolio contraction of our financing business 
stabilized in 2021, this did not lead to a 
positive impact on free cash flow generation 
this year which was a positive factor last 
year.  Additionally, our demand-driven capital 
expenditures, of which positive contribution 
we will continue to see in the upcoming 
periods, were also effective in lower free cash 
flow in this period when compared to last 
year. 
added 653 thousand new homepasses. 
Additionally, we continued our investments 
in Ukraine to provide higher quality service 
to more customers, our largest international 
operations. Furthermore, the depreciation of 
the TRY against foreign currencies led to an 
increase in capital expenditures. Accordingly, 
our operational capital expenditures 
(excluding license fee) amounted to 21.2% of 
our total revenues in 2021.

Business model 
hedging practices
We continued updating the prices of our products and 
services in line with the current economic conditions in 2021. 
Besides pricing, we focused on increasing the postpaid 
subscriber base share and upselling to higher packages 
with richer value propositions to continue ARPU growth. 
Mobile ARPU (excluding M2M) growth was 13.4% while fixed 
residential ARPU growth was 11.9% year-on-year. In 2021, 
where inflation followed an upward path, we followed a 
balanced growth strategy supported by subscriber additions 
at the same time. Accordingly, we expanded our subscriber 
base with 2.7 million annual net additions. Additionally, our 
digital services and techfin solutions, which provide higher 
revenue growth compared to our telecom services, also 
supported our consolidated revenue growth. Our international 
businesses and equipment revenues also contributed to the 
total revenues. Accordingly, we achieved real revenue growth 
in a year dominated by difficult economic conditions, while 
minimizing inflationary pressures on operational profitability. In 2021, we managed 
to minimize the 
impact of challenging 
macroeconomic 
developments on our 
financials, thanks to our 
business model hedging 
practices. Pricing our 
products and services 
according to the current 
price developments 
in the market, using 
hedging instruments 
against our foreign 
currency-denominated 
borrowings, keeping 
strong liquidity 
resources and 
collection performance 
management were the 
areas we focused on 
again this year.  
We continued our prudent risk management approach throughout 2021 with regard to 
our foreign currency-denominated debt portfolio in our balance sheet. In this respect, we 
continued to hold majority of our cash in hard currencies as a natural hedging mechanism. 
As of the end of 2021, excluding FX swap transactions 76% of the cash in our balance sheet 
was in USD, 12% was in EUR and 12% was in TRY. In addition, we kept on actively utilizing 
hedging instruments within the scope of our prudent risk management approach. In the last 
quarter of the year, during the rapid depreciation of TRY against foreign currencies, we also 
used short-term hedging instruments to support the effectiveness of our portfolio. While 80% 
of our total debt before hedging transactions is in foreign currency as of the end of 2021, 
the ratio declines to 54% when the effects of hedging instruments are included. In order to 
reduce our risk by diversifying our foreign exchange transactions and position, we prioritized 
local currency-based trade with our suppliers. We signed Turkish Lira denominated payment 
agreements with our largest suppliers to protect our foreign exchange position. Accordingly, as 
of the end of 2021, we had a net FX short position of USD 191 million in line with our ambition 
of keeping an FX neutral position, which we define as a level between minus USD 200 million 
to plus USD 200 million.
Hedging instruments also protect us against interest rate risk in the market. Accordingly, 
approximately 36% of our total debt has a floating interest rate as of the end of 2021, while 
our fixed rate borrowing share is at around 64% including the impact of hedging instruments. 
Another important aspect of our risk management approach is the fact that participating 
cross-currency swap instruments cover both principal and interest payments of the relevant 
debt service until maturity. Additionally, while conducting these agreements, we work with 
reliable and reputable financial institutions recognized by international markets. 143 142 2VALUE CREATING

In addition to our strong cash position, our 
committed credit lines of USD 567 million, as 
well as our strong free cash flow generation 
performance support our liquidity position. 
Another important focus area concerning 
liquidity is debt management. Despite 
the significant depreciation of the Turkish 
Lira against the USD and EUR in 2021, we 
managed to maintain our leverage (net debt/
EBITDA) at 1.1x, thanks to cash generation. 
Until the next technology investment cycle, 
our goal is to maintain our leverage level 
with cash flow generation and to prepare for 
future investments. While we took timely actions for collections, 
our customers were also sensitive to their 
payments given that telecom services are an 
integral part of their lives. These two factors 
enabled us to maintain our strong collection 
performance in 2021. We also sustained a 
robust collection performance in our financing 
business in 2021 in the pandemic environment, 
continuing to keep our cost of risk below 
sector averages. We followed a prudent 
approach in granting loans to customers. We 
took several metrics including the payment 
performance of our customers for their 
telecom invoices, as well as credit bureau 
scores into consideration as part of our 
evaluation process. As a telecom company that operates in emerging markets, 
we need to be prepared against volatility in financial markets, 
and sustain a strong liquidity position to ensure operational 
continuity. Liquidity management is therefore a crucial part for 
our financial capital. In this respect, we held TRY 18.6 billion in 
cash, mostly in foreign currency on our balance sheet as of 
the end of 2021. This amount covers our entire debt service 
until the end of 2024. 145 144 2VALUE CREATING

Efficient capital 
allocation
In the last quarter of 2021, we mandated J.P.Morgan Securities plc 
in order to evaluate options of partial stake sale at our subsidiary 
Turkcell Ödeme ve Elektronik Para Hizmetleri A.Ş., which offers 
innovative payment solutions under the Paycell brand. We aim to 
provide resources in order to accelerate growth in existing and new 
markets as part of our strategy to expand our techfin business.
In addition, Superonline stands out as one of the important assets 
in our balance sheet with its size, profitable operations and revenue 
growth profile. Our tower company continues its activities as 
another important asset in our balance sheet with its portfolio 
consisting of 11,060 towers in 4 countries. We may assess potential 
strategic options including public offerings, infrastructure sharing or 
sales to strategic/minority shareholders regarding these assets. Our 
Digital Business Services business line that provides a wide range 
of services which provide competitive advantage to our corporate 
customers, also stands out as a valuable business partner for 
international players operating in the Turkish market. We may also 
consider strategic actions related to this line of business in the 
coming period.
Within this scope, we regularly monitor market conditions and 
investor interest, and our purpose is to unlock the real values of the 
assets in our balance sheet by performing various capital markets 
and strategic transactions, if appropriate conditions arise. As Turkcell, we invest in 
areas with high demand 
and value creation 
potential, such as digital 
services, digital business 
services, techfin offers 
and fiber connection 
solutions within the 
framework of efficient 
capital management. 
In this context, we 
aim at creating value 
for our stakeholders 
by strengthening our 
financial and operational 
performance. We 
have adopted the 
approach of financing 
our investments in these 
areas through active 
portfolio management 
actions in addition to 
borrowing and cash flow.  SDG 8.2
Financing 
diversity
While diversifying our sources of finance, we aim to benefit 
from sustainability-themed loans. Accordingly, we had used 
a 3-year term EUR 50 million loan from BNP Paribas in May 
2019. Based on the agreement we have made with the 
same bank, we have increased this loan to EUR 70 million 
in 2021 and extended its term to December 2026. The new 
sustainability objectives of the agreement are the share of 
renewable energy in electricity consumption, the share of 
renewable energy produced within the group and the annual 
amount of electronic waste collected. We aim at creating 
alternative funding 
methods and resources 
and developing strong 
market relations 
in order to provide 
financing diversity 
to our strong equity 
position. Accordingly, we 
continue to utilize loans 
obtained from national 
and international banks, 
issue Eurobonds in 
international markets, 
bonds, bills, lease 
certificates and Asset 
Backed Securities in 
local markets and obtain 
ECA loans for financing 
procurements from 
foreign suppliers. We 
also use sustainable 
financing (sustainability 
indexed loan, green loan) 
as part of our diversified 
funding resources.SDG 8.4
In line with the company's objectives, we 
pursue our efforts on sustainable/green 
financing transactions in 2021 without

UNGC CFO Taskforce
We are among the 
founding members of 
the UN Global Compact 
CFO Task Force initiative, 
which aims to develop 
sustainable corporate 
finance models and 
tools in line with United 
Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals. The 
CFO Task Force aims to 
make the concept of 
sustainable finance an 
important factor in the 
policy-making processes 
of the leading institutions 
of the global business 
world, to achieve 
sustainable development 
goals and to create an 
extensive, liquid, and 
effective market for 
investments that serve 
these goals.In this initiative, where the CFOs of global companies 
from different sectors take part, Osman Yılmaz, Executive 
Vice President of Finance, also takes part, representing 
Turkey and Turkcell on this platform. In line with the SDGs, 
this organization identified the critical task areas in 2020 
as 'Approach and Measurement', 'Integrated Strategy 
and Investments', 'Integrated Corporate Finance' and 
'Integrated Communication and Reporting'.  As of 2021, 71 
global-scale companies from 19 different sectors with a 
total market value of more than USD 1.7 trillion constitute 
the CFO Task Force. Within the scope of this project, 
the project contributes to the achievement of the SDGs 
while developing a common policy to achieve the goals 
set out in the UN 2030 Agenda.

responsibilities of the business world in the fields of 
human rights, labor standards, environment and anti-
corruption determined by the United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC) and based on the United Nations 
declarations, it is aimed that companies not only 
change their culture by developing their strategies and 
procedures, but also lay the groundwork for long-term 
success. The declarations, on which these determined 
principles are based on, are the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization 
(ILO) Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at 
Work, the United Nations Rio Declaration on Environment 
and Development and the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption.

out by the working groups formed by the individuals 
determined by the companies themselves, the CFO Task 
Force published its most updated manifesto at the 76th 
United Nations Meeting held in New York in September 
2021. Accordingly, while the initiative aims to reach 1,000 
members in 2023, it aims to invest approximately USD 
500 billion in sustainability by 2025.

journey driven by our powerful communication and interaction. We believe that our people-
oriented employee experience approach is an indispensable part of our corporate culture. 
Our employees are our brand ambassador and add value to Turkcell. We deem our focus 
on employee experience as an indispensable part of our corporate culture in order to make 
our employees feel happier, more valuable and efficient during their onboarding, exit and all

management
In our human resource processes, we comply with applicable 
laws and regulations. We communicate all operational changes 
that could significantly impact our employees within the legal 
notice period through our internal communication channels. As 
Turkcell, we oppose discrimination based on gender, age, belief, 
ethnicity, nationality, marital status, health status, and physical 
capacity in all of our business activities. We continuously improve 
our human resources practices which are based on inclusion and 
diversity and extending equal opportunities to all individuals in a 
manner that respects human rights.  As the Turkcell Group family 
of around 26,000 employees, we adapt to the requirements of the 
rapidly evolving digital age with agility in order to better respond 
to customer needs and we continuously improve our skills with 
training programs with rich content.
With Turkcell Human Resources, we design all of our human 
resources processes which touch upon the employee experience 
including onboarding and exit procedures. Taking advantage 
of the power of digitalization, we design and manage our 
compensation and additional benefits policy. We also integrate 
talent, performance and career management in accordance with 
the needs of our employees. All of these are done through our 
data-based approach. Consequently, thanks to the data analytics 
we gather during these processes, we deliver exemplary results. 
With the cooperation of Turkcell teams, we determine the goals 
and risks of our business processes, define roles and responsibilities.

Flexible working model
The expectations of employees have recently 
been changing at an incredible pace due to the 
demand for work/life balance.  Closely monitoring 
the employee needs and trends, Turkcell had 
identified the needs of its employees and had 
adopted its working style years ago. Accordingly, 
we have been offering our employees a variety 
of flexible working options since 2016. We were 
applying the remote working model, called “mobile working” which requires only four days in 
the office and the "office station" system which 
allowed working in Turkcell plazas located all 
across Turkey. With the "Flexible Working Hours" 
practice, we also provided the opportunity to 
start working until 10:00 and end the day until 
19:00. In other words, Turkcell employees have 
had the opportunity to define their own working 
hours and to work remotely four days a week per 
month for the last five years. They have had the 
privilege to work from a Turkcell office location 
and had a certain amount of discretion on 
managing when, how and where to work.
We prioritized transparency and organizational 
participation in planning and announcing the 
new working model, which was implemented 
in Turkcell after the pandemic. Therefore, from 
the beginning of the pandemic, we have formed 
specific project teams and committees with different employees of different characters. 
The new model has been developed by HR in 
collaboration with employees and leaders from 
all functions. Workshops focusing on managers 
and employees have been organized. The "Digital 
Office Committee" composed of managers from 
different functions across the organization and the 
"HR Volunteers Committee” comprising specialists 
of different functions have been created. Through 
regular meetings, these committees worked on 
the problems linked to the pandemic and remote 
working, came up with ideas and designed the 
new model. 
Following the first COVID-19 case in Turkey, 
Turkcell employees started to work remotely as 
per our relentless sensitivity around health and our 
focus on employee experience. As the pioneering 
company in remote working, we designed a new 
working model, together with our employees in 
order to adapt to the changing needs of the new 
normal. We also envisioned the working model 
and ways of doing business in the future while 
designing this new model. Our 'Flexible Working 
Model' launched with the motto, 'If You are There, 
Anywhere is Turkcell' removed all limits. Thanks 
to the model which is effective as of March 2021, 
depending on the job requirements, all employees 
are now able to work from the office or remotely.
As Turkcell employees work from anywhere, they 
prioritize accessibility. Accordingly, they meet their 
internet connection needs at their houses through 
the employee campaigns offered by Turkcell 
and they enjoy additional benefits through other 
special offers.  
The flexible work needs of Turkcell employees 
are now met with the Turkcell Life-Digital Office 
application developed by Turkcell's engineers. 
Thanks to the Digital Office module, Turkcell 
employees can reserve working spaces, meeting 
rooms and parking spaces for their vehicles at 
any Turkcell office they choose. Digital Office is 
not only designed for office needs but also for 
appointments at the firm's hair dresser, fitness 
center, doctor's office, pedagogue, dietitian or 
psychologist.
Turkcell employees have the 'Flexible Working 
Hours' in order to work flexibly while maintaining 
their work/life balance. This allows them to start 
working at 10:00 and finish working at 19:00. 
Thanks to the Hours without Meetings' practice, 
our employees can focus on their works which require individual attention and focus. Additionally, 
in order to remind the necessity of being offline, 
we make improvements such as sending an 
automatic warning message in order not to 
hold a meeting, not to send an e-mail outside 
the working hours and to increase meeting 
productivity.
“Flexible Working Support” that is renewed each 
year is provided to Turkcell employees in order to 
improve their working environments. In order to 
maintain the productivity and sustainability of this 
model, Turkcell implements this financing support 
in each year.
Turkcell believes that face-to-face interactions 
are key to keep alive team spirit and increases 
motivation and synergy in post-pandemic 
world by utilizing the power of face-to-face 
communication and also promotes the binding 
power of face-to-face communication in healthy 
days.
Turkcell’s Flexible Working Model is based on 
the ground of “trust” in employee and designed 
to provide its employees with the best digital 
experience, employ and retain highly motivated 
and committed top talents. 171 170 2VALUE CREATING

Diversity, inclusion, and

order to improve employee engagement and 
satisfaction by always listening our employee’s 
expectations on business management. As Human 
Resources, we always support our employees. We aim to make sure that Turkcell is the most 
preferred workplace in the eyes of our employees 
through our “Digital HR” vision and human-focused 
decent business practices.Our decent business 
practices
We assure our equal opportunity, inclusion and diversity principles 
with our practices. In all of our operations, there were no incidents 
that were reported by our employees or third parties against 
Turkcell İletişim Hizmetleri A.Ş. in 2021 on discrimination. And there 
are no lawsuits filed against Turkcell about discrimination based on 
language, religion, race, belief, ethnic origin, political or ideological 
point of view, marital status, sexual orientation and gender.
We state our commitment to compliance with the principles set 
forth in our Human Rights Policy announced at the beginning 
of 2021 as part of our relations with our employees, customers, 
business partners and all our stakeholders. Thereby, we aim 
to ensure compliance to requirements of national legislation 
and international regulations that we are subject to, regarding 
employment conditions. 
We respect the fundamental rights of our employees defined in 
our policy as well. We protect the rights of both parties of the 
employment contract with our human rights practices. With our 
equal pay for equal work policy, there is no basic salary difference 
between our female and male employees. In order to prevent 
the incidence of child labor and forced labor, we adopt the ILO 
(International Labor Organization) standards across our entire value 
chain, particularly for our suppliers. As protection of human 
rights and respect for it 
lies at core of our duties, 
we implement human 
resources practices 
that ensure equal 
opportunities for all 
individuals, and support 
inclusion and diversity 
and improve ourselves 
each day in this sense. 
Within the scope of our 
Human Rights Policy, as 
Turkcell, we carry out 
our activities to prevent 
discrimination, inequality, 
human rights violations, 
forced labor and child 
labor and continue our 
efforts to adopt these 
values across the supply 
chain.
 SDG 10.4With all of our Turkcell employees and new 
colleagues, who join us from all over Turkey, we 
constantly expand our family and contribute 
to increasing the active workforce. We truly 
believe that gender discrimination is a practice 
of the past and as a leading digital operator 
company, we carry out our duties to highlight 
the work of women especially in STEM (Science, 
Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) areas. In 
order to strengthen women in business and the 
enterprises led by them, we carry out numerous 
activities and take crucial steps in increasing the 
employment of 'women engineers' in Turkey. With 
the help of programs such as "At Turkcell, It Is 
Equal Conditions, Equal Chances" and "Women 
Developing the Future", we aim to increase the 
number of women engineers in technology-
based sectors and their inclusion in the workforce. 
We aim to provide job opportunities for women 
engineers, who are at the beginning of their 
career or professional women whose careers 
were interrupted for various reasons.

We manage our Compensation Policy at all levels based on knowledge, skills and critical 
experience with maximum reliability. We transparently communicate the Remuneration Policy 
of our Board Members and Senior Managers to all our stakeholders. We consider the roles 
where business units experience a decline in talent level or attract skilled personnel and 
benchmark companies which we deem as competitor. Accordingly, we accept wages in 
the labor market as a reference point. Additionally, wages are updated by evaluating talent 
level and recruitment data. We apply our Remuneration Policies impartially by basing all our 
operations on common standards to prevent discrimination between our female and male 
employees performing similar roles and jobs. You may find the ratio of average wage of fresh 
graduates in Turkcell to the minimum wage in the below table. Employee loyalty and 
happiness
We care about the health of our employees and their families 
hence we offer them insurance packages with which they can 
include their spouses and kids as well. As a side benefit, we 
provide all employees of Turkcell life insurance against death and 
life support (critical illness) along with accident and post-illness 
disability insurance. Thanks to Turkcell Pension Plan, we contribute 
to our employees' savings and investments in order to allow them 
to sustain their living standards after retirement.
We carry out practices that support our employees and their 
families. Though legal provision for paternity leave in Turkey is 
5 days, we provide 10 days of leave to our new fathers, so that 
our male employees can provide support in childcare. In order 
to support our working mothers, we extend day nursery aids for 
women who have children of 2-5 years old. We offer mothers and 
fathers paid leaves on the opening days and report card days of 
their kids' school so that they share the excitement of their children 
by being with them on those days.In Turkcell, we prioritize 
the happiness of our 
employees and we work 
towards enabling an 
efficient employment 
experience. We keep 
open dialogue with 
our employees through 
Employee Engagement

Activities implemented to increase 
employee motivation
We organized 'Take Care of Yourself' healthy living activities which 
could create positive impact on the souls, bodies and minds of 
our employees. Accordingly, we brought our employees together 
in online and offline contexts with courses such as fit brain, live 
exercises, healthy breathing, standing tall academy, pleasant 
information and yoga. 
In order to increase employee motivation and communication 
during the pandemic, we organized 'Online Workshops' 
delivered by expert trainers on culture, arts, history and personal 
development. Thanks to our 'Digital Traveler' we also visited 
different destinations in Turkey through live tour sessions conducted 
in the digital environment by our expert tour guides. We organized 
trivia quizzes, named “Lucky Knowers”, with various prizes every 
Friday throughout the year. 
Every Wednesday, we conducted 'Coffee Breaks' with surprise 
CXO visits in order to increase the synergy among our employees 
while working  flexibly and to bring them together with the senior 
management just to chat, mingle, and have conversations outside 
meetings and business-related agendas. In addition, we have been 
bringing our employees together with our CEO Murat Erkan at 
'Breakfast at 8' events since October. 
With the objective of keeping our location-independent 
connections strong, we celebrated our religious holidays such 
as Ramadan and Sacrifice Feast among our employees through 
the 'Turkcell Employees Holiday Greetings' campaign and with 
our elderly people living in nursing homes through the 'Turkcell 
Employees Holiday Greetings with the Elderly' campaign.
We conducted digital live tours to allow the kids of our employees 
to spend enjoyable moments at home and get to know different 
cultures on 'Child Traveler'. With the project 'Dream School' created 
completely in the digital environment, our employees and their kids 
were offered a two-week vacation school program. As Turkcell, we invest 
in the well-being of 
our employees and 
their close families

Our most fundamental 
goal is to create strong 
company results both 
operationally and 
financially with highly

psychologically healthier. 
We offer many practices 
that could serve the 
spiritual and physical 
vitality of Turkcell 
employees and their 
loved ones.
Safe and healthy workspace

priority participation in certification programs at international universities, apprenticeship

allows our employees to clearly see which business results they have contributed and by 
using which competency. Instead of the methodology based on seniority and performance 
criteria which were used in traditional systems, we focus on occupational competencies 
which we believe are more relevant to today’s world and demographic structure.

source of our success and continue our activities accordingly. We work for our technical, 
commercial and support functions to have a flexible and agile structures so that they can

The organizational structures of new business areas are updated in a manner that can rapidly 
adapt to evolving market needs and dynamics. We analyze the status quo by monitoring the 
performance of agile working practices and we observe improvement areas and conduct 
pilot projects. The pilot applications which we find successful are then implemented across

operator, we manage our data centers, which are equipped 
with world-class modern technology, with a focus on 
supporting domestic technology development, 
We operate our base stations, the endpoint of our network 
infrastructure in terms of customer service, based on 
complying with values which go beyond local and global 
standards, in line with our emphasis on environmental and 
public health.
We know that a reliable and fast network with a large 
coverage is of great importance in delivering a successful 
customer experience. In this regard, we continuously improve 
our infrastructure through investments, R&D activities and 
with our technological solutions. Today’s rapid technological

Mobile infrastructure
We carry out activities to improve the coverage area and 
durability of our base stations and towers, which form 
the basis of our telecom business, thereby increasing the 
accessibility of our services.*Total data volume: mobile + fixed
**Due to the base impact resulting from 76% increase in traffic in 2020 following the COVID-19 pandemic, the traffic in 2021 increased by 8%.
The network structure of 
our mobile infrastructure 
is a smart and flexible 
hardware comprising 
mainly our base stations. 
In order to prevent negative impact on public 
health, we operate our base stations below 
the electromagnetic field intensity threshold 
levels as determined  by the Information 
and Communication Technologies Authority 
(ICTA), the regulatory body. These thresholds 
were determined by the ICTA with a 
prudent approach at lower and safer levels 
compared to the exposure limits determined 
by the International Non-Ionizing Radiation 
Protection Board (ICNIRP) and accepted by 
the World Health Organization (WHO). As 
per research in this field, no harm to human 
health has been identified from radio signals 
below ICNIRP limits. The threshold levels 
defined for Turkey by regulation are at 70% of 
the limits determined by ICNIRP, and at 25% 
per device. The maximum limits that a base 
station can be operated at in our country are 
much lower (approximately 25%) compared 
to limits set for European Union countries.
As we are subject to ICTA and its regulations 
in terms of installation and inspection of base Base stations and public health
stations, information regarding the power 
specifications, antenna type, location of the 
station and its surrounding is reported in detail 
to the ICTA, and base stations can be installed 
in approved locations. Once a base station 
is activated, EMR (Electromagnetic Field) 
measurement is conducted by independent 
institutions accredited by the ICTA within one 
week, with the results submitted to the ICTA. 
Moreover, the ICTA also conducts inspections 
and measurements on the base stations. As 
part of the two ICTA criteria that stand out 
with respect to public health, there should be 
no living space within the “Safety Distance” 
determined based on the power output of 
the base station, while its electromagnetic 
field intensity, having been configured 
accordingly, should be within the legal limits. 
Should any failure to comply with the relevant 
ICTA criteria be detected, the base stations 
are dismantled, with significant sanctions or Base stations
The base stations in our network are well equipped to 
demonstrate all capabilities of the technology that we 
provide to our customers. Meanwhile, we can minimize 
environmental impacts of our base stations, which can offer 
multiple technology support (singleRAN), thanks to their more 
compact size and lower energy consumption.Having adopted an 
approach that prioritizes 
public health, we operate 
our base stations utilizing 
the latest technologies 
and with a focus 
on complying with 
national regulations and 
international standards. 
We also prioritize 
preventing visual 
pollution when locating 
them.

Towers
Providing services to telecom operators, radio-TV broadcasters, 
internet service providers, energy companies and public 
institutions in the fields of tower rental, tower build-and-sell, tower 
maintenance and contract management, Global Tower has also 
started to provide its customers satellite communication services 
with end-to-end solution concepts. Global Tower provides closed-
circuit satellite services at over two thousand points over its own 
infrastructure with geographic redundancy, and aims to increase 
its product range and service diversity by following satellite sector 
trends. Global Tower, the 
leading tower company 
in Turkey and one of our 
subsidiaries, operates in 
four countries.
Global Tower has a portfolio of 11,060 
towers as of the end of 2021 and the 
portfolio distribution is as follows; 
Turkey: 8,962 (owned: 4,537, right of use: 
2,235, contract management: 2,190) 
Ukraine: 1,149 (owned) 
Belarus: 834 (right of use) 
TRNC: 115 (right of use) penalties imposed.
As Turkcell, we care about the impact of 
our network management operations on 
public health and implement limits we set 
for ourselves, in addition to those set by the 
relevant legal authorities. In 2021, there were 
no cases that resulted in legal penalties 
against our Company with regards to 
the impact on health of our products and 
services.
We conduct risk assessment tests to ensure 
the safety of our base stations and our teams 
working in the field. We aim to minimize 
risk factors by making improvement actions 
for areas identified as a result of these 
assessments.
During our activities carried out at base 
station sites for installations, it is possible to 
encounter occupational health and safety risks in relation to issues including working 
at height, electrical works, excavation works, 
and vehicle use. We have working principles 
and action plans prepared to prevent these 
risks. Until the end of 2021, 4,735 sites were 
inspected, risk analysis forms were prepared 
for 639 sites, and 210 sites were repaired and 
renewed for a safer working environment.
Moreover, by preparing “Network 
Technologies Geographical Risk Analysis 
Reports” on a regular basis, we aim to 
ensure that our base stations operate 
efficiently, in an environmentally friendly 
manner and in accordance with health 
and safety regulations considering the 
interaction between human, environment and 
telecommunications.Global Tower closely monitors 
the transformation process of the 
telecommunications infrastructure sector 
from tower management to infrastructure 
management throughout the world and plans 
to introduce new business lines in this sector 
to its customers. Meanwhile, it is observed 
that mobile operators in our country have a positive stance on infrastructure sharing and 
the consolidation model pioneered by Global 
Tower in parallel with global developments. 
With the new regulations to be made in 
this area, a crucial step would be taken in 
terms of operational savings and resource 
efficiency.

Telco Cloud
On the back of virtualization, we integrate infrastructures 
for network applications and achieve CAPEX and OPEX 
efficiency through horizontal and vertical architectures. Along 
with savings on investment, we have been able to deliver 
services faster using similar hardware and infrastructures 
for virtualized services and solutions. Upon migration of our 
core network infrastructure for mobile internet and HD voice 
services over 4.5G to the virtual network, we continued 
growing our Telco Cloud in 2021 through capacity increases. 
We make all our mobile core network investments on our 
Telco Cloud infrastructure.We have virtualized 
60% of our mobile and 
fixed core network 
infrastructure to date. 
Central management and orchestration 
are becoming increasingly important with 
greater system diversity and volumes 
in NFVI (Network Function Virtualization 
Infrastructure) infrastructure. In order to 
meet the rising communication needs of our 
customers on a timely and seamless basis, 
we utilize central MANO (MANagement and 
Orchestration) solution, which enables us to 
manage core network system life cycles with 
a faster and more flexible approach. 
Monitoring KPIs related to the architectural 
components of the virtual infrastructure and the ability to implement root cause 
analysis regarding the relationship between 
these components are crucial in sustaining 
the quality of network services offered to 
our customers. In this context, we continue 
integrating the new network products and 
services we have installed on the Telco Cloud 
into our NFVI Service Assurance infrastructure 
to manage customer experience more 
effectively through the virtual infrastructure. 
VoiceX Program
We designed and developed the 4.5G HD Voice 
network infrastructure fully on the Turkcell Telco 
Cloud as part of the VoiceX program. This 
architecture enables higher flexibility in capacity 
and service management. Additionally, we have 
been able to implement capacity increases in our 
HD Voice network with high investment efficiency 
through the Turkcell Telco Cloud in line with our 
network virtualization strategy.In 2021, we reached a 
much higher network 
capacity along with 
the technological 
transformation in our 
4.5G HD Voice network 
with the completion of 
efforts related to the 
VoiceX program which 
we started in 2020.We increased our HD Voice network capacity 
to two and a half times in terms of number of 
subscribers and quadrupled it in call capacity per 
subscriber. Therefore we are able to provide our 
services with a significantly higher capacity in 
instances of higher communication need resulting 
in intensive traffic on our network, such as natural 
disasters, special days, or a pandemic.

In order to maintain the highest level of service quality for 
the customer, we consider it critically important to detect 
potential failures in the network and services before they 
occur, take proactive steps, and provide permanent solutions 
by taking preventive actions.
While the significance of instant responses and fail-safe 
operations increases on a daily basis to ensure service 
continuity, the need for human resources also intensifies 
across our rapidly growing and complex network, which 
accommodates an increasing number of managed 
equipment and services. Zero Touch transformation, which 
will enable the full and end-to-end automation of the 
network and service management, has turned into a critical 
requirement to provide services rapidly and ensure the 
economic sustainability of diverse services delivered by digital 
services providers.
Investing in domestic 
equipment
By adapting innovative and latest technologies, which provide 
efficiency in our infrastructure, we make a difference in the 
market. 
The obligation to use domestic products as part of 4.5G 
license is expected to be incorporated in the 5G auction, 
which is to take place in the near future. Meanwhile, the fact 
that the domestic product ecosystem has not been fully 
developed in our country results in operators failing to fill 
the quotas set in licenses and result in certain contractual 
penalties.In line with our mission 
to create value for our 
country, we support 
the technological 
development and 
digitalization process of 
Turkey with our efforts 
on developing domestic 
technology and 
equipment. In 2020, as a result of the digitalization 
efforts we initiated in the past years, we 
substantially automated service monitoring 
and failure notification activities carried 
out for the access network.  In 2021, we 
extended our activities as part of Zero Touch, 
which is among the focus areas of Network 
Technologies, by incorporating other network 
operation processes. Organizing hackathon 
events to spread the use of automation 
technologies in network operation, we 
increase operational efficiency through implemented solutions and help disseminate 
this culture as well. Additionally, we aim to 
contribute to process of establishing the 
standards by taking part in international 
platforms and be one of the first operators 
achieving the "Zero Touch" transformation 
across the network. As part of this effort, 
we have participated in the ETSI (European 
Telecommunications Standards Institute) 
ZSM (Zero Touch Network and Service 
Management) group.

architecture, which is part of the preparation 
process for the 5G, enables the use of new 
generation technologies.
Strong fiber 
infrastructure
Turkcell's fiber backbone is now available in all 81 cities of 
Turkey, however, it is our aim to take real fiber internet to 
the homes of our customers having initiated a fiber initiative. 
Accordingly, we expanded our fiber infrastructure by adding 
653 thousand homepasses in 2021.By delivering rapid, 
high quality and 
comprehensive services 
to our customers, we 
maintain efforts to 
facilitate access to the 
internet, which has 
become one of basic 
needs.SDG 11.A
We managed to deliver fiber internet service 
to the homes in 28 cities with our investments 
and carry on with efforts to expand our 
coverage. We are aware of the substantially 
increasing need for internet and access to 
information due to the pandemic and our 
responsibility in this area and we continue 
our investments at a great pace. We develop 
our fiber internet infrastructure, high speed 
internet offerings and new technological 
solutions. As Turkcell, we provide fiber to the 
home access to households at speeds of up 
to 10 Gbps via globally accepted G-PON/
XGS-PON technology. This value is an upper 
limit and may vary depending on variables 
such as tariff type, fiber Internet usage 
density, and the maximum speed the modem 
can support. While the average fixed internet 
speed in Turkey is around 28 Mbit, we provide 
faster internet connection to our customers 
with our strong and expanding infrastructure.
In 2021, the number of our customers who 
are subscribed to fiber packages over 100 
Mbps has more than tripled compared to the 
previous year. 
SDG 9.BAs the first operator to launch the SD-WAN 
service, we offered it to our corporate 
customers. We provided security and access 
services simultaneously as a single service. 
We created solutions to reduce costs, while 
increasing production capacities.
We leverage our services such as Enterprise 
Wi-Fi as part of managed services to 
address the changing needs of corporate 
and wholesale customers. We continue to 
offer newest technologies such as our Wi-Fi 
service, SMS integration, logging, and Wi-Fi 6.
While we continue to expand our fiber 
infrastructure, we also offer high quality

Strong spectrum
Transformation of technologies used in the telecom industry 
as a result of rapid technological growth, high cost of 
infrastructure investments, and the need to make maximum 
use of long economic lives require us to build a technology 
agnostic spectrum infrastructure which could be adapted to 
developments in the technology.
Leveraging our broad spectrum, we aim to maintain the high 
service quality, as proven by the maximum 1.6* Gbps speed  
that we offer with 4.5G technology, with 5G technology 
which is expected to be introduced in the upcoming periods. With the frequency that 
has the largest spectrum, 
Turkcell has the largest 
license allocation that 
can be used in mobile 
communications services 
in Turkey. With this 
spectrum of frequencies, 
which is 34% and 68% 
broader than that of 
other operators, our 
customers take the 
advantage of the highest 
quality of services.You may find detailed information on 5G trends that will lead 
to changes and developments in the telecom sector and many 
other business areas in the Trends section.
Refarming
We have increased significantly the resource allocated to 
4.5G technology as part of city-based implementations, 
prioritizing metropolitan cities. In this regard, we created 
additional network capacity to meet increasing data usage 
particularly during the pandemic, while increasing customer 
experience. We aim to increase the 
spectrum resources to be 
used in 4.5G technology 
due to increasing 4.5G 
data traffic. We will plan 
and implement activities 
in relation to frequency 
transformation and inter-
technology refarming 
that will enable 
spectrum efficiency.
High speed, high quality and inclusive services; 
access to information and Internet for everyone
We maintain our high network availability via our data 
accessibility rate of 99.971% calculated over traffic loss in our 
mobile network, and our low interruption rate of 0.246% in 
mobile voice calls.
* This value is an upper limit and represents theoretical peak values. The speed that the customer can receive may vary depending on the 
maximum speed that the terminal can support, its location and distance from the base station, the configuration of the base station, the 
instant traffic density in the network and the number of subscribers currently receiving service from the field.We continue to 
invest in and improve 
our networks and 
infrastructure to 
provide faster, more 
inclusive, and higher 
quality services to our 
customers.
We have reduced our carbon emissions by generating 8.6 MWh of electricity with 5 
solar panels that we added in 2021 to our 10 portable solar fields established in 2019

Data centers
We have 40 thousand square meter white space in our 8 
data centers, 4 being new generation. As the leader of digital 
transformation in Turkey, we provide hosting, cloud services 
and create cost advantage and increased operational 
efficiency for more than 3,000 corporate customers. By 
providing 24/7 uninterrupted service we enable business 
continuity and expert Turkcell engineers provide remote 
assistance and solve problems swiftly in extraordinary 
circumstances. 
Our data center in Ankara, the largest in Turkey 
with 12 thousand m2 of white space, and our data 
centers in Izmir, Gebze, and Çorlu, which became 
operational in 2021,  have been built with resistance 
to earthquakes up to magnitude of 9 and have 
systems rooms that can withstand fire for 120 
minutes. In our data centers, we carry out various 
activities to establish and spread environmentally-
friendly practices. Roof type solar panels are 
installed at the Ankara and Çorlu Data Center to 
produce approximately 700 thousand kWh of 
electricity annually and to meet our data centers 
energy  consumption. With our LEED (Leadership 
in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold certified 
data centers, we aim to set a pioneering example 
not only in terms of the technology itself, but also of 
our impact on the environment. As Turkey’s largest 
data center operator, 
we sustain our leading 
position in accordance 
with our vision that 
Turkey’s data should 
remain in Turkey. We 
reinforced our leadership 
by launching “Europe 
Data Center”. 
We prioritize cybersecurity in our data centers and offer solutions through 
locally developed technologies.
Our Ankara and Gebze data centers 
were awarded the Operational 
Sustainability Gold certificate, valid 
for 3 years, by the Uptime Institute, 
which inspects data centers at the 
international level. SDG 7.2 SDG 9.1 SDG 9.4 SDG 13.1
Furthermore, we attach utmost importance to the use of domestically manufactured 
products in the construction process of our data centers and increase our domestic 
product rate with data centers we have built. Accordingly, we increased the ratio of 
domestic products used in our Europe Data Center, which opened in 2021, to 75%.
The interaction of our manufactured 
capital with our other capitals
We pay utmost attention to public health via our ERM 
practices at our base stations, which are much stricter 
than stipulated by operative regulations and standards, 
thereby contributing to our social values and relations.
We strengthen our intellectual capital with the solutions 
we create as a result of our R&D activities. We also 
strengthen our financial capital with the economic value 
we create.Our manufactured 
capital provides 
technical infrastructure, 
operability and speed 
for all our services and 
products. Although 
our infrastructure and 
data centers create 
negative value due to 
energy consumption 
via our natural capital, 
we actively conduct 
efficiency and saving 
activities to reduce such 
impact.

innovative business 
culture based on 
strong performance 
in systems, processes 
and technology is 
essential for our strategic 
initiatives and business 
model to achieve the 
most efficient and 
effective results. We transform our corporate culture with value creating and innovative solutions 
developed by our R&D workforce of 1,216 employees and aim for adoption of these 
solutions by our stakeholders.
Innovation and 
entrepreneurship
We continue to offer innovative solutions in national and 
international markets by developing new technologies. In 
addition to being a technology-oriented network provider, 
we are also making progress towards becoming a service-
oriented experience provider. In this context, we carry out 
joint R&D programs and issue academic publications with

these activities,  in relation to the calculation 
methods of cost efficiencies enabled by 
technical solutions of these patents. In order 
to support the initiative of creating Standard-
Based Patents as part of our technological 
transformation goal, we play an active role 
in TÜSİAD Technological Standards and 
Standard-Based Patents Task Force.
We are a board member of ITEA4 
(International Technology Education 
Association) and CELTIC-NEXT communities 
within EUREKA (The European Audiovisual 
Observatory) to enable the firms and SMEs in 
our ecosystem to participate in international 
platforms. In projects that we participate 
With the guidance of the Ministry of Industry 
and Technology, we follow university and 
startup collaboration opportunities to expand 
Turkey’s R&D ecosystem, support startups 
and eventually increase the weight of 
domestic products and services. We provide 
technological support to startup companies 
and increase their communication and 
recognition by including them in the European 
Union projects that we are involved in.
As an example of our collaboration with 
startup companies, in 2021, we continue under the EUREKA umbrella, funding support 
is assessed by authorities of TÜBİTAK-TEYDEB 
(the Scientific and Technological Research 
Council of Turkey – Directorate of Technology 
and Innovation Support Programs). In recent 
years, we have successfully increased the 
number of project applications as part of 
the Horizon EUROPE main program and 
subprogram that derive direct and large grant 
support from the European Commission, on 
platforms offering a more competitive and 
selective environment for proposing project 
ideas.
to work with a technopark company to 
transfer real-time water analysis over NBIoT 
based communication modules This project 
enables remote analysis of drinking water 
resources in the event of a disaster or refugee 
influx. By integrating our 5G competencies 
to the hardware production capabilities of 
the startup company, we started to obtain 
prototypes of the work for this innovative 
and national product. We carry on our efforts 
around measuring the rate of sulphate in soil, 
a key parameter for soil fertility in particular.
Our human capital lies at the heart of 
our R&D and innovation strategies. In this 
respect, we provide academic development 
opportunities to Turkcell Technology 
researchers. Our postgraduate and doctorate 
programs, designed to improve the technical 
knowledge of our employees in accordance 
with the qualifications required by our sector, are ongoing since 2014 with a rapidly growing 
curriculum.
In the meantime, in accordance with our 
vision of leading the production of new 
technologies, we contributed to the expansion 
of technology studies by issuing 24 academic 
and 105 technical publications on national 
and international platforms in 2021.
Value created through the 
use of open-source
We prefer using open-source software as the building block 
of high-volume infrastructure applications such as ONEDESK, 
ULTIA, ONENT, YAP, PARS, which have been developed under 
the Turkcell GENS directorate. In this respect, in addition to 
creating value in terms of license management and cost 
initiatives, we support the future of the software world 
contributing to the development of high-quality secure 
software without any provider restrictions. In addition to the 
transfer of open source software used within Turkcell among 
teams and sharing of "know-how" thanks to the "Open 
Source Guild" we have created in Turkcell, we can make 
certain internally-developed added value codes available 
for external developers through "Jedi-Contributors" page 
we have built on "Github". This allows us to improve the 
motivation and market recognition of developers in Turkcell 
and help Turkcell become one of the leading companies in 
the realm of technology.The use of open source 
software is one of 
Turkcell's focal points 
both from a user and 
developer perspective. 
Open-source software is 
utilized to solve various 
problems in software 
architecture.

Digital services and 
solutions
All services we create call for diverse technical infrastructures, 
capabilities and specializations. We offer not only 
communication services, but also produce and develop digital 
services. Based on this strategy, we have developed a wide 
range of digital services domestically thanks to the more than 
1,000 engineers working for our Company. By establishing 
separate companies for some of these services, we have 
taken an important step towards their global competitive 
positioning. BiP, lifebox, TV + and fizy brands, which aim to 
stand out in the global competitive arena, are positioned as 
separate companies. As part of this structure, these brands 
conduct their activities faster, stronger, and with a greater 
focus within their own organizational structures.
We continue to lead the digital transformation 
need of society thanks to dozens of services 
including video conferencing, email services, instant 
messaging, TV, digital broadcasting, cloud storage, 
digital authentication, game services, and music 
platform, which have been developed by Turkish 
engineers and software developers. To make 
this digital transformation accessible, we use our 
advanced analytical capabilities, and position 
the right service for the right customer, thereby 
enhancing customer experience. Furthermore, we 
aim to contribute to localization in technology 
by developing these solutions. We design global 
brands and technologies, which we digitally export 
to the world while contributing to our country’s 
economy with self-sufficient technology solutions. 
Making these services, which create considerable 
employment for Turkish engineers, world-class 
brands and thus generating globally beneficial 
outputs through this achievement are among our 
major priorities. We consider it our primary goal 
to make a positive contribution to the national 
economy and reputation of our country by creating 
economic value through national security, data 
ownership, and by making use of our own data.While offering a richer 
value proposition to the 
lives of our users with 
our digital services and 
solutions, we keep on 
developing our portfolio 
by consistently and 
dynamically updating 
our products to address 
changing user needs. 
In 2021, we increased our digital services standalone revenues by 31%.
Communication without 
Boundaries: BiP
BiP was particularly popular during this process, both in 
Turkey and abroad, with its transparent privacy policy, 
secure technology, competitively superior features, and the 
experience it offers.
In January and February, the application ranked 1st in 12 
countries among the most downloaded applications in 
Android and iOS application stores for a long time and was 
one of the top 3 most popular applications in 19 countries. BiP 
became far and away the best application among rivals by 
getting a distinctively high score from users indicated by a 
satisfaction score of 4.6 on AppStore and 4.5 on Google Play.
We had over 20 million new users from many countries 
across the world, mainly including Indonesia, Bangladesh, 
India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Jamaica, Haiti, the Caribbean, 
Central America, and Asia-Pacific.
BiP, which enables uninterrupted communication for Turkcell, 
Türk Telekom, and Vodafone Pass users in Turkey without 
using their internet package, is preferred by millions across the 
globe and allows users to communicate seamlessly thanks to 
its superior technology. BiP differentiates itself from the global 
competition with features such as unsaved messaging, voice 
and video call up to 15 people, status, group and chat transfer, 
emergency button, fast and secure money transfer as fast as 
sending a message, and instant translation.BiP has approximately 
been downloaded over 
90 million times and 
used in 192 countries 
since its launch. 
Applications dictating 
sharing of personal 
data with third parties 
as of January increased 
concerns of personal 
data security, and 
the fact that this was 
coerced and imposed 
only in certain countries 
was noteworthy. 
As a result of this 
imposition, users started 
looking for alternative 
transparent and 
secure communication 
platforms.

Becoming increasingly popular in 
the gaming world, cloud gaming 
technology eliminates the need for 
powerful hardware for gaming. This 
technology is a game changer with 
its capability to transmit commands 
by users from their own devices 
to another powerful computer on 
servers and stream the feedback 
from this computer again to the user's 
device. With GAME+, playing the 
newest games becomes as easy and 
accessible as streaming video over the 
internet. Gaming no longer requires 
expensive hardware or large amounts 
of disk space.Dergilik, where hundreds 
of newspapers and 
magazines published 
in Turkey are delivered 
digitally on a single 
platform, enriches 
the magazine and 
newspaper reading 
experience, while 
facilitating the user

digital publications. 
Our new gaming brand 
GAME+ started delivering 
a brand-new experience 
in 2021 through servers 
in Turkey, as part of 
a collaboration with 
NVIDIA GEFORCE NOW, 
the most popular cloud 
gaming platform around 
the world. Environment-friendly and practical 
solutions through digitalization
The innovative solution developed by Turkcell 
engineers enables customers to accelerate the 
work of installation teams by 30% through the use 
of digital signature in their subscription processes 
of fiber, DSL, Superbox and TV+. This also leads to 11 
million pages of documents being digitalized annually, 
thereby protecting the environment. 1.5 million 
households are expected to use digital signatures 
annually across Turkey.
In addition to the solutions we offer to customers, we also employ a smart 
documentation solution for our own legal function which has an intensive paper 
usage. With this project, we have reduced manual transactions by digitizing 
(automatic assignment of 22,121 documents) the responses to legal document 
requests from the authorities and saved on paper usage. Thus, labor efficiency was 
achieved through prevention of errors while conducting tasks, and the automation of 
manually implemented assignments (25% speed/time saving) and query functions via 
robotic processes (IP queries 15% speed/time).Digital signature at home

support of SDGs. You may find more information 
on the artificial intelligence principles on the “digital 
responsibility” page of our website.
FOYA, another example of good practice 
developed by Turkcell engineers 
through artificial intelligence efforts, 
provides fraud detection in IDs and 
digital authentication with the use of 
image processing, voice processing, and 
machine learning.
While artificial intelligence technologies 
make it possible to detect anomalies 
and fraudulent cases in a number of 
documents such as identity cards, driving 
licenses, passports, temporary protection 
identification documents for foreign 
nationals; fake IDs can also be identified 
within seconds.
In today's digital world, many 
organizations need doing business 
through video calls with their customers. 
This has made customer authentication 
through digital platform an imperative Our Analytical Solutions team provides post-analysis and insights for Turkcell 
products, services, tariffs, and campaigns; and carry out predictive modelling and 
segmentation activities to create target audiences for business units. Supporting 
business units via analytical trend models to offer tariffs, products and services to the 
right customers, they contribute to revenue growth of our Company, and play a key 
role in increasing customer satisfaction.
We have incorporated proactive 
scenarios into our AI-based chatbot, 
which was developed by Turkcell 
engineers, in our Digital Operator 
application. This bot allows us to 
send personalized messages to 
our customers nearing, or have 
reached, the end of their contracts, 
or exceeding their current plan so 
that they can purchase the right 
package at the right time. Therefore, 
we can sell approximately 30 
thousand packages a month through 
the Digital Operator application. 
As a result of branding activities 
for our bot in the digital operator, 
we registered the name “celly” and 
branded our boat as Turkcell Celly. 
We had the opportunity to promote 
our virtual assistant including the 
name Celly and its visuals on 
digital channels by reaching large 
masses. Following these promotional 
activities, our daily number of bot 
users rose to around 200 thousand 
on average, our bot comprehension Our analytical solutions team

rates increased, and the percentage of 
customers not needing to call the call center 
after being serviced by the bot reached 
97.6%. 
Recently, we had the opportunity to integrate 
our chatbot solution in our DSS products in 
addition to the digital operator. Among our 
DSS products, BiP, Dergilik, Lifebox, Proov and 
GAME+ serve customers through our chatbots.
Trained through "UNDP Gender-Responsive 
Communication Guide", our chatbot avoids 
using gendered language.FOYAVoice analytics – Turkcell AI voice
We integrated our artificial intelligence 
voice into Dergilik and My Hidden Gem 
applications. We used humanlike voice 
to vocalize daily articles on Dergilik 
and words within "Communication and 
Speech Module" supporting speech 
development of children with autism in 
My Hidden Gem application. Additionally, 
online trainings developed by our 
Academy team are also vocalized by our 
artificial intelligence voice. 
In our call center, our artificial intelligence 
voice serves customers as the voice of 
the digital assistant at various points. 
By automatically vocalizing package 
readings with our AI voice when 
recommending customers packages 
through the call center, we contribute to 
offer the right package to our customers 
at the right time.  We improve our customer experience by responding to a 
daily number of 150 thousand call center 
voice requests on average. Turkcell

control. In digital authentication processes, FOYA uses 
face recognition services, gets voice approval from the 
customer, and performs remote identity check. 
The Near Field Communication (NFC) enables the 
transfer of credentials to mobile devices with a chip 
planted in ID cards. With the NFC solution of FOYA, 
users can perform authentication just by bringing 
their IDs near their mobile devices. Furthermore, the 
OCR solution of FOYA can read all details on the 
front and back face of IDs, allowing for checking 
name, last name, ID number, etc. of the person even 
with former IDs without the NFC feature. FOYA's 
"Speech to Text" service converts speech in user's 
video recording into text. After transcribed to text, 
user speech is checked, and, if verbally approved, this 
expression is automatically verified if appropriate. 
In digital authentication processes, FOYA verifies the 
person joining the video call live at the time of the 
call, and performs liveness check to prevent fraud, e.g. 
conducting transactions with video records.
Cyber security
At Turkcell, in order to maintain the security in the cyber world, 
we carry out activities on the national and international 
fronts to develop measures that help identify threats, and 
that reduce and eliminate the effects of possible attacks 
and incidents, and to share those measures with identified 
bodies. We ensure the security of information in accordance 
with business requirements, laws and legal regulations by 
means of our information security management systems 
under the supervision of our senior management. As part 
of these efforts, we became the first telecommunication 
operator in Turkey to receive ISO 27001 Information Security 
and Management System certification in 2008. We retain our 
certification by constantly improving our information security 
maturity and by being audited annually by independent 
auditors.
Cybersecurity plays an important role both in our internal 
activities and in providing products and services to our 
customers. We protect our corporate and private customers 
against cyber attacks through our diverse cybersecurity 
product portfolio, maturity of our processes, and competent 
human resources. 
We monitor attacks in our Security Operation Center 24/7 With the pandemic 
prevailing, remote 
work and distance 
education have become 
widespread in our 
country similar to the 
other parts of the 
world, IoT services and 
devices have started 
to be widely adopted, 
and cloud services 
and customers have 
skyrocketed, growing 
the importance of 
cybersecurity efforts.
SIMA is an API-based artificial intelligence platform that provides face analytics 
solutions. It contains a rich portfolio of features including face recognition, verification, 
age, gender, and emotion prediction.  Face detection and recognition algorithms 
were developed by Turkcell engineers working on authorized face images. The most 
appropriate combination of deep learning and machine learning algorithms is used, 
with that being the most up-to-date method.
In order to understand and meet our customers’ needs, we make use of the 
recommendation engine infrastructure developed by Turkcell engineers which targets 
to increase customized user experience in our applications and communication 
channels. We provide our customers with content such as suggestions, product 
similarities and personalized product lists in fizy, TV+ and Dergilik applications 
customized with the support of artificial intelligence.
Behind the recommendation engine is a very powerful and large data infrastructure, 
comprising a cluster of servers, which process over 200 million items of data per day. 
This large volume of data is processed by choosing the most appropriate algorithms 
specific to the subject/problem such as machine learning, deep learning, and 
collaborative filtering, and regularly feeds relevant applications at integration points.SIMA – Face analytics platform

We improve supply processes of entire 
Turkcell channels thanks to  our “Digital B2B 
Supply Platform” which could meet the 
procurement needs of multiple channels 
with a wider product and category 
range. Accelerating our processes and 
enhancing the experience with our 
Content Management Team, we continue 
to provide customized guidance to our 
dealers according to their orders and sales. Currently, we offer 41 thousand products of 
721 brands through 133 suppliers over the 
Turkcell Portal.
We continue organizing our campaigns 
"Yellow Days, Opportunity Garage, QR Code 
and This One or That One?" annually. This 
way, we aim to maintain our customer traffic 
at the highest level by making advantageous 
offers to our customers on a large number of 
product groups at different times.
As an ecosystem brand, we continue to launch new categories to address all 
electronic needs of our customers by transforming our Turkcell Stores into 
a technology store. Providing advantageous offers with installments up to 36 
months at Turkcell stores, we make small appliances, personal care products, food 
preparation appliances and gaming products available to our customers with 
Turkcell guarantee. In 2021, we launched our new "catalog sales model" through 
which we can make sale of big ticket products, which can be picked from digital 
catalogs of Turkcell stores by our customers, and deliver directly to the customer 
without keeping inventory and do the installation. 
As of July 2021, we started "Refurbished 
Device Sales" to bring devices with 
unexpired useful life back to the economy 
as per our sustainable environment 
approach. Since November 2021, we have 
been helping to decrease unregistered 
device sales and device imports by 
making refurbished devices available 
to our customers through cash and 
contracted offers via all Turkcell stores 
and the online channel, as well as 
mitigating the environmental impacts of 
device trade. We expect that this business, 
which we currently have only in the 
smartphone category, will be extended to 
various categories in the upcoming periods 
with supportive regulations to be introduced 
by relevant institutions, contributing to the 
sustainability approach in all categories 
across the technology world.We work to deliver superior quality services to our customers consistently across all 
our channels and continue to make a difference throughout our service and sales 
processes with our integrated channel experience solutions.  
In 2021, we started tracking the service experience of customers in an integrated 
manner via the "Customer contact journey" platform, which allows store and call center 
employees to view the transaction history of customers in all channels. As all of our 
channel employees can see this journey before serving the customers, they get familiar 
with customers' past experiences, which improves the customer satisfaction.
Extending the scope of the “Bi tıkla 
Mağazada (In-Store Delivery with a Click)” 
application launched in 2019 allowing 
delivery of devices purchased over Turkcell.

this service for new acquisition and  port-

from the Turkcell stores. For a unique and 
uninterrupted Turkcell experience, we give 
our customers the option to choose the 
channel.
We put in place our "Delivery Point" process enabling our customers, who have placed 
their orders through our Turkcell Pasaj and 
turkcell.com.tr online channel, to pick their 
ordered goods from Turkcell Stores in all 
of our qualifying stores across Turkey as of 
September 2021. The “Delivery Point” service 
is now available for customers at over 
1,200 stores across Turkey. Our customers 
don't need to wait for their packages at 
home thanks to our “Bi tıkla Mağazada 
Teslimat Noktası (In-Store Delivery with a

We have been carrying out social investment projects for a better world targeting 
children, women, people with disabilities, the elderly, refugees by utilizing the 
equalizing power of technology since our foundation.
In a period when social solidarity was more valuable than ever in the face of 
the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we created the "Digital Spring" 
technology rooms where elderly people living in nursing homes could experience 
technology, helping them hold on to life stronger. Thanks to Turkcell’s digital services, 
elderly people can watch TV, listen to music, video-call their relatives, and access to 
e-state service, play digital games and experience different parts of our country with 
VR sets. As part of the project, which we launched in March with the participation 
of the Minister of Family 
and Social Services, we 
completed our technology 
rooms at 5 nursing homes 
in Ankara and Istanbul in 
2021. We intend to maintain 
the sustainability of the 
project by adding new 
nursing homes each year. 
As part of Whiz Kids Project conducted by Turkcell in partnership with the Ministry of 
National Education, we intend to introduce gifted children in Turkey to technology and 
discover and develop their talents at an early age. In our Whiz Kids Technology Labs, 
we make facilities available to students including laptops, 3D printers, smart boards, 
electronic and robotic coding kits and toolsets, provide training in artificial intelligence, 
coding, space sciences, robotics, smart home and cloud technologies for children, 
and support them in developing projects in these areas. Shown by the IEEE among 
the exemplary services designed as per basic child rights principles, our Whiz Kids 
service is one of the 11 examples around the world. As part of the Whiz Kids Project, 
we reached 70 laboratories in total in 42 cities by establishing 11 new classes in 2021. 
In October, 25 new classrooms, whose inauguration was postponed due to the

After two people invented a robotic hand (mechanical hand) for a child born without 
fingers and shared their invention with those in need, robotic hand movement 
evolved gradually with contributions from many people around the world. It is a 
platform where affordable and usable robotic hand applications are shared after 
being created with 3D printers in dimensions and properties suitable for people who 
require a prosthetic hand. Our students aimed to create prosthetic hands using the 3D 
printers in Turkcell Whiz Kids classrooms to assist their friends who were born without 
hands.
As part of the project, a Robotic Hand training program for Whiz Kids students is 
carried out in collaboration with the Robotic Hand Association and is overseen by 
the Ministry of National Education. At the end of the training, our students from all 
over Turkey give the hands they have made to other students without hands. In the 
collaboration with the Robotic Hand Association, we provide assistance to all children 
waiting for a hand.
Zekathon is an event organized as part of the Turkcell Whiz Kids project in

We began supporting our mentally disabled students in sports through the Sports 
Without Boundaries program, which we launched in 2020. In 2021, approximately 
5,000 disabled students used the rooms we built in 11 schools.
As part of our Sports Without Boundaries Project, we developed an educational 
program to assist athletes with disabilities during the pandemic period in 2021. We 
prepared an accessible sports training program for disadvantaged individuals who 
remained indoors under full lockdown during Disability Week, which ran from May 
10 to May 16. The content created to address the sports needs of individuals with 
disabilities who were staying at home during the pandemic period included a variety 
of educational materials for each disability group. As part of the remote education 
program which consist of 40 videos, the content created to address the specific 
needs of individuals with visual, hearing, and physical disabilities, as well as children 
with autism, was 
made available 
on the Turkcell 
Academy without 
Boundaries and 
Turkcell YouTube 
channel.
As part of the 
project, we 
reached nearly 
10,000 people with 
physical disabilities, 
which received 
extensive press 
coverage and on 
the digital media.
TV+ provides subtitles, sign language, and audio 
description options for movies in order to allow viewers 
with visual and hearing disabilities to use the platform 
equally. Over 20 movies adapted for viewing by 
people with disabilities are available on channel 555, in 
Plus movie theaters, and in the TV+ category "Movies 
Clearing Obstacles."
As the project progresses, we hope to expand the 
content with audio description and sign language.Sports Without Boundaries

Recycle into Education
The entire revenue from recycling is 
donated to the TEGV (Education Volunteers 
Foundation of Turkey) to be used for 
providing high-quality education to children.
Turkcell has recycled 8.5 tons in 2021 and a 
total of 15 tons of electronic waste since the 
project's beginning in November 2019. Initially, 
all proceedings of the project were donated 
to TEGV (Education Volunteers Foundation 
of Turkey) to be used for children's qualified 
education. Due to the pandemic, donations 
were made to the children of healthcare 
professionals who died in 2020 and 2021 
through KAHEV (Female Doctors Eductation 
Foundation). It is planned to donate to TEGV 
again in 2022 for the qualified education of 
children. With the Recycle to 
Education project, techno 
waste (mobile phones, 
PCs, tablets, accessories, 
etc.) collected in recycling 
containers at Turkcell stores 
are recycled in partnership 
with the Informatics Industry 
Association (TÜBİSAD), the 
organization authorized to 
recycle waste.
In addition to the social value we created 
through the Recycle into Education Project, 
we contribute to our natural capital. You can

In accurately introducing Turkcell to our investors, and 
analyzing our business model, risks and opportunities, we aim 
to establish a transparent and proactive investor relations 
management with a focus on making a difference by 
mastering Turkcell strategies and effectively communicating 
them to investors.
In our Turkey and international activities, to make our supply 
network as agile, flexible, and sustainable as our direct 
operations, we restructure our main business processes, 
logistics and technologies with a holistic approach, supported 
by our suppliers.
We sign a framework agreement with every firm we work 
with in our supply chain and ensure the seamless delivery of 
our ethical, fair, and honest business practices through our 
policies and contracts. In this agreement, we are committed 
to compliance with our principles, including avoiding child 
labor and employment for collection of employee debts. 
Within the scope of the child labor clause in our framework 
agreement, there is a rule stating that “The company should 
not use child labor”. To this end, we participated in Action 
Pledges to eliminate child 
labor as per Alliance 
8.7. Unless a higher age 
limit is specified in local 
laws, we ensure that our 
suppliers implement the 
rule “No one under the 
age of 15 who has not 
completed compulsory 
education (within the 
scope of International 
Labor Organization (ILO) As part of Turkcell 
Investor Relations, we list 
our fundamental working 
principles as accessibility, 
rapid feedback to 
stakeholders, and the 
transparent, consistent 
and timely information 
provision.
As sustainable supply 
chain increases 
competitiveness of 
corporates and enables 
effective management 
of business models, the 
number of organizations 
adopting this way 
of working is rapidly 
increasing. Within the 
framework of our value 
creation principle, as 
Turkcell, we evaluate 
each stage in our supply 
chain management 
starting from the 
materials we use, 
including the activities 
and practices of each 
company in our supply 
chain.You can find more information on Turkcell’s transparent and

Value-driven, responsible supply 
chain management As Turkcell, we offer services touching every moment 
of human life directly. Partnering with suppliers that will 
avoid potential service disruptions likely to affect the vital 
needs of the society such as communication, healthcare 
and security is paramount in delivering our products 
and services to our customers. We determine all the 
suppliers we work with on the basis of mutual trust, along 
with distinctive features such as quality-price balance, 
past performance, market conditions, and references. 
While we carry out our evaluation, we prioritize supplier 
candidates with quality management and information 
security management certification, who are sensitive to 
the ecological balance, and who work within the scope of 
social responsibility principles, together with other basic criteria.
We classify our purchase categories based on the Kraljic Matrix. Based on this classification, 
we evaluate our suppliers, who have a purchase volume above a certain threshold, with 
respect to service quality, and commercial as well as 
operational processes. In line with our value-driven and 
responsible supply chain practices, we execute complaint 
processes and ensure remedial actions are immediately 
taken according to the framework of the agreement 
and considering feedback from general customer 
communication channels or business functions and 
results from surveys of business owners and purchasing 
departments. Through regular assessments and audits we 
carry out, we evaluate the compliance of our suppliers 
and report them to our senior management. We proudly 
announce that in 2021 there were no cases indicating that SDG 16.5 SDG  8.8 SDG  8.7 SDG 16.6convention No. 138) ought to be employed. 
Employees below the age of 18 should not be 
employed in jobs that pose danger, or in night 
shift jobs in order to meet their educational 
needs”. We also ensure the ethical 
management of our business processes in 
line with the rule that “No employees ought 
to be forced to work in any situation. This 
requirement includes the forced prison labor, 
labor in exchange of debt with high interest, 
or other forms of forced labor” clause to 
prevent forced labor. Should any supplier 
violate the framework agreement and fail to 
comply with the requirements of the clauses, we act according to the relevant legal clause.
We expect our supplier ecosystem to 
maintain all their employer-employee 
relations by respecting employee rights 
with a management approach sensitive 
to environment and people as part of our 
Code of Ethics and our Policy of Combatting 
Bribery and Corruption as published on the 
Turkcell Supplier Portal. In addition, we have 
all of the suppliers we cooperate approve

our supply chain and suppliers had caused a 
negative environmental or social impact, or 
else could have a potentially negative one.
As Turkcell Group, we keep in mind ethical 
principles, fight against corruption and 
social contribution, and do business 
with a transparent attitude towards our stakeholders, in all processes of our 
purchasing management structure, evaluated 
under four categories of strategy, people, 
process and implementation. National and 
international standards are our compass in 
making our purchasing processes completely 
transparent. 
In managing our purchasing processes, we embrace cost 
analysis and dynamic working principles and prioritize 
practices that will deliver savings through the integrating 
power of technology in evaluating the processes.
By creating material requirement plans of our network 
for the entire year, we ship the right amount of material 
at the right time to our regions based on the needs of 
the site leveraging our regional store organization and 
the "push" principle. This allows us to avoid redundant 
and surplus demand, minimizing purchasing, logistic and 
stocking costs. Additionally, by defining product width, 
length and height measurements for our e-commerce 
products at the time of the acceptance of goods, we 
ensure that the system picks the box that best fits the product dimensions at the time of 
packaging. While our smallest box used to be SIZE 3 beforehand, we now have smaller SIZE 
1 boxes to be used to ship our mobile phones, wired and wireless headsets, etc. This allows 
us to use smaller-volume boxes for our shipments, cutting down the amount of paper used 
and increasing the volume of products that can be shipped in one go, consequently reducing 
logistic efforts. Our boxes are produced from 100% recyclable material.We conduct our purchasing processes in accordance with the following rules 
and standards:
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
Security Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulations
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)

Liabilities regarding other countries that we operate in (Ukraine, Belarus, TRNC)We position the value-driven processes we operate with our suppliers under a single 
team for rapid implementation. With our Innovation and Ecosystem Relations Process 
Management team positioned under the Supply Chain Process Development team, we 
carry out localization efforts, SME and startup support programs, collaborations through 
international and local sector-specific organizations, supplier-driven innovation efforts, 
supplier diversity and development, and risk and sustainability analysis efforts. 
We support domestic and national technological transformation to promote 
entrepreneurship activities in Turkey so that they will contribute to sustainability. 
Accordingly, we carry out category localization activities, supplier relations, technopark 
relations and entrepreneurship support programs (My Principal Partner Program), 
activities to attract global investment to Turkey, Commercial Attaché affairs, and 
coordination of all internal stakeholders. We believe localization efforts are critical for 
Turkcell as it is directly related to our relations with the local ecosystem and the ICTA. 
As part of the "Turkcell Localization Initiative", we identified the main categories with 
a localization potential to be tracked in short, medium and long term, and started 
designing localization methodologies for these categories together with teams 
consisting of request owners and purchasing experts.
We are engaged in project development activities with manufacturers to support our 
producers in our localization efforts. As a result of our collaboration with BOREAS, we 
enable local production of data center cooling systems with precision control, which 
we imported, with lower cost. We continuously work to increase the percentage of 
domestically-produced goods, which reached 75% in the European Data Center project. Supplier ecosystem management

Our localization framework ensures that purchased products are produced 
in Turkey and purchased services are delivered by a local workforce. The 
localization rate of our main suppliers, which corresponds to approximately 
90% of our total purchase volume, has been realized at 45.4% in 2021. 
We continue supporting the promotion of startups by visiting 
technoparks following our new procurement model developed in 2020 
for assisting startups. With My Principal Partner Program developed with 
this purpose in mind, we  made a business agreement with 41 enterprises 
and generated a trade volume of TRY 21.6 million with 35 companies 
affiliated with 20 technoparks in 12 cities by the end of 2021. 
With contribution from relevant business functions and procurement managers, we 
turn innovative ideas submitted by our suppliers into projects as part of the Supplier-
oriented Innovation Program we launched in 2020 to encourage innovations across 
the supplier ecosystem. Projects are submitted to the "Supplier-oriented Innovation and 
Localization" committee consisting of the jury of Turkcell Assistant General Managers, 
with a presentation including potential contributions of the project like extra savings, 
process and quality improvement, revenue potential and sustainability, and successful 
projects are implemented. By partnering with suppliers that submit innovative ideas in 
this program, we create advantages for the industry as well as suppliers and Turkcell. 
Examples to projects approved by the committee are as follows: use of solar panels 
for the energy requirement of field equipment, production of lower-cost composite 
manholes with a reduced occupational safety risk for optical fiber boxes, development 
of nano-trenchers increasing operational efficiency with shorter excavation sections 
and causing less inconvenience, use of mobile caravans instead of mobile vehicles for 
supporting regions for uninterrupted communication, and installation of mobile visit 
systems in hospitals to facilitate the communication 
of patients and patient relatives. These projects 
allow for labor safety and efficiency, additional 
revenue stream opportunities, and the development 
of processes sensitive to the environment and 
people. As of the end of 2021, 67 ideas were 
evaluated, 13 were escalated to the committee, and 
10 were approved and implemented. These projects 
are targeted to make a potential contribution of TRY 
165.3 million in a period of 5 years including savings 
and revenues.
As part of the Supplier-oriented Innovation Project, 
we developed nano trenchers which can carry out 
shorter-section excavations to be able to serve Supplier-oriented Innovation Projectsat high-cost locations such as villa complexes, industrial zones and internal areas of 
housing estates. Using these vehicles, we aim to carry out excavations with higher 
operational efficiency with 67% lower cost and cause the least harm possible to the 
environment through the system collecting excavated soil in the vehicle storage area.
With our social capital that shape the way we 
do business, we realize the vision and mission 
underpinning our various capitals through our 
statements such as “Turkey’s data should remain in 
Turkey”, “Turkey’s robust infrastructure”, and “Mobile 
internet at Fiber Speed”. We support our robust 
financial capital through high customer satisfaction 
and loyalty. And with the awareness of being a 
good corporate citizen, our solid relations with 
employees, the public, our suppliers and our society 
form the cornerstone of our Turkcell identity, which

We plan the use of our natural capital by considering the balance of the 
natural ecosystem and the needs of future generations, aiming at the effective 
management of our environmental performance. We take various initiatives to 
reduce the environmental impact of our operational activities while improving our 
business processes in accordance with sustainable innovation principles. We include 
our employees and their families, suppliers, investors, and customers in this process.
Turkcell purchased carbon credits to offset carbon emissions caused due to printing 
of its 2021 integrated annual report.As Turkcell, we focus on understanding, managing and 
reducing the impacts we cause in the management of our 
natural capital in our operations. We strive to sustainably 
manage our operations, increase efficiency and maximize 
the value that comes from our natural capital. Accordingly, 
we comply with the respective requirements of  all national 
environmental regulations. In 2021, there were no filings 
against Turkcell by regulatory and supervisory bodies with 
respect to legislative misconducts, or complaints in relation to 
environmental issues.By integrating our 
sustainability strategy 
to Turkcell's business 
model, we are trying to 
transform our natural 
resources into social and 
economic value, and 
with this transformation, 
we are trying to 
achieve zero negative 
environmental impact 
and increase our positive 
impact. In 2021, we organized prized competitions among our 
employees so as to further increase awareness of 
sustainability. We provide incentives and offer training 
programs to our employees regarding the sustainable 
development of the way they carry out their business 
activities. In 2021, everyone across our organization including 
our CEO was appointed with KPIs related to sustainability. 
These strategic sustainability goals based on ESG have been 
added among our business goals for 2021 and they will 
continue to be updated each year. Within this framework, 
employees' performances are measured by creating a 
methodology based on ESG parameters.
In parallel to increased environmental obligations as a 
consequence of the climate crisis, Turkcell started to 
include its indirect environmental impact on various national 
and international reports (such as ISO 14064 Green Gas 
Calculation and Verification Management System - CDP 
Climate Change Report) while disclosing the processes on 
which it has environmental impact, and develops relevant 
projects and best practices. We have developed various 
projects in relation to electronic waste of our customers 
as well as waste created by our employees. In addition to 
Category 1 and Category 2 emissions driven by our business 
activities and energy use, we have also started to measure 
our Category 3, Category 4, Category 5 and Category 6

In this regard, as the first mobile operator in Turkey having 
ISO 14064 Corporate Greenhouse Gas Emissions Calculation

responsibilities. In the previous years, we used to evaluate 
emissions caused by our activities in terms of Category 1, 
Category 2, and Category 3, Category 4, Category 5 and 
Category 6 but as we switched to the 2018 version of the 
standard, we calculated 2021 emissions as "Direct" and 
"Indirect". We monitor our green gas emissions including CO2, 
CH4, N2O,HFC, PFC, SF6 and NF3 gases by making necessary 
measurements through the IPCC Tier 1 and Tier 2 (electricity) 
approach. In our ISO 14064 Calculation and Reporting of

personnel shuttles within the scope of our direct and indirect 
energy consumption and other indirect emissions, as well as 
waste generated, transmission and distribution losses in the

arising from the production of energy that we consume.

of our greenhouse gas 
emissions generated 
as a result of our 
business activities, use of 
resources and services 
we have provided 
are among our main 
environmental priorities. 
As we report our emissions, we get external and independent audit services in line with ISO 
14064 rules and report direct and energy indirect green gas emissions accordingly. 
Additionally, in line with the Carbon Disclosure Project, we have been sharing the reports on 
our emissions transparently with stakeholders since 2014 in the form of CDP Climate Change 
Report. Our base year for greenhouse gas emission calculation is determined as 2016 in terms 
of data completeness and appropriateness of scope. It is determined that 2016 was the 
most appropriate year for Turkcell, where direct and indirect emissions are comprehensively 
monitored, and where data is compliant with the standards’ requirements and completeness 
principle. There is no activity related to the burning of biomass within our operational 
boundary.319 318 2VALUE CREATING

Total Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions (t CO2e)* 
The Turkcell greenhouse gas emissions intensity ratio for 2021, including Direct and 
Energy Indirect Emissions was calculated as 110.678 ton CO2e/Petabyte. The intensity 
metric for GHG emissions intensity is defined as “2021 Turkcell Turkey’s emission per 
petabyte”. Electricity consumption per 1 MB is 0.0002 kWh.With Dergilik, which is one of the applications where we contribute positively to 
the environment, we provide the opportunity to read magazines and newspapers 
digitally on a single platform. The number of newspaper and magazine downloads 
through this app in 2021 was 23 million. Based on the number of pages of an 
average publication, the total number of pages accessed by these downloads 
was 1.6 billion. Thus, in 2021, Dergilik users preserved close to 103 thousand trees, 
supporting the reduction of carbon emissions. Thanks to the positive impact we 
make on the environment through our Dergilik application, we believe that the 
penetration of digital publishing will increase day by day. 
Turkcell Kopilot application, which offers a new dimension to the car driving 
experience with superior features, indirectly leads to reduction in gas 
consumption through the analysis of gas usage, the route and the driver. Thanks 
to this application, we help companies manage their vehicle fleets with an 
environmentally-friendly approach.We also take innovative steps in sustainable 
finance. The maturity of the “Sustainability 
Indexed Loan” obtained by the agreement 
we signed with BNP Paribas has been 
extended from 2022 to 2026. The principal 
amount of the loan has been increased from 
We developed a biometric signature practice for 
contracts signed with landlords as part of the field rental 
process in order to decrease the resource usage and its 
negative environmental impacts. We adopted a digital 
contract management system allowing end-to-end 
digital data entry instead of a process based on physical 
exchange of contracts, which reduced the number of 
required steps from 13 to 5. We can now complete the 
field rental process, which previously took 3-10 days, in 
a single day. With the adoption of this new practice, to 
date 2,515 contracts have been signed with biometric 
signature, thus leading to savings on paper consumption, EUR50 million EUR70 million, which led to 
EUR20 million additional financing. With the 
utilization of sustainable loans, we fulfill our 
environmental responsibilities while reducing 
our financing costs. 
You may find the details of our sustainable financing activities in the financial 
capital section of the report.

We have an objective of reducing the CO2 
emission by approximately 960 tons by 
preferring hybrid vehicles for our fleet and 
hence lowering the CO2 emission by 35-40 
gr per kilometer. In accordance with this 
objective, we have switched 677 of our fossil-
diesel vehicles with hybrid ones in 2021. In 
2020, our emission measurement was 12.7 
gr/km and this year it was lowered to 9.1 gr/
km resulting in a reduction of our carbon emissions by 25%.
With the responsibility of being a pioneer and 
exemplary brand, we define our sustainability 
strategies and goals, climate change 
scenarios by taking SDGs into account. 
Reflecting our goal of becoming a carbon 
neutral company by 2050, we determine 
carbon price based on offers collected from 
our solution partners in the market to offset 
the emissions from our operations. 
Water management
We do not use water resources directly in developing 
products and services. Nevertheless, since we are a 
responsible company in terms of the use of resources, we 
announce our water consumption in our annual reports.
The daily water use of our employees in the locations at 
which we operate comprises our fundamental water need 
within our activities. In our data centers, we reuse rainwater 
as gray water (in toilets and urinals) with various filtering 
processes. We continue our efforts to recycle and reuse our 
wastewater.We deem water as 
the most important 
natural and vital 
resource. Therefore, our 
responsible corporate 
citizenship makes 
us place emphasis 
on the responsible 
consumption of water in 
our activities. We take 
measures to reduce 
water consumption in 
order to make sure that 
water usage, which we 
consider to be among 
the critical environmental 
responsibilities, is 
managed sustainably. While focusing on reducing water consumption of our activities and recycling 
it, we also try to support our customers in improving their water consumption 
through the services we provide. Our Smart Water Meter solution, which allows 
meters to be read and valves to be opened/closed remotely leveraging IoT 
technologies, helps control water consumption, enabling instant monitoring of 
water use and protection of natural resources. 
We offer our “Filiz” application to 
farmers in order to protect scarce 
water resources and support 
sustainable agricultural activities which 
is a field where water consumption is 
high. Turkcell Filiz communicates critical 
information such as requirements for 
plant development, water need and 
disease risk to farmers, enabling them 
to take necessary measures. Turkcell 
Filiz collects this data by monitoring 
various soil and air parameters through 
sensors and incorporating them into 
algorithms created with artificial intelligence. Most of the farmers in 
Turkey lack access to technical support 
and "Filiz” is also noteworthy for its 
ability to reach agricultural engineers 
through digital channels. In this 
regard, we enable access to technical 
information for those who need it, 
through digital channels. Integrating 
these capabilities with technology, we 
support sustainable agriculture.323 322 2VALUE CREATING

Waste management
In line with our waste management approach, we use 
systems that reduce waste generation and the use of natural 
resources in our operations. Furthermore, we sort waste, 
which we cannot prevent, at its source and recycle.
Although we do not create huge amount of waste as a 
company in the digital industry, we develop practices to 
reduce the consumption of materials such as paper and toner 
in our office buildings and sort all types of waste such as 
paper, plastic, and domestic waste at their source. We send 
sorted waste to recycling facilities as part of our cooperation 
with municipalities and respective authorities where our 
company buildings are located.
We collect batteries in waste battery containers and 
deliver them to municipalities and TAP (Portable Battery 
Manufacturers and Importers Association) for recycling.
As part of Turkey’s Zero Waste Project launched nationwide, 
we have been carrying out activities since 2018 in line 
with this project's objectives. Having established a Waste 
Management Center at our headquarters, solid food waste 
collected from our cafeteria and office floors is recycled by 
the compost machine and turned into organic soil fertilizer. 
We are proud to be the first company in Turkey to have 
implemented Zero Waste Project, even though we don’t 
engage in manufacturing activities.Having adopted the 
approach of generating 
minimum waste and 
maximum recycling, we 
manage waste resulting 
from our operations and 
activities by selecting 
appropriate methods 
and technologies, and 
conduct our processes 
in full compliance with 
relevant regulations 
through our contracted 
waste management 
company. As a result of 
our efforts in this field, 
we have received the 
Basic Level ZERO WASTE 
certificate on October 18, 
2021
SDG 12.2We dispose of hazardous waste such as 
batteries, toner, electronics, cables, and 
consumables resulting from our operations 
through licensed recycling companies which 
have the required competency within the 
respective regulatory framework. Thus, we 
prevent hazardous waste from interacting 
with the environment. On the other hand, 
in order to prevent waste oil generated 
in our offices from mixing with domestic 
wastewater, we use oil trap systems.
By selling second hand and scrap material 
to companies which use outdated 
technology, we make sure the products 
are reused. We aim to revalue 100% of 
network infrastructure devices as part of 
such sales. Hence, we contribute to the 
circular economy system, which ensures that 
resources are not redundantly extracted or 
wasted, but recovered for reuse. As part of 
the Modem Renewal Project launched in 
2019, we renew or repair modems no longer 
used by customers and offer them to be 
reused by our customers in need of these 
products. Within the scope of this project, 121 SDG 12.2thousand set top boxes (STB), 155 thousand 
Superbox products, 125 thousand optical 
network terminals (ONT) and 457 thousand 
modems were renewed in 2021. 36%  of the 
approximately 682 thousand fiber modems 
(approximately 250 thousand) and 53% ofthe 
ADSL modems (approximately 150 thousand)  
used in 2021 were sourced from modems 
renewed during the year. In addition, 95% 
of the renewed STBs, 100% of the ONTs (as 
ONTs are installed upon determination of the 
usability) and 36% of the Superboxes were 
used in the same year and brought into the 
service of our customers.*Hazardous Waste

We are well aware of the adverse 
ecosystem-related impacts of electronic 
waste composed of electronic products 
which haven't completed their lifespan due 
to improper management. Hence, we carry 
out our activities in this field with the utmost 
care. In order to convert this situation into 
opportunity, we utilize products classified 
as electronic waste, yet that include rich 
raw materials and materials suitable for 
reuse, as part of circular economy, thereby 
achieving financial savings and efficient use 
of limited resources.
We have continued our activities as part of the “Recycle into Education” project, which is 
an electronic waste recycling campaign in Turkey, started in cooperation with “TÜBİSAD 
(Informatics Industry Association)”. 
You may find information about the social benefit we create through our Recycle into 
Education project in our social capital chapter.As part of our 
environmentally-
friendly business 
model based on 
shaping technology 
according to social 
needs, we prioritize 
the consumption of 
renewable energy 
to ensure optimum 
use of natural resources. As the first mobile operator which 
have obtained the ISO 50001 Energy Management System 
Standard in Turkey, we save on the energy we consumed. 
We established Turkcell Energy Solutions in 2017 in order to 
supply low-cost and environmentally-friendly energy. We aim 
to become a consistent and transparent electricity energy 
supplier that operates within the boundaries of private law in 
the competitive environment. Accordingly, we aim to create With the environmentally-friendly 
invoice subscription, which we 
established through the Telesales 
channel, we reduce our printing and 
delivery costs, while significantly 
reducing our paper consumption and 
negative environmental impact.
We carry out all transactions from 
new subscription to tariff changes, and 
from buying a new SIM card to settling 
invoices at Turkcell stores with a digital 
signature on a tablet in just seconds. 
Digital signature also makes it possible 
to subscribe to services that require 
at-home installation for our customers 
such as DSL, Superbox and TV+. We 
expect to reduce paper consumption by 30% while digitizing approximately 
11 million pages of documents annually 
with digital signature. Meanwhile, we 
enable companies from all industries to 
use the digital signature service.
The smart legal document automation 
solution, which we developed for our 
legal department that traditionally 
sees high paper consumption, helps 
reduce paper use and manual processes 
through robotic process automation. 
Accordingly, we reduce error risk, while 
becoming more environmentally-
friendly and operating a more effective 
system.
Energy management
Turkcell sees energy 
management as one 
of the most critical 
factors in our industry. 
We address our energy 
management practices 
in two perspectives; the 
energy we consume as 
part of our activities and 
the energy we produce 
from renewable sources.

value by leveraging the increased synergy 
and efficiency arising from the bundling 
of energy, energy solutions, and mobile 
and fixed benefits through an integrated 
approach. Energy crisis, which is one of the 
most challenging issues, is on our agenda and 
we closely monitor various factors that could 
affect the market such as developments in 
the European electric industry, Carbon Border 
Adjustment Mechanism and Paris Agreement.
We calculate and monitor our energy 
As part of our goal of becoming carbon 
neutral by 2050 as a company which 
consumes 100% renewable energy and 
generates renewable energy, we pioneer 
renewable energy investments by employing 
the self-consumption model in our buildings. 
We therefore target becoming a company performance using an energy intensity 
performance indicator defined as the ratio 
of non-renewable energy consumption to 
revenue. The Turkcell Energy Intensity ratio for 
2021, including our total energy consumption, 
is calculated as 867.7 GJ/ Petabyte. The 
specific measurement unit we used in 
the Turkcell energy intensity calculation is 
identified as “2021 Turkcell Turkey emission 
generated per petabyte used.”
that supplies and generates its electricity 
from environmentally friendly resources. In line 
with this goal, we plan to meet our energy 
requirements from green energy sources by 
having power plants of our own and leasing 
renewable energy generation capacity from 
power plants in Turkey. We are not only a firm that consumes renewable energy but we also produce 
renewable energy. 
SDG 7.2 SDG 13.1
As Turkcell Energy Solutions, we prioritize saving energy 
and implementing the use of renewable energy for our 
activities. Accordingly, as Turkcell Energy Solutions, we 
approach energy consumption and generation from an 
environmentalist perspective by installing solar energy 
power plants at our data centers and offices, and reducing 
the carbon emission within the self-consumption model 
framework. In 2021, the electricity we generated by the 
self-consumption model reached an amount equivalent 
to the 1-year electricity consumption of 410 households. 
Furthermore, we encourage environmentally-friendly 
methods through electricity trade with renewable energy 
power plants. We continue our environmentally-friendly 
approach with our renewable energy supply that is 
certificated with IREC in 2021.
Turkcell Energy Solutions aims to make Turkcell a company 
that supplies its electricity from environmentally-friendly 
sources with zero carbon emissions and continues its 
renewable energy investments for the coming periods.
Turkcell Energy acquired Karadag Wind Energy Power 
Plant of 18 MW which is located at Cesme and owned 
by Boyut Grup Enerji with a share transfer agreement 
signed in August 2021. Our Karadağ Wind Energy Power 
Plant produces 71.83 million kWh of electricity per year 
and provides for the annual energy needs of 2,500 base 
stations. Thanks to the clean energy supply provided 
to Turkcell's network, we prevent the emission of 32.4 
thousand tons of CO2 to the atmosphere each year. We 
have certified entire electricity consumption of Turkcell 
Group in YEK-G market with 100% rate. Therefore, as a 
Company having 100% consumption from renewables, 
we continue to be a pioneer in Turkey. With 100% YEK-G 
certificate, we support renewable energy producers and continue to be an exemplary 
company in sustainability efforts in Turkey. Furthermore, we aim to increase the capacity of 
our power plant in 2022 so that we increase the supply of clean energy. We have applied to 
acquire I-REC certification which will allow reporting the renewable energy production and 
consumption for our power plant to be valid as of 2021. In addition to this, by exporting I-REC 
certificates we provide opportunities for our customers and our Group to report their green 
energy consumption in accordance with the international reporting standards hence creating 
additional financial contribution. 
With our Group’s first solar power plant, located in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, we 
generate 1.5 million kWh of electricity annually. With this plant, we also reduce the demand 
load on the TRNC Turkish Electricity Authority in Cyprus (KIB-TEK) network and contribute to 
its digital infrastructure. And thanks to this power plant, we prevent the emission of 676 tons of 
CO2 to the atmosphere.
Ankara Data Center is the first data center in Turkey which produces its own electricity 
through solar panels. We benefit from solar power through new generation panels installed 
on top of our headquarter building’s parking lot, meeting part of our electricity demand 
from renewable sources. We avoided 171.34 tons of CO2e emissions via our data center 
building that generates 380 thousand kWh of electricity a year. We are proud to be Turkey’s 
only company to have two data centers which have obtained Uptime OS Operational 
Sustainability Gold certification. Our Gebze Data Center was the first in Turkey to receive the 
certificate in 2018 and this was followed by our Ankara Data Center.
Moreover, we generate electricity 
from renewable resources through 
a solar energy scheme installed 
on the roof of the Turkcell Adana 
Plaza building. We utilize the 
energy generated through the 
self-consumption model to meet 
the electricity needs of our Adana 
Plaza building. We avoid around 
31.7 tons of CO2 of greenhouse gas 
emissions annually through the 
production of 70.3 thousand kWh 
electricity.

We generated 2,200 MWh electricity from renewables with 5 solar power projects 
in 2021. In 2021, we acquired İzmir Karadağ Wind Power Plant. This plant has an 
installed power of 18MW and a production capacity of 67,500MWh meeting the 
electricitiy consumption of 2,500 base stations.
Portable Solar Field solution, one of our 
innovative solutions, meet communication 
needs in regions where the population 
increases seasonally, but where access 
to energy resources is limited. These 
communication stations, installed in various 
locations across Turkey, stand out for their 
environmentally-friendly features and 
contribute to our sustainability goals. We 
are proud to share that our investments into 
renewable energy technologies will continue 
in the upcoming periods.
We design our processes to minimize 
the environmental impact not only in our 
direct operations, but throughout our entire 
value chain. In accordance with our green 
procurement practices, we evaluate the 
compliance of products we use to various 
environmental criteria such as energy 
efficiency and the sustainability of raw 
materials, and prioritize the use of products 
with low negative environmental impacts. 
In line with these practices, we set the 
Eco-design criteria and current regulations, 
which is not yet an obligation in Turkey, as 
prerequisite to be met in air conditioning 
equipment we use in our projects. We thereby 
aim to increase energy efficiency by using 
products of A energy-class.
As Turkcell, we set short and long-term 
goals to reduce negative environmental 
impact, carrying out reporting and activities 
accordingly. Within this context, in 2021, Key 
Performance Indicators for renewable energy and techno waste have been determined 
as a business target for the relevant teams. 
Additionally, preparations on the compliance 
process of suppliers with the Environmental 
and Human Rights Policies published by 
Turkcell have begun in 2021. We also defined 
compliance of Turkcell's with ESG procedures 
as a business goal.
We carry out energy saving activities to 
ensure responsible use of our existing energy 
resources. We attach importance to the 
energy efficiency of our network equipment. 
We save energy thanks to air conditioning 
devices and energy infrastructure in data 
center system rooms with more efficient, 
state-of-the-art products. In calculating 
our energy savings, we consider the 
approximate annual savings of each field 
in which saving initiatives are implemented, 
and calculate annual savings by taking the 
total number of such fields into account. And 
in pursuit of achieving energy savings, we 
leverage practices such as fields without air 
conditioning, efficient rectifier technology, 
passive cooling, outdoor cabinets, power 
saving algorithms, renewable energy and 
GPON technology. Furthermore, in order to 
save energy, we design our buildings in a way 
we could utilize day light at a maximum level. 
We use less energy in heating and cooling 
our facilities with the help of heat insulation 
materials we use on walls and exterior 
cladding.
SDG 7.3We believe sustainable development can be achieved 
through circular economy which is a method that 
could reduce the use of resources. Hence, we develop 
our long-term intellectual capital by taking natural 
resources into consideration. We additionally make 
sure that social programs are carried out. We use our 
technological competencies to produce environmentally 
friendly solutions and provide sustainable services to our 
customers.
The interaction of our natural 
capital with our other capitals
Our natural resources 
which are limited in 
supply are crucial in 
terms of our sustainable 
growth mission. We 
cover the effects of our 
use of natural resources 
through sustainable and 
green financing solutions 
in our financial capital.331 330ABOUT

Announcement Regarding the Announcements in relation to our Companyby taking the requests, suggestions and recommendations of all our stakeholders into 
consideration, following the date of February 17, 2022 on which our financial results will be 
disclosed, 
2. for their request under article 10 and its sub-paragraph of the Resolution Draft Enclosed 
to the Notification as to dismissal and replacement of Board members, that among the four 
Board members whose replacement was requested; the three Board members who had been 
nominated in accordance with capital markets legislation and upon obtaining the approval 
of Capital Markets Board and Julian Michael Sir Julian Horn-Smith who served at group of 
companies which IMTIS is a part of as a Board member for numerous years, were elected for 
a term of 3 years with the affirmative vote of IMTIS at the Annual General Assembly dated 
April 15, 2021; that no developments have occurred which would impair the independence of 
the three independent Board members; that there also have not been any developments that 
would legally hinder Julian Michael Sir Julian Horn-Smith to continue his Board membership; and 
that based on such dismissal of the relevant Board members without any valid grounds before 
their term of office may trigger compensation claims and may pose a potential risk of damage 
to our Company’s stakeholders, 
3. for their request under article 12.1 of the Resolution Draft Enclosed to the Notification as to 
distribution of 75% of our Company’s total distributable net income generated by the Company

Announcement Regarding the Claims of IMTIS Holdings S.à.r.l
IMTIS Holdings S.à.r.l (“IMTIS”), a shareholder of our Company, having sent letters to our 
Company, making public disclosures and engaging in media communications following the 
meeting held at our Company on October 15, 2021, raised several claims in relation to financial, 
operational and corporate governance issues, which were speculative and contradictory, and 
which do not reflect the truth and could potentially mislead other investors. Since the beginning 
of this process, our Company's management team has repeatedly communicated to IMTIS that 397 396ABOUT

CAPITAL
they would be available for a meeting to discuss their respective claims in accordance with the 
regulations, which our Company is subject to, but has not received a positive response. Most 
recently, our management team reiterated its meeting request. 
Our responses to the claims of IMTIS are summarized below and, thus, are shared with our 
shareholders. 
1) Misleading statements regarding the content of the Proxy Advisors’ reports 
IMTIS presented the statements in reports of proxy advisor firms, which advise to the proxy 
voters, in a certain way that may be misleading. Although the respective firms, as part of their 
reports regarding the General Assembly dated April 15, 2021, commented only that board of 
director candidates were not announced in a timely manner, IMTIS misconstrued this to create 
an impression of total weakness in the entire corporate governance processes of Turkcell. 
Furthermore, although advisors explicitly acknowledged that 50% of Turkcell's board members 
were independent in respective period as specified in one of the reports, IMTIS claimed that 
the publisher of the report had concerns regarding the independent Board members and used 
these reports to further its agenda and mislead public. 
2) Misleading statements regarding the opinions of other shareholders 
IMTIS, in its letter dated October 28, 2021 and other subsequent communications, presents itself 
as a representative of other shareholders, yet provides no evidence proving thereof. Having 
pointed out the 83 institutional investors, who voted against the election of the board members 
at the Turkcell General Assembly held in 2021, IMTIS claimed that Turkcell's investors were also 
worried in a similar fashion to them. While ignoring that Turkcell has more than 500 institutional 
investors, IMTIS claimed that the decision of those, who voted against, was also shared by all 
other investors overlooking investors, who voted affirmatively. The most notable contradiction 
is that IMTIS, having voted affirmatively in election of board members during the General 
Assembly meeting dated April 15, 2021, changed its position within a mere 6-month period 
without any valid grounds. Furthermore, IMTIS failed to provide any reasoning or evidence to 
support its claims that investors have lost faith in Turkcell's future. It should also be highlighted 
that IMTIS delivers baseless statements through accusatory communication language in its 
letters. 
3) Misleading statements regarding the process 
Turkcell Board of Directors and management team have devoted extensive time and resources 
to respond to the negative campaign initiated by IMTIS on October 15, 2021. Our Company's 
Board of Directors responded to IMTIS’ letter dated October 28, 2021 on November 12, 2021. 
In that response, our disagreement with such claims were expressed and management 
team was addressed to share information regarding the Company's performance. However, 
IMTIS ignored this response and refused to meet with the management team, and publicly 
announced all written communications between the parties on November 15 and 16, 2021 
through filings and announcements made with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and 
Capital Markets Board of Turkey. The proposal of Turkcell’s Chief Executive Officer to have a 
meeting regarding the claims with IMTIS at their availability was also refused. IMTIS has not held 
any other meetings with the Turkcell management team during such period. As a result, Turkcell 
management team has always acted in a constructive, cooperative and effective manner 
throughout the process and will continue to do so. 
4) Misleading statements of IMTIS in relation to financial and operational performance 
Having carefully reviewed claims of IMTIS on operational and financial performance, we 
see that they reach inaccurate conclusions as they ignore various structural factors when 
comparing Turkcell with other competitors. Turkcell’s operational profitability and free cash 
flow are being compared to telecom companies in other countries, which have different tax 
regime, regulation, demographics and competitive environment. In the respective comparisons, 
IMTIS ignore that Turkcell has a revenue composition, where mobile services have a higher 
contribution, and on those services Turkcell is obliged to pay 15% treasury share and 5% 
frequency usage fee (these items directly impact operational profitability as they are reported 
under cost of sales). Furthermore, a comparison between Turkcell and another operator in 
Turkey is also misleading particularly taking 1% treasury share in fixed telecom services into consideration. Through ignoring these factors, they failed to provide a fair and accurate 
perspective to Turkcell shareholders and potential investors. 
It is seen that IMTIS compared Turkcell’s various financial and operational metrics including its 
subscriber market share and share performance over a specific time period in a potentially 
misleading manner and therefore reached one-sided and subjective conclusions in general. 
We deem Turkcell’s net subscriber addition performance of 3.7 million in the last two years as a 
reflection of the successful execution of the right strategy. 
IMTIS claims that Turkcell’s asset monetization strategy has been stalled despite “a robust 
market environment”. Asset monetization has been an agenda item for us since 2019 when 
they were also represented at our Board of Directors. Since then, the world has gone through 
an unprecedented period due to COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, there has been a volatile 
market environment, which has pressured company valuations in our country. In summary, 
contrary to IMTIS’ claims, there has not been “a robust market environment”. As Turkcell, we 
monitor macro developments and market conditions on a continuous basis in order to act in 
the best interest of our shareholders. Accordingly, we would like to state that we mandated an 
international bank in November 2021 for a partial stake sale process regarding our payment 
services company, which operates under the Paycell brand and that we evaluate different 
strategic options for Superonline. We aim to take actions in a way to realize the full potential of 
our assets. Meanwhile, IMTIS used valuation methods, which do not have a clear basis, and are 
incomparable to our assets, and made certain stake sale assumptions, which are not based on 
a solid foundation or information, and made those public. While such an approach will not aid 
Turkcell investors and other investors, who might be interested in those assets, to make healthy 
decisions, it may also result in expectations, which do not have an objective basis. 
By associating its observations in relation to our international assets with the current Board 
of Directors, IMTIS ignores the fact that investments into those companies have been ongoing 
over the course of many years including those when they were also at the Board of Company. 
Additionally, these observations completely ignore the successful performance of lifecell, our 
largest international subsidiary, improving in the last two years. 
IMTIS’ expectation of USD based dividends is not reasonable or realistic considering the 
reality of currency risk for a company operating in Turkey, an emerging market. As reflected 
by examples of other peers in the past, USD based dividend commitment may expose our 
Company to a significant currency risk and increase its sensitivity to currency rates. 
Lastly, as also stated in several analyst reports, it is seen that IMTIS’s potential actions in equity 
markets, have been a pressurizing factor on Turkcell’s share performance over the last years. 
Taking this into consideration, evaluation of share performance over a specific period, which has 
been intentionally picked out by IMTIS, results in misleading conclusions. 
In accordance with the regulations applicable to our Company, we will continue our open and 
transparent communications with all our investors over respective platforms.
Our Company received a notice from IMTIS Holdings S.à.r.l. dated February 22, 2022 regarding 
the request to add items to the agenda of General Assembly. As a result of the review of our 
Board of Directors, it was evaluated that the requests as per the notice did not differ from those 
included in the notice dated February 2, 2022. Accordingly, it was resolved to respond to the 
respective notice in accordance with the reasonings expressed in our Board resolution dated 
February 11, 2022, which we announced publicly on the same date. March 02, 2022

Statement of compliance with 
corporate governance principles
Turkcell İletişim Hizmetleri A.Ş. (“Turkcell” or the “Company”) is aware of its responsibilities 
towards its stakeholders, with the belief that high standards of corporate governance are key 
to maintain successful business practices and to provide long-term economic value to the 
company’s shareholders. Within this framework, having adopted the principles of “equality,” 
“transparency,” “accountability” and “responsibility” that constitute the basis of corporate 
governance in its activities, the Company exercises due diligence with regard to compliance 
with the Capital Markets Law (“CML”) and the secondary regulations and resolutions of the 
Capital Markets Board (“CMB”). 
In parallel with corporate governance efforts established with the creation of the Investor 
Relations Department at the time of the IPO, and gained momentum in 2003, corporate 
governance mechanisms are being implemented in line with the corporate governance 
principles.  Turkcell İletişim Hizmetleri A.Ş. places a great importance on the full compliance with 
Corporate Governance Principles. Although full compliance with non-mandatory corporate 
governance principles provided in the relevant legislation is aimed, it has yet to be achieved 
due to the challenges in the implementation of certain principles, the incompatibilities 
between some principles and the current structure of the Company and the market. On the 
other hand, an utmost care is given to compliance with mandatory corporate governance 
principles.  
In the activity period that ended as of 31 December 2021, necessary explanations are provided 
in the annual report; (i) the
Corporate Governance Compliance Report (“CGCR”) and (ii) the Corporate Governance Fact 
Sheet (“CGFS”) and (iii) other
relevant sections of the annual report as to the corporate governance principles in the 
annexes of the Communiqué on Corporate Governance with which the compliance is 
achieved as well as the ones that are not yet complied with.Within this framework: 
In line with the regulation and global best practices, as a result of the activities of Corporate 
Governance and Capital Markets Compliance Directorate, which directly reports to the 
Board of Turkcell in an autonomous structure, and in relation with the below process and 
implementation, evaluation forms have been created considering the recommendation of 
the Corporate Governance Committee. Accordingly, in line with the guidance of the Board 
of Directors, each Board member have completed “the Board of Directors Performance 
Evaluation”.
1. The scope of the evaluation process consists of the below set of questions in which the 
answers are measured within a certain scale. 
a. Information provided to the Board before and during the meetings: The set of question 
contained in this section addresses issues such as whether there was timely, clear and 
comprehensive information regarding the meeting agenda items, whether financial 
information highlights important issues and trends, and the effectiveness and impartiality of 
the meetings.
b. Board Composition and Function: The set of question contained in this section addresses 
issues such as whether the members have the necessary qualifications, experience and skills, 
whether a sufficient number of meetings are held, and the functioning of the committees.
c. Board Dynamics: The set of question contained in this section addresses the main issues 
such as the effectiveness of the oversight, adequacy of annual business plan reviews and 
whether the company's value, mission, strategy, business plans are reflected on important 
issues, and whether financial indicators are followed up properly.
d. Standards of Conduct: The set of question contained in this section addresses issues such 
as conflict of interest and adequacy of contribution.
2.Within the above methodology, each Board Member have made seperate evaluations.
3.Feedbacks of the Board Members have been reviewed. 
4.Actions for the process improvement have been identified as a result of the reviewed and 
analysed feedback. 
Taking into account the amendments of the regulations and the practices, future efforts will 
continue to improve our corporate governance practices and, to ensure, within the framework 
of these principles, the better operation of the mechanisms with respect to the corporate 
governance practices of the partnership. 
Should the CGCR or CGFS be amended within the activity period, a material event disclosure 
will be made, and this amendment will be included in the interim activity reports.An agreement has been made between our Company and Re-Pie Portföy Yönetimi A.Ş. (RePie) to 
establish a Venture Capital Investment Fund (VCIF) in order to invest in ventures that are in line with our 
Company’s business model and can create synergies with our Group’s strategic focus areas. On March 
7, 2022, the founder, Re-Pie, applied to the Capital Markets Board for the "Re-Pie Portföy Yönetimi A.Ş. 
Turkcell New Technologies Venture Capital Investment Fund". 
With this fund, it is aimed to invest in technology-oriented ventures with high growth potential thereby 
supporting the respective companies reach their growth targets. Moreover, it is aimed to create 
strategic and financial benefits and accordingly long-term value for our Company through synergies to 
be generated with these ventures. 
The fund's Investment Committee will consist of a total of 6 members, 3 of which will be Turkcell 
representatives. The committee's decisions will be determined with the affirmative votes of all Turkcell 
representatives. Serkan Öztürk, Mehmet Akif Konar and Ali Serdar Yağcı have been elected as the 
members to the committee as our Company's representatives. 
The announcement regarding initiation of discussions to establish the respective fund was postponed 
as per the Board of Directors decision in accordance with the Article-6 of Capital Market Board’s 
Communiqué on Material Events Disclosure, due to the fact that such an announcement at a stage 
when the process was not finalized could have misled investors.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 22.0% in FY21.Depreciation and amortization expenses
Net finance expense increased to TRY2,901 million (TRY1,132 million) due mainly to 
higher net FX loss after hedging led by Turkish Lira depreciation. Net finance expense
Deferred tax income of TRY1,172 million and current tax expense of TRY682 million was 
reported, leading to an income tax gain of TRY490 million.
Please note that in Q221 and Q421, we made use of the right introduced by Article 
11 of the Law No. 7326, that allows the revaluation of properties and depreciable 
economic assets under certain conditions. As per the law, the respective assets 
can be revalued according to PPI until the year-end and a 2% tax is applied for 
the revaluation difference. For revalued assets, the valuation difference can be 
depreciated and written-off as an expense. This resulted in a positive impact on 
the deferred tax asset reported in the respective quarters. Please refer to our 
consolidated financial statements and notes as at December 31, 2021 for details.Income tax expense
Group net income rose 18.7% to TRY5,031 million (TRY4,237 million) on the back of 
strong operational performance and the deferred tax income impact despite a higher

TRY24,805 million as of September 30, 2021 due mainly to the impact of currency 
movements. Please note that TRY2,906 million of our consolidated debt is comprised 
of lease obligations.
Consolidated debt breakdown excluding lease obligations:
TRY1,262 million of lease obligations is denominated in TRY, TRY81 million (US$6 million)

was at TRY14,622 million with a leverage of 1.0 times.
Turkcell Group had a short FX position of US$191 million as at the end of the fourth 
quarter (Please note that this figure takes advance payments into account). Due to 
significant currency depreciation during the fourth quarter, the strike levels of call 
options as part of some of participating cross currency swaps were exceeded. This 
had a negative impact on our FX position during the quarter. The short FX position of 
US$191 million is in line with our FX neutral definition, which is between -US$200 million 
and +US$200 million.Total cash & debt435 434 2VALUE CREATING

In four separate lawsuits filed by our 
Company and Superonline with the 
request for the stay of execution and the 
cancellation of the ICTA’s transactions 
that restrict/prevent the use of the 444

the aforementioned ICTA transactions, an 
application has been made to the ICTA by 
our Company to execute the requirements 
of the court decisions and to eliminate 
the illegality in practice. Upon the implicit 
rejection of this application, another 
lawsuit was filed, and the court accepted 
this case in favor of our Company. After the defendant administration’s appeal and the

defendant administration’s appeal, the ICTA 
appealed the aforementioned decision, and the 
appeal is pending. In the meantime, the ICTA

regarding this dispute. However, even though 
ICTA is conducting assessments and regulatory 
works related to this dispute, Superonline made 
an application to the ICTA for the withdrawal of 
the Board Decision and related administrative 
acts since the existing illegality has not been 
eliminated with the Board decision and related

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
 
To the  Shareholders and Board of Directors of Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri A.S . 
 
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Turkcell Iletisim 
Hizmetleri A. S. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 202 1 and 20 20, and the related 
consolidated statements of profit or loss, other comprehensive income, changes in equity and the cash 
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 202 1, including the related notes 
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements” ). We also have audited th e Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 202 1, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control - Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (COSO).  
 
In our op inion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 202 1 and 20 20, and the results of its 
operations and its cash flows for each of the three year s in the period ended December 31, 202 1 in 
conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal 
cont rol over financial reporting as of December 31, 202 1, based on criteria established in Internal  
Control - Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the COSO.  
 
Basis for Opinions  
 
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial stateme nts, for maintaining 
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal 
control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over 
Financial Reporting appearin g under Item 15b. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s 
consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on 
our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Co mpany Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission a nd the PCAOB.  
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we 
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial 
statements are free of material missta tement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal 
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  
 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and 
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, 
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, a s 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal 
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial 
reporting, assessing the risk that a mater ial weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing 
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe tha t our audits 
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.   
 
Subsequent event  
 
We draw attention to the Note 44  to the consolidated financial statements which describes the effects of 
Russia -Ukraine war  on the Company .  
 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
control over finan cial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)  pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company (ii)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, 
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the company; and (iii)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have 
a material effect on the financial statement s. 
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate b ecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
 
Critical Audit Matters  
 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the 
consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit 
committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial 
statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjec tive, or complex judgments. The 
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing 
separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Valuation of derivative instruments  
 
As described in Notes 2(i) and 3 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company uses participating 
cross currency swap contracts to hedge its currency risk and interest risk. Management makes significant 
judgment to value derivative instruments and uses prices in the bid - ask pric e range that are considered 
the most appropriate are used instead of mid prices in valuation model. For the year ended December 31, 
2021 , as a result of valuation of participating cross currency swaps fair value change, derivative assets of 
TRY 1,049,129  thousand have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.  
 
The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to management’s 
valuation of the derivative instruments is a critical audit matter is there was s ignificant judgment and 
assumptions by management to determine the fair value of these instruments due to the use of an 
internally  developed model, which included significant judgment  and assumptions  related to the bid -ask 
price range. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgment to evaluate the audit 
evidence  obtained related to the valuation, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with 
specialized skill s and knowledge.  
 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with 
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing  
the effectiveness of controls relating to participating cross currency swaps’ val uation, testing the 
completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and evaluating management’s judgments 
related to the bid -ask price range. Professionals with specialized skill s and knowledge were also used to 
assist in the valuation of Company’ s participating cross currency swaps.  
 
Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses  
 
As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had recognise d deferred 
tax assets  on its tax losses  based on their estimated recoverability and management judge ment  that  it is 
probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits to utilise the assets in the future . For the year ended 
December 31, 202 1, the Company recognized deferred  tax asset of TRY 1,142,901 thousand  in re lation to 
tax losses  in its operations in Ukraine , as management concluded it is probable that the Ukrain ian entity, 
lifecell  LLC will continue to generate taxable income in the future against which they can utilise these 
assets . based on prospective financial information . Management’s prospective financial information for the 
lifecell LLC included  significant judgments and as sumptions relating to revenue growth rates, interest 
rates, profitability measures and capital expenditures.  
  
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to recognition and 
recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by 
management when determining the recoverability of these assets, including a high degree of estimation 
uncertainty in relation to the assumptions made  including revenue growth rates, interest rates, profitability 
measures and cap ital expenditures ; and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity , and effort in 
performing procedures  and evaluating management’s assessment of deferred tax assets on tax losses.  
 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluati ng audit evidence in connection with  
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing  
the effectiveness of controls relating to the recognition of deferred tax assets ; evaluating the reasonableness 
of the prospective financial information and  data used  which includes  significant judgments and 
assumptions relating to revenue growth rates, interest rates, profitability measures and capital expenditures . 
These procedures also included, among others, testing the information used in the evaluation of 
recoverability of deferred tax assets, including prospective business plan.

 1. Reporting entity  
Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri Anonim Sirketi (the “Company”  or “Turkcell” ) was incorporated in Turkey on  
5 October 1993 and commenced its operations in 1994. The address of the Company’s registered office is 
Maltepe Aydinevler Mahallesi Inonu Caddesi No: 20, Kucukyali Ofispark/Istanbul. It is engaged in 
establishing and operating a Global System for Mobile Co mmunications (“GSM”) network in Turkey and 
regional states.  
In April 1998, the Company signed a license agreement (the “2G License”) with the Ministry of Transport 
and Infrastructure of Turkey (the “Turkish Ministry”), under which it was granted a 25 -year GSM license in 
exchange for a license fee of USD 500,000. The License permits the Company to operate as a stand -alone 
GSM operator and releases it from some of the operating constraints in the Revenue Sharing Agreement, 
which was in effect prior to the 2G License . Under 2G license , the Company pays in cash the Undersecretariat 
of the Treasury (the “Turkish Treasury”) a monthly tax levy , namely a 'treasury share' equal to 15% of the 
Company's gross revenue from Turkish GSM operations. The Company continues to build and operate its 
GSM network and is authorized to, among other things, set its own tariffs within certain limits, charge peak 
and off -peak rates, offer a variety of service and pricing packages, issue invoices directly to subscribers, collect 
paymen ts and deal directly with subscribers. Following the 3G tender held by the Information Technologies 
and Communications Authority (“ICTA”) regarding the authorization for providing IMT -2000/UMTS 
services and infrastructure, the Company has been granted the A-Type license (the “3G License”) providing 
the widest frequency band, at a consideration of EUR 358,000 (excluding Value Added Tax (“VAT”)). 
Payment of the 3G license was made in cash, following the necessary approvals, on 30 April 2009.  
On 26 August 2015 , “Authorization Tender on IMT Services and Infrastructure” publicly known as “4.5G 
license ” tender, was held by the ICTA and the Company was awarded with a total frequency band of  
172.4 MHz for 13 years. The tender price is EUR 1,623,460 (excluding VAT o f 18%). IMT authorization 
period expires on 30 April 2029 and operators were able to commence service delivery for 4.5G starting from  
1 April 2016. 2x1.4 MHz frequency band in 900MHz spectrum and 2 units of 2x5 MHz frequency bands in 
2100 MHz spectrum  were  commenced on 1 December 2015, while remaining packages  were  commenced on 
1 April 2016.  
The Company is obliged to pay the ICTA a monthly treasury share equal to 90% of 15% of gross revenue and 
10% is paid for a universal service fund. In addi tion, the Company pays annual contributions in an amount 
equal to 0.35% of net revenue to the ICTA’s expenses and 5% of net revenue to ICTA  as a frequency fee  
(TRx) . 
As of 31 December 2021, the capital shares and voting rights of TVF Bilgi Teknolojileri İl etisim Hizmetleri 
Yatırım Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim S irketi (“TVF BTIH”) and IMTIS Holdings S.a r l. (“IMTIS Holdings”) in 
the Company are 26.2% and 19.8%, respectively  since 22 October 2020 . The proportion of the Company’s 
shares that are traded in domesti c and foreign stock exchanges are 53.95% (Note 27).   
The Group’s immediate and ultimate parents are TVF BTIH , wholly owned by Turkiye Varl ik Fonu (“ TVF ”), 
and TVF respectively as of 31 December 2021. TVF has been established with the Law No. 6741 and published

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  
(c) Functional and presentation currency  
 (i) Transactions and balances  
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange 
rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the 
reporting date are translated int o the functional currency using the exchange rates at that date.  
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are 
translated to the functional currency using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. 
Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain 
or loss. For example, translation differences on non -monetary assets and liabilities such as assets held at fair 
value through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss and translation 
differences on assets classified as at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized in other 
comprehensive income.  
Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss, except:  
• For capitalized foreign exchange differences relating to borrowings to the extent that they are regarded 
as an adjustment to interest costs eligible for capitalization.  
 
Foreign exchange differences are deferred in equity if they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying 
net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses are presented  in the statement of profit or loss on a net basis within finance income or finance 
costs.  
(ii) Foreign operations  
The results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary 
economy) that have a functio nal currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the 
presentation currency as follows:  
• Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of 
that balance sheet , 
• Equity for each ba lance sheet presented is translated at historic cost at the date of transaction,  
• Income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and statement of comprehensive income are 
translated at average monthly exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonabl e approximation of the 
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses 
are translated at the dates of the transactions) and  
• All resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the foreign currency translation reserve, in equity.  
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other financial 
instruments designated as hedges of any net investment in for eign entities are recognized in other 
comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold or  any borrowings forming part of the net investment 
are repaid  the associated exchange differences are reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss  on 
sale. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

 2. Basis of preparation and summar y of significant accounting policies (continued)  
(d) Use of estimates and judgments  
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates. Management 
also needs to exercise judgment in applying the Group’s accoun ting policies. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.  
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Alterations to accounting estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.  
Information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial 
statements are desc ribed below:  
Allowance for doubtful receivables  
The Group maintains an allowance for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of 
the Group’s subscribers and customers to make required payments. The Group bases the allowance on  the 
likelihood of recoverability of trade receivables, receivables from financial services and other receivables; 
when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of asset and that event s have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or 
group of financial assets that could be reliably estimated. The allowance is periodically reviewed. The 
allowance charged to expenses is determined in respect of receiv able balances, calculated as a specified 
percentage of the outstanding balance in each aging group, with the percentage of the allowance increasing as 
the aging of the receivable progresses.  
Capitalization and useful lives of assets  
The useful lives and re sidual values of the Group’s assets are estimated by management at the time the asset 
is acquired and regularly reviewed for appropriateness. The Group defines useful li ves of its assets in terms of 
the assets’ expected utility to the Group. This judgment is based on the experience of the Group with similar 
assets. In determining the useful life of an asset, the Group also follows technical and/or commercial 
obsolescence arising on changes or improvements from a change in the market. The useful lives of the  
telecommunication licenses are based on the duration of the license agreements.  
Gross versus net presentation of revenue  
When the Group acts as principal in sale of goods or rendering of services, revenue from customers and costs 
with suppliers are report ed on a gross basis. When the Group acts as agent in sale of goods or rendering of 
services, revenue from customers and costs related to suppliers are reported on a net basis, representing the net 
margin earned. Whether the Group is acting as principal or agent depends on management’s analysis of both 
legal form and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgments impact 
the amount of reported revenue and costs but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flow s. 
Contracted handset sales  
The Company, the distributors and dealers offer joint campaigns to the subscribers which may include the sale 
of device by the dealer and/or distributor and a communication service to be provided by the Company. The 
Company does  not recognize any  revenue for the device in these transactions by considering the factors below : 
 - The Company is  not the primary obligor for the sale of handset,  
 - The Company does not have control over the sale prices of handsets, 
 - The Company has no inventory risk .

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

currency units and are expressed in Turkish Liras unless otherwise stated. )

 2.  Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies  (continued)  
(d) Use of estimates and judgments (continued)  
Multiple performance obligations and price allocation  
In arrangements which include multiple elements where the Group acts as principal, the Group considers that 
these bundled elements involve consideration in the form of a fixed fee or a fixed fee coupled  with a continuing 
payment stream. A good or service is distinct if both of the following criteria are met:  
• The good or service is capable of being distinct ,   
• The promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract.  
The arrangement consideration is allocated to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on 
relative stand -alone selling prices. If an element of a transaction is not distinct, then it is accounted for as an 
integral part of the remaining ele ments of the transaction.  
Income taxes  
The calculation of income taxes involves a degree of estimation and judgment in respect of certain items whose 
tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authori ty or, 
as appropriate, through formal legal process.  
As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group is required to estimate the 
income taxes in each of the jurisdictions and countries in which it operates. This process  involves estimating 
the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing 
treatment of items, such as deferred revenue and reserves for tax and accounting purposes.  
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which unrecognized tax losses and temporary differences can be utilized . Recognition, 
therefore, involves judgment regarding t he future financial performance of the particular legal entity in which 
the deferred tax asset has been recognized.  
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets  
As detailed and disclosed in Note 3 9, the Group is involved in a number of investigations and legal proceedings 
(both as a plaintiff and as a defendant) arising in the ordinary course of business. All these investigations and 
litigations are evaluated by the Group Management and disclosed  (unless information concerning provisions  
are very sensitive, and full disclosure could prejudice the outcome of cases)  or accounted  for in the consolidated 
financial statements. Future results or outcome of these investigations and litigations might differ from  these 
Group Management’s expectati ons. As at the reporting date, the Group Management believes that appropriate 
recognition criteria and measurement basis are applied to provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets and that sufficient information is disclosed in the notes to en able users to understand their nature, timing 
and amount by considering current conditions and circumstances.  
Annual impairment review  
The Group’s non -current are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
fair value less costs of dispo sal and value in use.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies  (continued)  
(d) Use of estimates and judgments (continued)  
Fair value measurements and valuation process  
Some of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In 
estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company uses market -observable data to the extent it is 
available. The management works clo sely with the qualified external experts to establish the appropriate 
valuation techniques and inputs to the model. Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in 
determining the fair value of various assets and liabilities is disclosed in  
Note 3 7. 
(e) Changes in accounting policies  
Other than the adoption of the new and revised standards as explained in Note 2(z), the Group did not make 
any significant changes to its accounting policies during the current year.  
 (f) Changes in accounting estimates  
If the application of changes in the accounting estimates affects the financial results of a specific period, the 
changes in the accounting estimates are applied in that specific period, if they affect the financial results of 
current and following periods; the accounting estimate is applied prospectively in the period in which such 
change is made. A change in the measurement basis applied is a change in an accounting policy, and is not a 
change in an accounting estimate.  
The Co mpany does not have significant changes in accounting estimates during the year.  
(g) Comparative information and revision of prior period financial statements  
The Group divided its reporting segment into two groups according to its previous assessment. Rel evant groups 
had been established within the framework of an integrated communication and technology service delivery 
strategy and in a way to ensure economic integrity. Considering current developments, the Management has 
made an evaluation regarding the updating of the reportable segments according to the strategies of the 
Company, and has planned to add the Techfin reportable segment. Turkcell Finansman A.S.  (“Turkcell 
Finansman”), Turkcell Odeme Hizmetleri A.S. (“Turkcell Odeme”), Paycell LLC (“Paycell” ) and Turkcell 
Sigorta Aracilik Hizmetleri A.S (“Turkcell Sigorta”) will be included in Techfin reportable segment. The 
operating results of the mentioned companies were disclosed in the Other reportable segment within the scope 
of the previous reporting f ramework. In addition to the mentioned changes, Turkcell Satis ve Dijital Is 
Servisleri  Hizmetleri A.S. (“Turkcell Satis”), which are reported under Turkcell Turkey reportable segment is 
separated as digital business services and other Turkcell Satis opera tions: integrated corporate business 
solutions, city hospitals, equipment and corporate terminal activities will be continued to be reported under 
Turkcell Turkey reportable segment as digital business services, while other Turkcell Satis operations which 
include retail channel operations, smart devices management and consumer electronics sales through digital 
channels will be reported in the Other reportable segment.   
The Group has made the above -mentioned classifications in the notes (Note 5 and Note 6)  to the consolidated 
financial statements as of 31 December 2020.  These classifications have no impact on operating profit, profit 
for the year and cash flow statement.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  
(h) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting  
(i) Business combinations  
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a 
business combination compri ses: 
• The fair value of  the assets transferred, 
• Liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business,  
• Equity interests issued by the Group,  
• The fair value of  any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, and  
• The fair value of  any pre -existing equity interest in the subsidiary. 
Acquisition -related costs are expensed as incurred.  
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, 
with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.  
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred, amount of any non -controlling interest in 
the acquired entity, and acquisition -date fair value of  any previously held equity interest in the acquired entity 
over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net 
identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognized dir ectly in profit or loss as a bargain 
purchase. The Group recognizes any non -controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition -by-
acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non -controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired 
entity’s net identifiable assets. 
Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted 
to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing 
rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under 
comparable terms and conditions.  
Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial 
liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. 
Contingent consideration classified as equity is not subject to remeasurement.   Instead, any gain or loss at 
settlement is recorded as an adjustment t o equity through other comprehensive income . 
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any g ains or 
losses arising from such remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss.  
(ii) Subsidiaries  
Subsidiaries comprise all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the 
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable re turns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are decons olidated from the date that control 
ceases.  
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there 
are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.  
Intercompany transactions, ba lances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are 
eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of 
the transferred asset.  
Accounting policies of s ubsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.

(ii) Subsidiaries (continued) 
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statem ent 
of financial position , respectively.  
Non-controlling interest has not been attributed to Belarus Telekom is financed solely by the Company and 
management’s assessment of relevant articles of the share purchase agreement with the non -controlling 
shareho lder. 
 (iii) Changes in ownership interests  
The Group treats transactions with non -controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions 
with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment betwee n the carrying 
amounts of the controlling and non -controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any 
difference between the amount of the adjustment to the non -controlling and any consideration paid or received 
is recognized in a separate reserve within equity attributable to owners of the Company.  
When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint 
control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is  remeasured to its fair value with the change 
in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the 
purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or finan cial asset. 
In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are 
accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that 
amounts previously recognize d in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.  
If the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant influence 
is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recogni zed in other comprehensive income 
are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.   
(iv) Business combinations under common control  
Business combinations between entities or businesses under common control are excluded from the scope of 
IFRS 3. In a business combination under common control, assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are stated 
at predecessor carrying values. Any di fference between the consideration given and the aggregate book value 
of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity at the date of the transaction is recognized in equity. The 
acquired entity’s results and financial position are incorporated as if b oth entities (acquirer and acquiree) had 
always been combined, or using the results from the date when either entity joined the Group, where such a 
date is later.  
(v) Put option over shares relating to non -controlling interests  
Where a put option is written by the Group on shares in an existing subsidiary held by non -controlling interests, 
the Group recognizes a financial liability at the present value of the redemption amount to reflect the put option. 471 470

 (h) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting  (continued)   
(v) Put option over shares relating to non -controlling interests (continued) 
Reserve for put option over shares relating to non -controlling interests included in equity arises from the 
difference between the fair value of the put option written by Fintur Holdings B.V. (“Fintur”) on non -
controlling shares in one of its subsidiaries and the derecognized non -controlling interests relating to that put 
option.  
(vi) Investments in associates and joint ventures  
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control. This 
is generally the  case where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in 
associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting after initially being recognized at cost.  
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties tha t have joint control of the arrangement have rights 
to the net assets of the joint arrangement.  The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated 
in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.  
Unde r the equity method of accounting, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and adjusted 
thereafter to recognize the Group’s share of the post -acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or 
loss, and the Group’s share of mo vements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other 
comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates are recognized as a reduction in the 
carrying amount of the investment.  
When the Group’s share of losses in an equity -accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in that entity, 
including any other unsecured long -term receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity.  
Unrealized  gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence 
of an impairment of the asset transferred. Ac counting policies of equity accounted investees have been changed 
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.  
On acquisition of an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair 
values of the associate’s identifiable assets and liabilities is recognized as goodwill, which is included in the 
carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the associate’s 
identifiable assets and liabilitie s over the cost of the investment is included as part of the Group’s share of the 
associate profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.  
The carrying amount of equity -accounted investments is tested for impairment. The Group measures a n 
associate that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount at the date of classification as 
held for sale and fair value less costs of disposal. Equity accounting ceases once an associate is classified as 
held for sale.   
(i) Financial instruments  
 Classification  
From 1 January 2018, the Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:  
- Those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss) and  
- Those to be measured at amortized cost.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies  (continued)  
(i) Financial instruments (continued)  
 Classification (continued) 
The classification depends on the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual 
terms of the cash flows.  
For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For 
investments in equity instruments that are not h eld for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made 
an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).  
The Group reclassifies debt investment s when and only when its business model for managing those assets 
changes.  
 Recognition and derecognition  
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on trade date, the date on which the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset. F inancial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows 
from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership.  
 Measurement  
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset 
not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. Transact ion costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.  
Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their 
cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.  
(i) Debt instruments  
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset 
and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group 
classifies its debt instruments:  
- Amortized cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent 
solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost. Interest income from these financial 
assets is included in finance i ncome using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss.  
- FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where 
the asse ts’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements 
in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest 
income and foreign exchange gains and loss es which are recognized in profit or loss. When the financial asset 
is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit 
or loss. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest 
rate method.  
- FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or 
loss on a debt instruments that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognized in profit or loss in t he period 
in which it arises.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies  (continued)  
(i) Financial instruments (continued)  
 Measurement (continued) 
(ii) Equity instruments  
The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group’s management has 
elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent 
reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or lo ss following the derecognition of the investment. 
Dividends from such investments continue to be recognized in profit or loss as other income when the Group’s 
right to receive payments is established.  
Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL a re recognized in the statement of profit or loss as 
applicable. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI 
are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.  
 Impairment  
From 1 January 2018, the Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with 
its debt instruments carried at amortized cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on 
whether there has been a significant increase in credit r isk. 
Loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases.  
• 12 month expected credit losses (ECLs): these are ECLs that result from possible default events within 
the 12 months after the reporting date and 
• Lifetime ECLs: these are ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a 
financial instrument.  
The Group applies  simplified  lifetime ECL measurement for all group companies except Turkcell Finansman  
which applies both 12 month and lifetime ECL (general approach).  Financial instruments subject to ECL 
measurement mainly consist of trade receivables.  
Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities  
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and th e net amount presented in the statement of financial position 
where the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts, and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneous ly.  
Cash and cash equivalents  
For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on 
hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions and other short -term, highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.  
Trade receivables  
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services perfo rmed in the ordinary course 
of business. If collection of the amounts is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If 
not, they are presented as non -current assets.  
Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subs equently measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. See Note 3 7 for a description of the Group’s 
impairment policies.

Trade and other payables  
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial 
year which are unpaid. Trade and other  payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due 
within 12 months after the reporting period. They are recognized initially at their fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.  
Related  part ies 
A related party is a person or entity that is related to the Group.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies  (continued)  
(i) Financial instruments (continued)  
Borrowings  
Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption 
amount is recognized in profit or loss over the  period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the extent 
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the 
draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be 
drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of  the 
facility to which it relates.  
Borrowings are removed from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract 
is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that h as 
been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non -cash assets 
transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss.  
Derivatives and hedging activities   
Derivative instruments are initially rec ognized at the acquisition cost reflecting the fair value on the date on 
which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. The derivative 
instruments of the Group mainly consist of participating cross currency swap contracts, cross currency /interest 
rate swap contracts, foreign currency swap contracts and currency forward contracts instruments. These 
derivative transactions, even though providing effective economic hedges under the Group risk management 
position, do  not generally qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules and are therefore treated as 
derivatives held for trading in the consolidated financial statements. The fair value changes for these 
derivatives are recognised in the consolidated income statement.  
Fair values of foreign exchange forwards, interest rate and foreign exchange swaps (IRS, Cross Currency 
Swaps etc.) and options are calculated with market levels of interest rates and Central Bank of Republic of 
Turkey (“CBRT”) exchange rates vi a valuation methods and pricing instruments  correspondent with market 
standards . If market levels are not available for valuation date, fair value for forward contracts will be the value 
of the discounted future value of the difference between contract price level and forward value of CBRT 
exchange rate with risk free rates for the period. Interest rate and currency swaps will be valued with the 
difference of the discounted cash flows of each leg of the swaps using risk free rates and CBRT excha nge 
rates. Option transactions will be valued with option pricing models using risk free rates and CBRT exchange 
rates.  
At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging 
instrume nts and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are 
expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transacti ons. The hedging transactions of the Group that 
qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies  (continued)  
(i) Financial instruments (continued)  
Derivatives and hedging activities  (continued)  
 (i) Fair value hedge  
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as fair value hedges are recorded in 
the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are 
attributable to the hedged risk. The  change in the fair value of hedged asset or liability attributable to the 
hedged risk is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability during the effective hedging 
relationship. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge  accounting, the adjustment to the carrying 
amount of a hedged item, for which the effective interest method is used, is amortised using a recalculated 
effective interest rate.  
(ii) Cash flow hedge  
Hedges of exposures to variability in cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk associated with a 
recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit and loss are 
designated as cash flow hedges by the Group in accordance with IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirem ent.  
 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges is recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognized imme diately in profit or loss. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the 
change in intrinsic value of the options are recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The 
changes in the time value of the options that relate to the hedged  item (“aligned time value”) are recognized 
within OCI in the costs of hedging reserve within equity.  
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, as 
follows:  
- Where the hedged item subsequen tly results in the recognition of a non -financial asset, both the deferred 
hedging gains and losses and the deferred time value of the option contracts or deferred forward points, if any, 
are included within the initial cost of the asset. The deferred amou nts are ultimately recognized in profit or 
loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss.  
- The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings 
is recognized in profit or loss within finance cost at the same time as the interest expense on the hedged 
borrowings.  
The new effectiveness test model may be qualitative depending on the complexity of hedging relationship 
provided that it is prospective only. The 80 -125% range in IAS 39 is replaced by an o bjectives -based test that 
focuses on the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, and the effect of 
credit risk on that economic relationship.  
Under IFRS 9, at inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the e conomic relationship between 
hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments 
are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management 
objective and  strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions. When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or 
terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain 
or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction 
occurs, resulting in the recognition of a non -financial asset. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging that  were reported in equity are immediately 
reclassified to profit or loss.  477 476

(i) Financial instruments (continued)  
Derivatives and hedging activities  (continued)  
Under IFRS 9, a hedging relationship is discontinued in its entirety when as a whole it ceases to meet the 
qualifying criteria after considering the rebalancing of the hedging relationship. Voluntary discontinuation 
when the qualifyi ng criteria are met is prohibited. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the risk management 
objective for the hedging relationship has changed, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised, there is no longer an economic relationship  between the hedged item and hedging instrument or 
when the effect of credit risk starts dominating the value changes that result from the economic relationship.  
When the Group discontinues hedge accounting for a cash flow hedge it shall account for the am ount that has 
been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in accordance as follows;  
-If the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur, that amount shall remain in the cash flow hedge 
reserve until the future cash flows occur.  
-When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time 
remains in equity until the forecast transact ion occurs, resulting in the recognition of a non -financial asset. 
When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of 
hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit o r loss.  
 (iii) Foreign currency hedge of net investments in foreign operations  
Foreign exchange gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the foreign 
currency hedge of net investments in foreign operations are recognize d in other comprehensive income while 
any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement. Tax effects of 
foreign exchange gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the foreign 
currency hedge of net investments in foreign operations is recognized under other comprehensive income as 
well (Note 36)  
On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded in equity is 
transferred to the income statement (Note  17). 
(j) Property, plant and equipment  
(i) Recognition and measurement  
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation and impairment losses. 
Property, plant and equipment related to the Company and its subsidiaries operating in Turkey are adjusted for 
the effects of inflation during the hyperinflationary period ended on 31 December 2005. Since the inflation 
accounting commenced on 1 January 2011, property, plant and equipment related to t he subsidiaries operating 
in Belarus are adjusted for the effects of inflation. However, the decrease in inflation rate in subsequent years 
led the three -year cumulative rate as of the end of 2014 to decrease to 65%. Accordingly, the economy of 
Belarus was  considered as transitioning out of hyperinflationary status and in 2015 it was determined to be 
appropriate to cease applying IAS 29. Therefore, subsidiaries operating in Belarus ceased applying IAS 29 in 
2015.  
Historical cost in cludes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self -
constructed assets includes cost of materials and direct labor, any other costs directly attributable to bringing 
the asset to a working condition for its in tended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and 
restoring the site on which they are located, if any.

 (j) Property, plant and equipment (continued)  
(i) Recognition and measurement (continued)  
Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that 
equipment. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.  
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are 
included in profit or loss.  
Changes  in the obligation to dismantle, remove assets on sites and to restore sites on which they are located, 
other than changes deriving from the passing of time, are added or deducted from the cost of the assets in the 
period in which they occur. The amount de ducted from the cost of the asset shall not exceed the balance of the 
carrying amount on the date of change, and any excess balance is recognized immediately in profit or loss. An 
asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amoun t if the asset’s carrying amount 
is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.  
 (ii) Subsequent costs  
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future e conomic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate 
asset is derecognized when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the 
reporting period in which they are incurred. 
 (iii) Depreciation  
Depreciation is calculated using the straight -line method to allocate their cost, net of their residual values, over 
their estimated usefu l lives.  
Land is not depreciated.  
The estimated useful lives are as follows:  
 Mobile network infrastructure  4 – 20 years  
 Fixed network infrastructure  3 – 25 years  
 Call center equipment    4 – 8 years  
 Buildings  21 – 25 years  
 Equipment, fixtures and fittings  2 – 10 years  
 Motor vehicles    4 – 6 years  
 Electricity  power plant   20 years  
 Leasehold improvements    3 – 5 years  
 
 
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of 
each reporting period.  
(iv) Borrowing costs  
General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production 
of a qualifying asset are capitalized during the period that is required to complete and prepare the a sset for its 
intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period to get ready for their 
intended use or sale.  
Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred .

(i) Telecommunication licenses  
Separately acquired  telecommunication licenses are stated at historical cost adjusted for the effects of inflation 
during the hyperinflationary period, where applicable, less amortization and impairment losses.  
 Amortization  
Amortization is recognized in the statement of pro fit or loss on a straight -line basis by reference to the license 
period. The useful lives for telecommunication licenses are as follows:  
Telecommunications licenses  3 – 25 years  
The Company has been granted the 2G, 3G and 4.5G licenses on 27 April 1998, 30 July 2009 and  
26 August 2015, respectively. The licenses are effective for 25, 20 and 13 years, respectively.  
 (ii) Computer software  
Acquired computer software licenses are ca pitalized bas ed on the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use 
the specific software.  
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognized as an expense as incurred.  
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software 
products controlled by the Group are recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:  
• It is technically feasible to complete the software such that it will be available for use , 
• Management intends to complete the software and use or sell it , 
• There is an ability to use or sell the software , 
• It can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits , 
• Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the 
software are available and  
• The expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.  
Directly attributable co sts that are capitalized as part of the software include employee costs and an appropriate 
portion of relevant overheads.  
Research expenditure and development expenditure that do not meet the criteria above are recognized as an 
expense as incurred. Develop ment costs previously recognized as an expense are not recognized as an asset in 
a subsequent period.  
Capitalized development costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortized from the point at which the 
asset is ready for use.  
 Amortization  
Amortizati on is recognized in the statement of profit or loss on a straight -line basis over the estimated useful 
lives. The useful lives for computer software are as follows:  
 Computer software     3 – 8 years  
Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values ar e reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of 
each reporting period.

(iii) Other intangible assets  
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group which have finite useful lives are stated at historical cost 
adjusted for the effects of inflation during the hyperinflationary period, where applicable, less amortization 
and impairment losses.  Indefeasible Rights of Use (“IRU”) are rights to use a portion of an asset’s capacity 
granted for a fixed period of time. IRUs are recognized as intangible asset when the Group has specific 
indefeasible rights to use an identified portion of an underlying  asset and the duration of the right is for the 
major part of the underlying asset's useful economic life. IRUs are amortized over the shorter of the underlying 
asset's useful economic life  and the contract term.  
Amortization  
Amortization is recognized in the statement of profit or loss on a straight -line basis over the estimated useful 
lives. The useful lives for computer software are as follows:   
 Indefeasible right of use          15 years  
 Transmission line software     5 – 10 years  
 Brand name  9 – 10 ye ars 
 Customer base     2 – 15 years  
 Subscriber acquisition cost          2 -  6 years  
 Electricity production license             20 years  
Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of 
each reporting period.  
Goodwill  
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized but it is 
tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might 
be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an 
entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.  
Goodwill is allocated to cash -generating units for the purpose of impair ment testing. The allocation is made to 
those cash -generating units or groups of cash -generating units that are expected to benefit from the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or groups of units are identified at the lowest level a t which 
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, being the operating segments.  
 (l) Investment properties  
 Recognition and measurement 
Investment properties are properties held for rental yields and/or for capital appreciation (including property 
under construction for such purposes). Investment properties are stated at historical cost less depreciation and 
impairment losses.  
An investment property is derecognized upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently 
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising 
on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset) is included in pr ofit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognized.

 Depreciation  
Depreciation is calculated using the straight -line method to allocate their cost, net of their residual values, over 
their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:  
 Investment Property     25 -  45 years  
Depreciation methods, useful lives and resid ual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end 
of each reporting period.  
 (m) Inventories  
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost of inventory 
is determined using the weighted average method and comprises all costs of purchase and other costs incurred 
in bringing the inventories to their present location an d condition. Costs of purchased inventory are determined 
after deducting rebates and discounts. At 31  December  2021 and 20 20, inventories mainly consisted of mobile 
phone and its accessories, tablet, sim -cards, tower construction materials  and other electr onic products .  
(n) Impairment of assets 
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are tested 
annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be 
impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its  recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value 
less costs of disposal and its value in use. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction betwee n market participants at the measurement date.  
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash -
generating unit. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels (cash -
generating units) for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the 
cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Non -financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an 
impairment are reviewed for possi ble reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.  
(o) Employee benefits  
(i) Short -term obligations  
Liabilities for salaries including non -monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within  
12 months after the end of the peri od in which the employees render the related service are recognized in 
respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected 
to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented as employee benefit obligations in the 
statement of financial position.

(o) Employee benefits (continued)  
 (ii) Termination benefits  
In accordance with the labor law in Turkey, the Company and its subsidiaries in Turkey are required to make 
lump -sum payments to employees who have completed one year of service and whose employment is 
terminated without cause or who retire, are called up for military service or die. Such payments  
are calculated based  on 30 days' pay up to a of maximum full TL 8.2 as at 31  December  2021   
(31 December 20 20: TL 7. 1), per year of employment at the rate of pay applicable at the date of retirement or 
termination. Termination benefits paid to key executive officers are presented as other expenses. Reserve for 
employee termination benefits is computed and reflected in the  consolidated financial statements on a current 
basis. Discount rate used for calculating employee termination benefit as of 31 December 202 1 is 2.9%  
(31 December 20 20: 3.0%). The reserve is calculated by estimating the present value of future probable 
obligation of the Company and its subsidiaries in Turkey arising from retirement of employees.  Reserve for 
employee termination benefits is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method.  
 (iii) Defined contribution plans  
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension 
insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations 
once the contribution s have been paid. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when 
they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in 
the future payments is available.  
(iv) Share -based payment s 
The Group provides a cash -settled share -based payment plan for selected employees in return for their services. 
For cash -settled share -based payment transactions, the Group measures services received and the liability 
incurred at the fair value of the li ability. Liabilities for cash -settled share -based payment plan are recognized 
as employee benefit expense over the relevant service period. The fair value of the liability is re -measured at 
each reporting date and at the settlement date. Any changes in fai r value are recognized in profit or loss for the 
period.  
(v) Personnel bonus  
Provision for bonus is provided when the bonus is a legal obligation, or past practice would make the bonus a 
constructive obligation and the Group is able to make a reliable est imate of the obligation.  
(p) Provisions  
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation.  
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement 
is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the 
likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.  
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the outflow required to settle 
the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value 
is a pre -tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of t ime is recognized as interest expense.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies  (continued)  
(p) Provisions  
Onerous contracts  
Present obligation arising under an onerous contract is recognized and measured as a provision. An onerous 
contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting 
the obligations under the contract exceed  the economic benefits expected to be received under it.  
Dismantling, removal and restoring sites obligation  
The Group is required to incur certain costs in respect of a liability to dismantle and remove assets and to 
restore sites on which the assets wer e located. The dismantling costs are calculated according to best estimate 
of future expected payments discounted at a pre -tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.  
 (q) Revenue  
Revenue is recognized at the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the performance obligation. 
The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for 
transferring promised goods  or services to a customer. Revenue is recognized when control is transferred to 
the customer.  
Revenue from telecommunication services includes postpaid and prepaid revenue from voice, data, messaging 
and value -added services, interconnect revenue, monthly  fixed fees, SIM card sales and roaming revenue. The 
Company transfers control of these service s over time and, therefore, satisfies the performance obligation s and 
recognizes revenue from telecommunication services over time.   
With respect to prepaid reve nue, the Group generally collects cash in advance by selling prepaid top up to 
distributors. In such cases, the Group does not recognize revenue until subscribers use the telecommunication 
services.  
Services may be bundled with other products and services  and these bundled elements involve consideration 
in the form of a fixed fee or a fixed fee coupled with a continuing payment stream. A good or service is distinct 
if both of the following criteria are met:  
• The good or service is capable of being distinct,    
• The promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract.  
The arrangement consideration is allocated to each performance obligation identified in the contract on a 
relative stand -alone selling price. If an element of a transaction is not a distinct, then it is accounted for as an 
integral part of the remaining elements of the transaction.  
Revenue from device sales is recognized when control of the device has transferred, being the time when 
delivered to the end customer.  For device sales made to intermediaries, revenue is recognized  at the time when 
control of the device has  been  transferred, being when the products are delivered to the intermediary . 
The Group, the distributors and dealers offer joint campaigns to the subscribers which may include the sale of 
device by the dealer and/or the distributor and the sale of communication service by the Group. In certain 
campaigns, dealers make the handset sale to the subscribers, the instalments of which will  be collected by the 
Group based on the letters of undertaking signed by the subscribers. With the letter of undertaking, the dealer 
assigns its receivables from handset sales to the distributor and the distributor assigns its receivables to the 
Group.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies  (continued)  
(q) Revenue (continued)  
The Group pays the distributor the net present value of the instalments to be collected from the subscribers and 
recognizes contracted receivables in its statement of financial position. The undue portion of assigned 
receivables from the distributors which  were paid upfront by the Group is classified as “undue assigned 
contracted receivables” in trade receivables (Note 20). When monthly installment is invoiced to the subscriber, 
related portion is presented as “receivables from subscribers”. The Group colle cts the contracted receivables 
in installments during the contract period and does not recognize any revenue for the handset in these 
transactions when the Group does not act as principal for the sale of handset.  
The Group and distributors started to offe r the option to buy a device through consumer financing  loan, which 
will be collected by Turkcell Finansman.  The Group carries a risk of collection in these transactions.  Turkcell 
Finansman collects the purchased credit from the subscriber during the contr act period and does not record 
revenue related to the device when it does not act as principal for the sale of device. Revenue from financial 
services comprise of interest income generated from consumer financing activities. Interest income is 
recognized a s it accrues, using the effective interest method.  
Monthly fixed fees represent a fixed amount charged to postpaid subscribers on a monthly basis without regard 
to the level of usage. Fixed fees are recognized on a monthly basis when billed. Monthly fixed fees are included 
in telecommunication services revenues.  
Call center revenues are recognized at the time services are rendered during the contractual period.  
When the Group sells goods or services as a principal, revenue and operating costs are recorded on a gross 
basis. When the Group sells goods or services as an agent, revenue and operating costs are recorded on a net 
basis, representing the net margin earned. Whether the Group is considered to be acting as principal or agent 
in the transactio n depends on management’s analysis described below and such judgments impact the amount 
of reported revenue and operating costs but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows:  
Indicators that an entity is a principal:  
• The entity is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service,  
• The entity has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a customer 
or after transfer of control to the customer,  
• The entity has di scretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.  
The Company and the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure of Turkey, Directorate General of 
Communications mutually agreed to extend the contract, to establish and operate mobile comm unication 
infrastructure and operation in uncovered areas, until 31 December 2021  and to add mobile broadband services 
to the existing infrastructure providing GSM services under Universal Service Law and to operate the new and 
existing networks together.  As of 31 December 202 1, the Company has recognized TL 252,049   
(31 December 20 20: TL 223,965 ) revenue from its operations related to this contract. Since the Company acts 
as principal, revenue and operating costs are reported on a gross basis in the consol idated financial statements.  
The revenue recognition policy for other revenues is to recognize revenue as services are provided.  
Contract costs eligible for capitalization as incremental costs of obtaining a contract comprise commission on 
sale relating to  prepaid and postpaid contracts with acquired or retained subscribers. Contract costs are 
capitalized in the month of service activation if the Group expects to recover those costs. Contract costs 
comprise sales commissions to dealers and t o own salesforce which can be directly attributed to an acquired 
or retained contract. Contract costs are classified as intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements. 
The asset is amortized on a straight -line basis over the customer lifetime, consis tent with the pattern of 
recognition of the associated revenue.   485 484

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  
 (r) Income taxes  
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax pay able on the current period’s taxable income based 
on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.  
Income tax expense is recog nized in the statement of profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respective ly. 
The current income tax charge is calculated based on the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end 
of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate 
taxable income. Management perio dically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in 
which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate based 
on amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.  Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability 
method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are  not recognized if they 
arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of 
the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using 
tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are 
expected to apply when the related de ferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is 
settled.  Deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available 
to utilize those temporary differences and tax losses.   
Deferred ta x liabilities and assets are not recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amount 
and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the Company is able to control the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences and it is prob able that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future.   
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the sa me taxation authority. Current tax assets and 
tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on 
a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.  
Companies within the Group may be entitled to claim special tax deductions for investments in qualifying 
assets or in relation to qualifying expenditure (e.g., the Research and Development Tax Incentive regime in 
Turkey or other investment allowances). The  Group accounts for such allowances as tax credits, which means 
that the allowance reduces income tax payable and current tax expense. A deferred tax asset is recognized for 
unclaimed tax credits that are carried forward as deferred tax assets.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  
(s) Earnings per share  
The Group does not have any potential ordinary shares in issue, therefore basic and diluted earnings per share 
(“EPS”) are equal. Since basic and diluted EPS are equal, the Group presents both basic and diluted EPS on 
one line described as “Basic and diluted EPS”.  
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the 
weight ed-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, excluding treasury shares. 
In Turkey, entities can increase their share capital by distributing “Bonus share” to shareholders from retained 
earnings. In computing earnings per shar e, such “Bonus share” distributions are treated as issued shares. 
Accordingly, the retrospective effect for such share distributions is taken into consideration when determining 
the weighted -average number of shares outstanding.  
(t) Government grants  
Grants from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 
grant will be received, and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.  
Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognized in profit or loss over the period necessary to 
match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.  Government grants relating to property, plant 
and equipment are included in non -current liabilities as deferred government grants, and are credited to profit 
or loss on a straight -line basis over the expected useful lives of the related assets.  
(u) Non-current asset s held for sale and discontinued operations  
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered  principally through 
a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and a sale is considered highly probable. They are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal.  
 An impairment loss is recognized for any i nitial or subsequent write -down of the asset to fair value less costs 
of disposal. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs of disposal of an asset, 
but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized . A gain or loss not previously 
recognized by the date of the sale of the non -current asset is recognized at the date of derecognition.  
An associate must meet the conditions to be classified as held for sale. It is first measured in accordance with 
applicable standards. Such standard is IAS 28, whereby the share of profits and remeasurement of carrying 
amounts are done in accordance with normal associate rules up to the point of classification as held for sale.  
The associate is then measured in accordance with IFRS 5. It is measured at the lower of carrying amount and 
fair value less costs of disposal. Equity accounting is ceased from the date the held for sale criteria are met.  
 Non-current assets classified as held for sale are presented separa tely from the other assets in the statement of 
financial position.  
 A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical are a of operations, is part of a single 
coordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired 
exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the 
stateme nt of profit or loss.  487 486

(v) Equity  
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares 
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.  
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity instruments, for example as the result of a 
share buy -back plan, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental c osts (net of 
income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the Company as treasury shares until 
the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any 
consideration received, net of any directl y attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the Company.  
(w) Dividends  
Provision is made for any dividend declared, being appropriately authorized and no longer at the  
discretion of the Company, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of

In case of events requiring correction after the reporting date, the Group corrects this new situation 
accordingly. Events that are not required to be adjusted subsequent to the reporting date are disclosed in 
the notes to the consolidated financial  statements.  
(y) Leases  
At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A contract is, or 
contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in excha nge for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset, The Group assesses whether:  
- The contract involved the use of an identified asset - this may be specified explicitly or implicitly;  
- The asset s hould be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically 
distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, the asset is not identified;  
- The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the econom ic benefits from the use of an asset 
throughout the period of use and  
- The Group has the right to direct use of the asset. The Group has the right when it has the  
decision -making rights that are most relevant to changing the how and for what purpose the a sset 
is used. If these decision s are predetermined;  
- The Group has the right to operate the asset or,  
- The Group designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it is 
used.  
At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the 
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand -alone prices.

(y) Leases  (continued)  
Right of use asset  
The Group recognizes a right -of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  
The right of use asset is initially recognized at cost comprising of:  
- Amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability , 
- Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received , 
- Any initial direct costs incurred by the Group and 
- An estimate of co sts to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, 
restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required 
by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are incurr ed to produce inventories. The 
lessee incurs the obligation for those costs either at the commencement date or as a consequence of 
having used the underlying asset during a particular period.  
The right -of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight -line method from the commencement 
date to the earlier of the end date of the useful life of the right -of-use asset or the end date of the lease 
term. The estimated useful lives of right -of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those property 
and equipment. In addition, the right -of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, 
and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability (Note 31).  
Lease Liabi lity  
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily 
determined, the Group’s incre mental borrowing rate. The Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as 
the discount rate.  
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:  
- Fixed payments, including in -substance fixed payments , 
- Variable lease pay ments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or 
rate as the commencement date , 
- Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and  
- The exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certa in to exercise, lease 
payments in an optional renewable period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension 
option, and penalties for early termination of a lease if the Group is reasonably certain to terminate 
early.  
After initial recognit ion, the lease liability is measured (a) increasing the carrying amount to reflect 
interest on lease liability; (b) reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made, and (c) 
remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or leas e modifications or to reflect revised 
in-substance fixed lease payments.  
Where, (a) there is a change in the lease term as a result of reassessment of certainty to exercise an 
extension option, or not to exercise a termination opt ion as discussed above; or (b) there is a change in 
the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, assessed considering the events and 
circumstances in the context of a purchase option, the Group remeasures the lease liabilities to reflect 
changes to lease payments by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. The 
Group determines the revised discount rate as the interest rate implicit in the lease for the remainder of 
the lease term, or the its incremental borrowin g rate at the date of reassessment, if the interest rate implicit 
in the lease cannot be readily determined.489 488

(y) Leases (continued)  
Lease Liability (continued)  
Where, (a) there is a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or 
(b) there is a change in the future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to 
determine those payments, including change to reflect chan ges in market rental rates following a market 
rent review, the Group remeasures the lease liabilities by discounting the revised lease payments using an 
unchanged discount rate, unless the change in lease payments results from a change in floating interest  
rates. In such case, the Group uses the revised discount rate that reflects changes in the interest rate.  
The Group recognizes the amount of the remeasurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the right of 
use asset. Where the carrying amount of the right of use asset is reduced zero and there is further reduction 
in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognizes any remaining amount of the 
remeasurement in profit or loss.  
The Group accounts for a lease modification as a separate lease if both:  
- The modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying 
assets and  
- -The consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand -alone price 
for the increase in scope and any appropriate adjustments to that stand -alone price to reflect the 
circumstances of the particular contract. 
The Group as a Lessor  
When the Group acts an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub -lease 
separately. It a ssesses the lease classification of a sub -lease with reference to the right -of-use-asset arising 
from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset.  
If an arrangement contains lease and non -lease components, the Group applies IFRS 15 to allocate the 
consideration in the contract.  
(z) New standards and interpretations  
i) Standards, amendments and interpretations applicable as at 31 December 202 1 
- Amendments to IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2; 
effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The Phase 2 amendments 
address issues that arise from the implementation of the reforms, including the replaceme nt of 
one benchmark with an alternative one. The Phase 2 amendments provide additional temporary 
reliefs from applying specific IAS 39 and IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements to hedging 
relationships directly affected by IBOR reform.  The Group has chosen early implementation of 
interest rate benchmark reform -Phase 2, and the alternative  benchmark will be used from 
beginning on 1 January 2022.  
-  
- Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts – deferral of IFRS 9; effective from annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. These amendments defer the date of application of 
IFRS 17 by two years to 1 January 2023 and change the fixed date of the tem porary exemption 
in IFRS 4 from applying IFRS 9, Financial instrument until 1 January 2023.

 2. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  
 (z) New standards and interpretations (continued)  
i) Standards, amendments and interpretations applicable as at 31 December 2021  (continued)  
- Amendment to IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ – Covid -19 related rent concessions Extension o f the Practical 
expedient ; as of March 20 21, this amendment extended till June 2022 and effective from 1 April 2021.As 
a result of the coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic, rent concessions have been granted to lessees. Such 
concessions might take a variety of forms, including payment holidays and def erral of lease payments. 
On 28 May 2020, the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 16 that provides an optional practical 
expedient for lessees from assessing whether a rent concession related to COVID -19 is a lease 
modification. Lessees can elect to account  for such rent concessions in the same way as they would if 
they were not lease modifications. In many cases, this will result in accounting for the concession as 
variable lease payments in the period(s) in which the event or condition that triggers the re duced payment 
occurs.  
ii) Standards, amendments and interpretations that are issued but not effective as at 31 December 202 1 
- IFRS 17, ‘Insurance contracts’; effective from annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2023. This standard replaces IFRS 4, which currently permits a wide variety of practices in 
accounting for insurance contracts. IFRS 17 will fundamentally change the accounting by all entities that 
issue insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features.  
 
- Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements’ on classification of liabilities; effective 
date deferred until accounting periods starting not earlier than 1 January 2024. These narrow -scope 
amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’, clarify that liabilities are classified as either 
current or non -current, depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting period. Cl assification 
is unaffected by the expectations of the entity or events after the reporting date (for example, the receipt 
of a waiver or a breach of covenant). The amendment also clarifies what IAS 1 means when it refers to 
the ‘settlement’ of a liability.  
 
- A number of narrow -scope amendments to IFRS 3, IAS  16, IAS 37 and some annual improvements 
on IFRS 1, IFRS  9, IAS 41 and IFRS 16; effective from Annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2022.  
  
Amendments to IFRS 3 , ‘Business combinations’ update a r eference in IFRS 3 to the Conceptual 
Framework for Financial Reporting without changing the accounting requirements for business 
combinations.  
 
Amendments to IAS 16 , ‘Property, plant and equipment’ prohibit a company from deducting from 
the cost of propert y, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced while the 
company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, a company will recognise such sales 
proceeds and related cost in profit or loss.  
 
Amendments to IAS 37 , ‘Provisions , contingent liabilities and contingent assets’ specify which costs 
a company includes when assessing whether a contract will be loss -making.  
 
Annual improvements make minor amendments to IFRS 1, ‘First -time Adoption of IFRS’, IFRS 9, 
‘Financial instruments’, IAS 41, ‘Agriculture’ and the Illustrative Examples accompanying IFRS 16, 
‘Leases’.

4. Financial risk management  
This note explains the Group’s exposure to financial risks and how these risks could affect the Group’s future 
financial performance. Current year profit and loss information has been included where relevant to add further 
context.  
The Group’s risk management policies are set to determi ne and analyze the risks faced, to establish the appropriate 
risk limits and to observe the commitment to those limits. These policies are constantly reviewed to make sure 
they reflect the Group’s operations and the changes in market conditions.  
Credit ris k 
At the reporting date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk is represented by the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, financial asset at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, fina ncial asset at amortize cost, derivative financial instruments,  contract assets,  trade 
receivables, receivables from financial services, due from related parties and other current and non -current assets 
(Note 3 7). 
Management has a credit policy in place an d the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. The 
Group may require collateral in respect of financial assets. Also, the Group may demand letters of guarantee from 
third parties related to certain projects or contracts. The Group may also  demand certain pledges from 
counterparties if necessary , in return for the credit support it gives related to certain financings (Note 20). 
In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to whether they are subscribers, financial 
services customers, other corporate customers and aging profile, maturity and existence of previous financial 
difficulties. Trade receivables and  contract assets  are mainly related to the Group’s subscribers. The Group’s 
exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and contract assets is influenced mainly by the individual payment 
characteristics of postpaid subscribers. The Group establishes a provision  for impairment losses based on its 
historical events and future expectations in respect of trade  receivables  and contract assets .  
Investments are preferred to be in liquid securities. The counterparty limits are set monthly depending on their 
ratings from the most credible rating agencies and the amount of their paid -in capital and/or shareholders equity. 
Policies are in place to review the paid -in capital and rating of counterparties periodically to ensure credit 
worthiness.  
The Group signs local a nd international derivate agreements in order to be able to execute financial derivative 
transactions with financial institutions that are believed to have sufficient credit ratings.   
The Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to subsidiaries and distributors. At 31  December  2021, 
guarantees of TL 3,914,303  were outstanding (31 December 20 20: TL 2,171,281 ). 493 492

 4. Financial risk management (continued)  
Liquidity risk  
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding through an 
adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to close out market positions. 
At the end of the reporting peri od the Group held demand deposits of TL 3,045,179  
(31 December 2020 : TL 975,753 ) that are expected to readily generate cash inflows for managing liquidity risk. 
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the Group Treasury maintains flexibility in funding by 
maintaining availability under committed credit lines.  
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve (Note 3 7) and cash and cash equivalents 
(Note 2 5) on the basis of expected cash flows. In addition, the Group’s liquidity management policy involves 
projecting cash flows in major currencies and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, 
monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements and m aintaining 
debt financing plans.  
Market risk  
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices 
affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The object ive of market risk 
management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the 
return on risk.  The Group uses derivatives in order to manage market risks. All such transactions are carried at within 
the guid elines set by the Group Treasury.  
(i) Foreign exchange risk  
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency 
transactions, primarily with respect to the USD, EUR and RMB. Foreign exchange risk arises from  recognized assets 
and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the relevant Group entity. The Group 
holds a significant portion of its cash and cash equivalent in foreign currencies in order to manage foreign exchange 
risk. In addition, derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange 
rates and since  1 July 2018 the Company applies hedge accounting. Details of the Company’s foreign exchange risk 
is disclosed in Note 3 7. 
(ii) Interest rate risk  
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is related to its financial assets and liabilities. The Group manage its 
financial liabilities by providing an appropriate distribution between fixed and floating rate loans. Floating rate 
expos ures can be changed to fixed rate exposures based on short term and long term market expectations via 
financial derivatives. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group Treasury’s policies approved by the 
Audit Committee, which provide writte n principles on the use of derivatives. The Group’s borrowings and 
receivables are carried at amortized cost. The borrowings are periodically contractually repriced (Note 3 7) and are 
also exposed to the risk of future changes in market interest rates.  
Effect of IBOR reform  
The reform and replacement of benchmark interest rates such as USD LIBOR and other interbank offered rates 
(‘IBORs’) has become a priority for global regulators. There are ongoing studies for these changes.  The Group’s 
risk exposure that is directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform is its  
USD 305,360 floating -rate debt. The Group has hedged this debt with participating cross currency , cross currency  
and interest swaps , and it has desig nated at participating cross currency swap in a cash flow hedge of the variability 
in cash flows of the debt, due to changes in 6 -month USD LIBOR that is the current benchmark interest rate  after 
the publication of Phase -2 in August 2020 . The nominal amoun t of the se derivative instruments is USD 290,997  
and th e nominal amount of the hedg ed part of these instruments is USD 183,425.

 4. Financial risk management (continued)  
Effect of IBOR reform  (continued)  
The Group treasury department oversees the Group’s USD LIBOR transition plan. This transition project will 
include changes to systems, processes, risk and valuation models, as well as managing related tax and accounting 
implications. The Group currently anticip ates that the areas of greatest change will be amendments to the contractual 
terms of  the USD LIBOR -referenced floating -rate debt and the participating cross currency swap  and updating hedge 
designations.  
Effect of IBOR reform – significant assumptions  
In calculating the change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk of  the floating -rate debt, the Group has made 
the following assumptions that reflect its current expectations:  
- The floating -rate debt will move to an alternative benchmark rate during 2 022, and the spread will be similar to 
the spread included in the participating cross currency swap used as the hedging instrument;  
- No other changes to the terms of the floating -rate debt are anticipated; and  
- The Group has incorporated the uncertainty over when the floating -rate debt will move to an alternative benchmark 
rate, the resulting adjustment to the spread, and the other aspects of the reform that have not yet been finalized by 
adding an additional spread to the discount rate used i n the calculation.  
5. Segment information

 10. Income tax expense (continued)  
In Turkey, there is no procedure for a final and definitive agreement on tax assessments. Companies file 
their tax returns by the end of the fourth month following the closing of the accounting year to which they 
relate. Corporate tax payment is made by the end of the month in which the tax return is filed. The tax 
authorities may, however, examine such returns and the underlying accounting records, and may revise 
assessments within a five -year p eriod. Advance tax returns are filed on a quarterly basis.  
In Turkey, the transfer pricing provisions have been stated under Article 13 of Corporate Tax Law with 
the heading of “disguised profit distribution via transfer pricing”. The General Communiqué on  disguised 
profit distribution via Transfer Pricing, dated 18 November 2007 sets out the details of implementation.  
If a taxpayer enters into transactions regarding the sale or purchase of goods and services with related 
parties, where the prices are not s et in accordance with arm's length principle, then related profits are 
considered to be distributed in a disguised manner through transfer pricing. Such disguised profit 
distributions through transfer pricing are not accepted as tax deductible for corporat e income tax purposes.  
The deduction of 100% of the research and development expenses is allowed when the taxpayers are 
made these expenditures exclusively for new technology and information researches.

foreign real persons are subject to 15% withholding tax. It is possible to apply reduced withholding tax 
rate for dividend payments made to abroad, under the scope of provisions of an applicable double taxati on 
treaty. On the other hand, dividend payments made to Turkish resident companies are not subject to 
withholding tax.  
Dividend income of Turkish taxpayers received from other Turkish taxpayers is exempted from corporate 
tax. However, dividends received f rom participation shares and stocks of fund and investment 
partnerships cannot utilize from this exemption.  
The earnings arising from the sale of founding shares, redeemed shares and priority rights, which the 
institutions have for at least two full years  in their assets are exempted from corporate tax for 75%. The 
earnings arising from the sale of immovables, which the institutions have for at least two full years in 
their assets are exempted from corporate tax for 50%. The e xempted earnings are transferr ed to another 
account in any way other than being added to the capital within five years or withdrawn from the business 
or taxes not accrued on time due to the exception applied for the part transferred to the head office by 
limited taxpayer institutions a re considered to be lost. The sales must be collected until the end of the 
second calendar year following the sale

assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.  
 It is expected that the obligations for dismantling, removing and site restoration will be realized in 
accordance with the useful life of GSM services materials.  
Additions to obligations for dismantling, removing and site restoration during the period are non -cash

Fair value of derivative instruments and risk management  
Fair value  
This section explains the judgments and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial 
instruments that are recognized and measured at fair value in the financial statements. To provide an 
indication of the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Group has c lassified its financial 
instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standards. An explanation of each level is 
as follows:  
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
entity can access at the measurement date;  
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly; and  
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the as set or liability.  
   
     
  Fair Value hierarchy   Valuation Techniques  
a) Participating cross currency swap 
contracts (*)   Level 3   Pricing models based on discounted 
cash Present value of the estimated 
future cash flows based on 
unobservable yield curves and end 
period FX rates  
b) FX swap, currency, interest swap and 
option contracts   Level 2  Present value of the estimated future 
cash flows based on observable yield 
curves and end period FX rates  
c) Currency forward contracts   Level 2 
 Forward exchange rates at the balance 
sheet date  
 
(*) Since the bid -ask spread is unobservable input; in the valuation of participating cross currency swap contracts, prices in the bid - 
ask price range that were considered the most appropriate were used instead of mid prices. If mid prices were used in the valuation 
the fair value of participating cross currency swap contracts would have been TL 253,788 lower as at 31 December 2021 (31 
December 2020: TL 168,882).  
There were no transf ers between fair value hierarchy levels during the year.  
As of 31 December 2021, the Company has no financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a non -
recurring basis.

Net off / Offset  
The Company signed a Credit Support Annex (CSA) against the default risk of parties in respect of a 
EUR 300,200  participating cross currency swap transaction executed on 15 July 2016 and restructured 
respectively on 26 May 2017 and 9 August 2018. Additionally, in the 25 June 2019, The Company signed 
a new CSA to EUR 40,020 participating cross currency swap transacti on. As per the CSA, the swap’s 
current (mark -to-market) value will be determined on the 10th and 24th calendar day of each calendar 
month, and if the mark -to-market value is positive and exceeds a certain threshold, the bank will be 
posting cash collateral  to the Company which will be equal to an amount exceeding the threshold (i.e. if 
the mark -to-market value is negative, the Company would be required to post collateral to the bank by an 
amount exceeding the threshold).  
With respect to valuations, on a bi -weekly basis, a transfer will take place between the parties only if the 
mark -to-market value changes by at least EUR 1,000. Following the execution of CSA, the bank 
transferred to the Company EUR 293,643 as collateral (31 December 2021: TL 4,430,104 ) whic h was the 
amount exceeding the threshold  (EUR 10,000)  and the Company transferred EUR 216,043  as collateral 
to the bank  (31 December 2021: TL 3,259 ,376) which was the amount exceeding the threshold  (EUR 
10,000) . The Company clarified this with the derivati ve assets included in the statement of financial 
position because it has the legal right to offset the collateral amount TL  1,170,728 (31 December 2020: 
1,121,303) that it recognizes under the borrowings and intends to pay according to the net fair value. This 
amount was netted from the borrowings and deducted from the derivative instruments in  the balance 
sheet. As of 3 1 December  2021, if this transaction was not conducted, derivative financial instruments 
assets , liabilities and borrowings  would ha ve been TL 3,167,73 6, TL (62,737)  and TL 10,019 ,141 
respectively . 
Market risk  
The Group uses various types of derivatives to manage market risks. All such transactions are carried out 
within the guidelines set by the treasury and risk management department. Generally, the Group seeks to 
apply hedge accounting to manage volatility in profit or loss.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

thousand currency units and are expressed in Turkish Liras unless otherwise stated. )

 36. Derivative financial instruments (continued)  
Fair value of derivative instruments and risk management (continued)  
Currency risk  
The Group’s risk management policy is to hedge its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of borrowing 
payments with various maturities at any point in time. The Group uses participating cross currency contracts to 
hedge i ts currency risk, mostly with a maturity of over one year from the reporting date. These contracts are generally 
designated as cash flow hedges.  
 
The Company started to apply hedge accounting as of 1 July 2018 for existing participating cross currency 
swap  and cross currency swap transactions in accordance with IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirement. The 
Group designates the hedge ratio, between the amount of the hedged item and the hedging instrument is 
1:1 to hedge its currency risk.  
 
The time value of optio ns in participating cross currency swap contracts are included in the designation 
of the hedging instrument and are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging, which is recognized in 
equity in a cost of hedging reserve. The Group’s policy is for the cri tical terms of the participating cross 
currency contracts to align with the hedged item.  
 
The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instruments and 
hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respe ctive cash flows. The Group assesses 
whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in 
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.  
 
In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are;  
- The effect of the counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the swap contracts, which is not part of 
the hedged risk and associated credit risk considered to be very low at inception in  the fair value of the 
hedged cash flows attributable to the change in exchange rates;  
 
- The entire fair value of the derivative contracts including currency basis was designated as the hedging 
instrument in cash flow hedge. The hypothetical derivative i s modelled to exclude the impact of currency 
basis.  
 
The Company’s future contracts are designated as hedging instruments against the spot foreign exchange 
rate risk (USD/TL) associated with highly probable device purchases. In this context, the Group started 
to apply cash flow hedge accounting effective from 23 December 2021.  The amount of forward currency 
contracts associated within this scope amounted to USD 10,131 as of 31 December 2021  Total net 
financial income after tax  recognised under “cash fl ow hedges” in the statement of other comprehensive 
income of 2021.  
 
The Company’s bank loans are designated as hedging instruments against the spot foreign exchange rate 
risk (USD/TL) associated with highly probable electricity sales. In this context, the Group started to apply 
cash flow hedge accounting effective from 10 September 2021. The amount of loans associated within 
this scope amounted to USD  16,987 as of 31 December 2021. The after tax foreign exchange loss 
recognised under “cash flow hedges” in t he statement of other comprehensive income of 2021.  
 
The Company’s lease liabilities are designated as hedging instruments against the spot foreign exchange 
rate risk (EUR/TL) associated with highly probable EUR telecommunication revenues. In this context,  
the Group started to apply cash flow hedge accounting effective from 1 October 2021. The amount of 
lease liabilities associated within this scope amounted to EUR 15,922 as of 31 December 2021. The after 
tax foreign exchange loss recognised under “cash flo w hedges” in the statement of other comprehensive 
income of 2021.  TURKCELL ILETISIM HIZMETLERI AS

 36. Derivative financial instruments (continued)  
Fair value of derivative instruments and risk management (continued)  
Currency risk  (continued)  
The Company designated EUR 245,758 of bank loan, as hedging instruments in order to hedge the foreign 
currency risk arising from the translation of net assets of the subsidiaries operating in Europe from EUR 
to Turkish Lira. Foreign exchange gains/losses of the relate d loans are recognized under equity as 
“gains/(losses) on net investment hedges” in order to offset the foreign exchange gains/(losses) arising 
from the translation of the net assets of investments in foreign operations to Turkish Lira. The after tax 
forei gn exchange loss recognised under “cash flow hedges” in the statement of other comprehensive 
income of 2021 in the scope of cash flow hedge amounted to TL 1,246,699 (2020: TL 296,275;  
2019: TL  43,203).  
Interest rate risk  
The Group adopts a policy of ensuri ng that its interest rate risk exposure is at a fixed rate. This is achieved 
partly by entering into fixed -rate instruments and partly by borrowing at a floating rate and using cross 
currency and interest rate swaps as hedges of the variability in cash flo ws attributable to movements in 
interest rates. The Group applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. 
The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and 
hedged item based on the reference interest rates, tenors, repricing d ates and maturities and the notional 
or par amounts.  
The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be 
effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative meth od. 
In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are:  
- The effect of the counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the swap contracts, which is not part of 
the hedged risk and associated credit risk considered to be very low at  inception in the fair value of the 
hedged cash flows attributable to the change in interest rates;  
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable -rate instruments  
A reasonable potential change of 100 basis points in interest rates and 10% change in foreign exchange 
currency at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) equity and profit or loss by the amounts 
shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

 Fair values  
Fair value of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a 
recurring basis  
This section explains the judgments and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial 
instruments that are recognized and measured at fair value in the financial statements . To provide an 
indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Group ha s classified its 
financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standards . An explanation of 
each level is as follows:  
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that t he 
entity can access at the measurement date;  
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and  
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability .TURKCELL ILETISIM HIZMETLERI AS

The Company’s subsidiaries of which, Lifecell, UkrTower, Global LLC and Paycell LLC provide 
telecommunications services, telecommunications infrastructure business, customer relations 
management and mobile payments services respectively in Ukraine.  As discl osed in Note 5, our Ukrainian 
operations account for approximately 8% of our net sales and 16% of our non -current assets for the year 
ended December 31, 2021 . With the start of the Russia -Ukraine war on 24 February 2022, uncertainties 
regarding the Group's  operations in Ukraine have emerged. Therefore, its impact on our operations has 
been monitored closely, and our corporate action plans regarding the continuation of operations and the 
safety and health of our employees have been updated instantly accordin g to developments. As of the date 
of publication of the consolidated financial statements, there has been no material damage and outage in 
the core network and around 10% of base stations temporarily down on average on daily basis due to 
energy cut -offs wh ereas around 60% of the stores are open nationwide on daily average as of the end of 
the March.  The portion of telecommunication equipment and revenue earned in the currently invaded 
region by Russia compared to our total telecommunication equipment and ou r total revenue earned in 
Ukraine is insignificant. Since the banking systems continue to operate within the country and liquidity 
is mostly kept at creditor banks, cash position is conducive to sustain the operations.   The Group 
management considers this invasion to be a non -adjusting post balance sheet event and according to the 
assessments of the Group management, the invasion does not have any effect on the ability of the going 
concern of the Group.  The Group has no way to predict the progress or outcom e of the situation as the 
conflict and government reactions are rapidly developing and beyond the Group’s control.  Prolonged 
unrest or military activities may impact  the Group’s financial condition, results of operations and cash 
flows.
