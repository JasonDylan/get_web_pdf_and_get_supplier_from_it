1SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL COMMUNITIES, 
FROM LOCAL TO GLOBAL
From the beginning, Qualcomm has been committed to supporting the communities in which our employees work and live. As Qualcomm grew, so did our community—from local to global—and with it, our sense of social stewardship solidified. This report highlights the many ways in which our community-focused culture 
manifests itself every day. Social responsibility is serious work (and play) at Qualcomm as we strive to better both our local and global communities through ethical business practices, socially empowering technology applications, educational and environmental programs, and employee diversity and volunteerism.
By consistently fostering a community-oriented, philanthropic 
culture, Qualcomm has often been recognized as a responsible, globally oriented corporate citizen. This will continue to be the backbone of our culture as we look forward to the next 20 years and beyond.

“Few companies are able to attain the level of teamwork and cooperation that 
employees of Qualcomm demonstrate. Employees at Qualcomm are very 
willing to help anyone in any way at any time.”
“I think the work environment is unique at Qualcomm. All employees treat 
each other with respect and try to help each other in reaching their goals. I can 
easily talk to my manager and other employees and they are very responsive. It is easier to work efficiently in a relaxed environment and a company that puts 
its trust in you to do your job.”
“Qualcomm ensures the satisfaction of its employees and makes it a very fun 
place to work by having various other supporting groups that help us in all 
sorts of ways. There is no other company that does that in our industry.”
“I truly believe that what makes Qualcomm stand out from other companies 
is the way our employees are treated. I believe that most of management 
has realized that a happy employee is a productive employee. Qualcomm is 
not only a company, but it is also a community where people interact on a 
human level.”
“Qualcomm makes every employee feel important and useful, giving us  
a sense of pride in our work. When I speak about the company I work for, 
I have a proud tone in my voice and I have noticed that this is the case with 
most of Qualcomm’s employees, regardless of what their titles may be.”
“Qualcomm has successfully created a culture that fosters employee 
participation and motivation. It’s truly amazing the benefits we’re offered, 
which gives us the comfort that our company cares about us. It is a pleasure to 
work for such a fine company.”
“What makes Qualcomm unique to work for is that Qualcomm provides the 
best environment possible for any employee to work in. I have the greatest 
respect for our leaders. Qualcomm hires people to do the right things and I 
would hate to ever have to think of working at any other place.”

STEW ARDSHIPEMPOWERING WOMEN IN THE  
SCIENCE COMMUNITY
From my childhood as a young girl interested in science to an 
engineering undergraduate in my home country of India to my post-graduate work here in the United States and now my career at 
Qualcomm, I realized there was a dearth of women engineers and 
scientists. I was always curious to know the reason why we made up such small numbers in the technical fields and, more importantly,  I wanted to find a solution to our lower representation. 
In an effort to foster confidence in 
female engineers and scientists of the 
future and to improve the success of those of us who have already started our careers, Angela McCourt and I came up with the idea for 
Qualcomm W omen in Science and 
Engineering (QWISE). QWISE was officially established in October 
2006, after several months of informal discussions that started with just two women and soon came to include the participation of 17 talented female engineers. Within one year, we have grown to nearly 
100 members. And, in fact, even though QWISE is an organization 
primarily focused on the professional development of women at Qualcomm, some of our biggest proponents are men who see the  
need to recruit more women in science and engineering.
The original motivation for QWISE was to provide a platform from 
which women engineers and scientists at Qualcomm could share information that would help each other in personal and professional development. However, what started as a deliberation about the low numbers of women in technology has culminated in an effort to aid Qualcomm as a whole. W e do this by working on various volunteer outreach programs to increase awareness among the 
younger generation of women about the numerous opportunities 
in sciences; actively recruiting more women in engineering; and, of course, developing and retaining the women engineers we have already with our internal mentoring and professional development programs. In addition to all that, we have a committee dedicated to social 
networking, to fill in any gaps not covered by our other activities.

Before joining Qualcomm,  
I was stressed out—working long hours, skipping exercise 
and finding comfort in food.  
It was not a formula for good health. After settling in here, I started 
taking advantage of QLife, Qualcomm’s work/life balance program, and my life has completely changed. 
It all started when I found out about a class that would teach me 
how to safely commute to work by bike. I bike to the train depot 
and then use the Qualcomm commuter subsidy to take the train and shuttle. Once I’m at work, I use the cool on-site bike storage room to keep my bike safe during the day and then take advantage of the gym facilities to get myself ready for work after my ride.  
I also take advantage of yoga classes and aerobic exercise 
equipment and use the company weight rooms. Since starting my self-prescribed program of healthy living at Qualcomm, I’ve lost 45 pounds and feel much more healthy and energetic. 
W e work hard here at Qualcomm—very hard—but we also 
have a culture that really supports us in maintaining a good, 
healthy balance between our work and personal lives. My job is demanding and requires that I put in a lot of hours, which can  be very stressful. But because Qualcomm has provided me with  a laptop computer, I can get work done almost anywhere without 
sacrificing my commitment to myself and the environment

T en employee bands and singers performed for over 6,000 
of their coworkers during the 2007 Qualcomm Summer on 
the Lawn (or QSOL, as it is better known) concert series in 
San Diego. Free lunch was provided to all attendees of the 
monthly Friday afternoon 
concerts and information 
was distributed about volunteer opportunities, cultural performances and 
health education.Qualcomm Rocks!
Held once a month during the 
summer season, QSOL takes place on the Qualcomm campus and gives 
employees the opportunity to enjoy 
great barbeque, sit in the sun, catch up with coworkers, and listen to great 
music. It also provides a great venue 
for fellow employees to show off their musical talents—where else can you 
see	a	patent	attorney	known	as	 “Kid

Said senior staff engineer Greg Breit, 
“ At QSOL 2007, my acoustic duo 
partner, Merle, and I had the pleasure 
of being the first act to ever perform on the new Morehouse Campus 
Lawn. W e had a great time playing 
for the large, appreciative audience, even though the crowd was 
more likely there for the 
free food than to hear us play. I think QSOL 
is one of the best 
social events put on by Qualcomm: it 
takes advantage 
of San Diego’s perfect summer 
climate, gives 
musically-inclined 
employees 
a chance to share their 
talents with their 
co-workers, and adds to the overall sense of 
employee community.”

A key part of being a successful technology 
company is being innovative and proactive, from the highest rungs of the company on down; we 
can’t just rest on our laurels. As an employee, I 
appreciate all of the learning and development opportunities provided to me by Qualcomm. This is truly a culture of constant learning, which is made very apparent by the wide variety of resources available through all sorts of 
channels—lectures, workshops, online. And, to 
ensure these resources don’t go to waste, all of us are encouraged to work with our managers to develop an Individual Development Plan (IDP) to identify career goals as well as the training and 
education needed to help us get there.
As part of my own IDP , I participated in an 
interactive workshop that addressed disruptive technologies. The workshop fostered a tremendous exchange of ideas among students 
through informal discussions and team 
presentations. The class helped me shift my thinking from reacting to problems as they arise to anticipating gaps in our markets where we can develop innovative, valuable solutions to 
our customers. I was then able to go back and 
share this refined perspective with my team, which then led us to identify a new development opportunity. Along with innovation-focused classes such as this one, I also regularly take advantage of the executive leadership courses offered by the Learning Center. This continuing 
education has been invaluable to me and I’m 
always impressed by the quality and quantity of learning opportunities so easily available to us here at Qualcomm.

STEW ARDSHIPFROM TRAFFIC JAM TO  
DISASTER PLAN
A few years ago, I was stuck in a horrendous traffic 
jam right by Qualcomm’s campus. It was shocking how much chaos was created by a simple traffic 
light malfunction. It made me wonder what would 
happen if there was a true emergency, like the very real possibility of  an earthquake. I looked around at all of the buildings belonging to Qualcomm and other local companies and realized we all needed to pull together—before a disaster—and 
figure out what we were going to do to take 
care of our employees. I contacted several other companies located in the same area of San Diego and we joined together to create the Sorrento V alley Consortium (SVC). W e have 10 member 
companies, including other technology firms, a few 
biotech organizations, local hospitals and the San Diego County Public Health Department. The consortium represents a combined estimated total of over 70,000 employees.
The consortium’s main goal is to create and 
implement a joint plan for a regional disaster in order to protect our employees and to keep critical business systems online. At monthly meetings, we share our individual company plans with each 
other, identify gaps and risks in them and discuss 
what we can do to close them. W e’ve established communication protocols and have trained and certified some of our employees together into Community Emergency Response T eams. Being part of the consortium helps Qualcomm extend our ability to respond in a regional disaster—we’re 
taking advantage of the power in numbers. 
Through the SVC, Qualcomm has committed explicitly to our consortium partner companies and implicitly to the surrounding community that we are well organized and prepared to help in the 
unfortunate event of a local disaster emergency.

email and SMS messages, and makes voice calls to find people 
regardless of location, at any time 
and on any device. It can deliver instructions, ask questions, collect 
responses and transfer recipients to 
a live representative or call bridge. 
Qualcomm is proud to be using 
the latest technology to ensure our 
employees are receiving the most up-
to-date information during a crisis. Maintaining Communications During a Crisis
On August 25, 2007, an unexpected blast interrupted 
a peaceful Saturday evening in Hyderabad, India. T wo bombs planted by terrorists had exploded at a 
crowded park and a popular eatery. With more than 
300 employees in the Hyderabad office, Qualcomm and its India Emergency Operations team were 
understandably concerned about employee safety. 
Using the recently implemented emergency notification 
system, AlertFind, the emergency team sent out 
notifications to find out if any employees were hurt or 
injured. Fortunately, no employees needed assistance. By using the AlertFind technology, Qualcomm was 
quickly assured of employees’ safety. Anil Jacob, 
international HR manager, said, “What was of paramount concern was to ascertain the safety and 
well being of our employees. With telephone networks 
clogged for a couple of hours, AlertFind’s multiple contact options helped us confirm the safety of 
our employees. The ability to reach out to a large 
employee base in a short time was extremely significant in the successful implementation of 
this tool. Investment in such systems is a clear 
differentiator and only re-emphasizes  that Qualcomm truly cares!”
The AlertFind notification that was 
sent that morning also notified the Corporate Emergency Operation T eam 
in San Diego. This timely notification 
allowed the San Diego team to offer up assistance and resources to the 
India	team. 	Says	Katie	 Wiest,	senior	
manager of operations, “W e were on 
the phone with the HR leads in the India offices within minutes of the 
AlertFind notification, asking how  
we could be of assistance to them. Without AlertFind, we might not 
have known about the bomb blasts for 
several hours.”

STEW ARDSHIPWHERE SCIENCE IS COOL AND 
SCIENTISTS ARE HEROES!
Back in March, I participated in the inaugural FIRST 
Robotics Competition, an event co-sponsored by Qualcomm that brought to San Diego 46 teams of 
high school students from all over the United States. 
The mission of FIRST (www.usfirst.org) reinforces a lot of my own beliefs about the importance of creating a society that values problem solving skills, a society where scientists are treated as heroes. 
With the goal of fostering kids’ interest in science and 
technology, each team was tasked with designing and building a robot within a six-week time frame, all using the same standard box of parts. Qualcomm and FIRST did a great job of infusing the competition with the 
same sense of excitement and spectacle that you get at a 
major league sporting event—no easy feat when you’re talking about a bunch of radio-controlled robots. 
I had a great time working with the kids. I think many 
of the students saw that they could work together 
with people very different from themselves and 
achieve something they could never do on their own. It was wonderful to know that the students had fun while using their science and engineering skills. The enthusiasm and energy they brought to the process was 
contagious and the competition itself was an edge-of-
your-seat experience. 
I think it’s great that Qualcomm supports events like 
this. It benefits both the company and the community at large when we find a fun way to foster these technical problem-solving skills in our youth. The competition 
made science “cool” for these kids. It was fun and 
rewarding and I would absolutely do it again.

STEW ARDSHIPOPENING NEW ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH 3G 
Many of history’s greatest entrepreneurs began with very little — they relied 
on their intuition, intelligence and initiative to seize opportunities. For today’s 
potential entrepreneurs in developing countries, 3G is an affordable tool that 
can help turn their dreams into a prosperous reality.
With 3G Internet access, people around the world from fishermen to Internet 
cafe owners can benefit from specialized wireless applications that allow them to access real-time data, which eliminates intermediaries and reduces costs. Store owners in a 
small village can lease a 
phone then sell telephony services to other villagers; 
farmers can access 
weather information; and a software developer 
can come up with the 
next ground-breaking application. What’s possible is only limited 
by entrepreneurs’ 
imaginations.

STEW ARDSHIPENHANCING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE THROUGH 3G 
Many countries are challenged when it comes to providing adequate 
health care to the majority of the population. Some of the difficulties faced 
include physical distance between doctors and their patients, a limited 
number of skilled health care professionals 
and the extraordinary costs of purchasing and maintaining health care equipment. Common 
problems in many urban centers include 
overcrowded hospitals, longer-than-average hospital stays and expensive medical transport.
3G solutions have proven to be effective 
in overcoming many of these challenges by bringing the latest medical 
intelligence to the patient 
and sending the latest patient 
information to the care provider. Nurses who are in real-time audio 
and video contact with doctors at 
the hospital can administer care from a patient’s home thereby 
allowing more people to enjoy 
better health as a result of regular checkups and early diagnosis. Wireless technology extends the 
reach of doctors.

STEW ARDSHIPGREEN CLEANING: UPSTAIRS,  
DOWNSTAIRS, INSIDE AND OUT
In March 2007, the Building Services team started using a new 
cleaning system, ManageMen®’s Operating System 1 (OS1)®, as part of our overall Green Cleaning Program. Everything about the 
new system is efficient, effective and much more environmentally 
friendly than our old products and methodology. As part of this new, systematic cleaning approach, we asked our attendants to change nearly everything about the way they did their job. While skeptical at first, they stepped up to the challenge, which made for a very successful transition and the results have been astonishing. 
W e reduced the number of cleaning products from 29 to just four 
and cut chemical use from 667 active cleaning units to just 12. W e also decreased the amount of chemical container waste we send to landfills by 97 percent and also reduced our annual water usage.  The new system uses a “top down” cleaning method where attendants 
move as a team from floor to floor, turning off lights as they go, 
which reduces use of electricity. Customer complaints have decreased by over 35 percent and, most importantly, we have implemented a system that greatly reduced the potential injury to employees by decreasing their exposure to harsh chemicals. 
Our cleaning staff now goes through a comprehensive, three-day 
training in order to effectively use the new system. During the pilot program, attendants offered several ideas for process improvement which have been implemented. The system was originally rolled out to five buildings but now we are up to 10 with the plan being 
to include all of our buildings in San Diego. W e are also currently 
discussing expanding to other regional locations as well. 
In addition to this new cleaning system, we have made many other 
green cleaning efforts. W e have reduced our paper towel consumption by 40 percent as a result of changing to microfiber cloths. W e now use a backpack vacuum that has been shown to reduce human effort 
to clean carpet by approximately 50 percent while being 43 percent 
more efficient than a commercial upright and 30 percent more efficient than a canister vacuum in removing soil. Outside, we have reduced our water consumption from 112,000 gallons to 14,000 per year by implementing a water efficient methodology for cleaning our 
courtyard, tennis, basketball and pool deck area.

“For example, a U.S. Navy report says 
the summer north polar ice cap could be completely gone within seven years. If ice that far north disappears, what happens to the snow further south that creates our drinking water? The dramatic picture of Lake Mead with only 48 percent of its  water left (after eight years of sparse snowfall) on the front page of the  December 11 San Diego Union Tribune made me wonder if there’s a connection.” 
Chris attended an event that 
compared what was factually happening in regards to the climate and what was actually aired or written about in the media. The disparities were obvious, almost painful, for Chris. “T o me, communication is the key. If people can learn to connect the scientists’ warnings with their real lives, they will take action to save our civilization.”

Program, all IC packages are designed with 
bromine-free mold compounds. By designing with 
bromine-free mold compounds, we have reduced 
the bromine content in our Mobile Station Modem™ products by 
over 70 percent. Our goal is to design all IC packages bromine-free 
and chlorine-free beginning January 2009.
