The 2014 Corporate Social Responsibility Report for EQT Corporation (EQT or “the Company”) is presented in accordance 
with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines 3.1 and the Oil and Gas Sector Supplement (OGSS). GRI standards and 
technical protocols were used to determine the materiality of data, the methods for reporting that data, and the validation 
of completeness. Internal risk assessment, benchmarking, and gap analysis helped decide which sustainability topics were 
most relevant to EQT and its stakeholders.
The current report covers activity at EQT headquarters and the Company’s two business segments — Production and 
Midstream — for the period January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013. The domain of this report does not include 
operational activity at Equitable Gas Company, which EQT sold in 2013; however EQT’s ownership interest in this entity 
is reﬂ ected in all reported 2013 ﬁ  nancial data for the Company, including economic impact analyses. Also excluded 
from this report are the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, which are either inactive or in the process of winding down. 
Most quantitative data provided is derived from direct measurements. Where actual data is not available, appropriate 
estimates and calculations may be used following industry or internationally recognized standards. Based on GRI 3.1/OGSS 
guidelines, EQT self-declares that this report meets the requirements of GRI Application Level B.
This report addresses the sustainability concerns and expectations that EQT’s diverse stakeholder groups have regarding 
the processes used to extract natural gas, as well as the steps EQT takes to ensure safety and protect the environment. 
With this in mind, the Company’s commitment to community goes beyond creating new jobs and stimulating economic 
growth. EQT recognizes its responsibility to openly and honestly identify and answer questions about its operations.
The design of EQT’s Corporate Social Responsibility report speaks to the predominant interests of internal and external 
stakeholders. For this reason, the Company continues to evolve its outreach efforts, monitor feedback, and adjust the 
materiality assessment as needed. The publication of this report is one of many ways that EQT remains accountable to 
its stakeholders, and demonstrates that sustainability is transparent and integrated into every aspect of its business.

Message from the CEO
Dear Stakeholders,
Innovation is woven in the fabric that created EQT Corporation. It’s what launched this Company from drilling our ﬁ  rst 
natural gas well more than a century ago, all the way to what makes us who we are today — a thriving, forward-thinking 
energy leader molded by hard work, integrity and, above all, a commitment to safety in all we do each and every day. 
We respect our stakeholder audiences and are committed to addressing their concerns regarding how our operations 
may impact the environment and our neighbors. In fact, many of our neighbors are also EQT employees who take pride 
in conducting our business with integrity. That’s why all of us at EQT are dedicated to protecting the environment we 
share, maintaining the health and safety of our employees, and preserving the surrounding land and neighborhoods. 
Innovation drives EQT’s successes and fuels the Company’s longevity. We’re always looking for better ways to drill 
wells, reduce emissions, or transport natural gas while planning for new and sustainable ways to grow our business, 
our industry and our communities. When you read our 2014 Corporate Social Responsibility report, you’ll learn how 
“green completions” are reducing the need for gas ﬂ  ares before a well can begin producing; how drilling rigs are 
now being powered by “ﬁ  eld” gas instead of diesel, lowering emissions and reducing noise and truck trafﬁ  c; and 
how we’re improving the ﬂ  uids we use for hydraulic fracturing by recycling and re-using water from completed wells 
to drill new wells. 
The dynamic growth of the natural gas industry from its birth in the 1800s through today has brought both successes 
and challenges to our communities, and to our country. As a partner through it all, EQT knows that safe and responsible 
development is as important to you as it is to us. That is why integrating our efforts to manage the internal and external 
sustainability impacts of our work is such a vital part of our business model. It is also why we prepare reports like this one,  
to openly share our performance with you — our stakeholders.

7864_Text_C4.indd   4 8/29/14   1:10 PMCorporate Structure
EQT ended 2013 with more than 1,600 employees 
working in Pennsylvania (PA), West Virginia (WV), Ohio 
(OH), Kentucky (KY), and Virginia (VA) through two primary 
operating segments: Production and Midstream.    
The Production segment is one of the largest natural gas 
producers in the Appalachian Basin, with 8.3 trillion cubic 
feet equivalent (Tcfe) of proved natural gas and crude oil 
reserves across approximately 3.6 million gross acres; about 
580,000 of those gross acres are located in the Marcellus 
Shale play. In May 2013, EQT achieved a major milestone 
when Production set a Company record for natural gas 
production of one billion cubic feet per day.   
The Midstream segment is seizing opportunities created 
by the Appalachian Basin’s growing production of natural 
gas and other energy products. With approximately 10,400 
miles of gathering and transmission pipeline, 1,500 million 
cubic feet of gathering capacity per day, and 47 billion 
cubic feet of working gas storage capacity, EQT is building 
and operating the infrastructure needed to deliver clean-
burning natural gas throughout the Northeast and other 
areas of the United States. EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) is a Standard & Poor’s 
500 investor-owned corporation, headquartered in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and operating primarily in 
the United States. EQT’s role in the natural gas industry 
originated more than 125 years ago with the formation 
of the Equitable Gas Company by renowned inventor 
and businessman George Westinghouse. As the natural 
gas sector — and the broader energy industry — 
changed, the Company expanded and grew into the 
entity now known as EQT Corporation.Governance
EQT’s corporate governance policies and practices are 
compliant with all applicable corporate governance 
requirements and are overseen by the Board of Directors 
(Board), the top governing body of the Company. The 
Audit Committee, for example, oversees the Company’s 
compliance program as set forth in its charter. The Public 
Policy and Corporate Responsibility Committee (PPCR) 
provides oversight of and makes recommendations 
regarding the Company’s social, environmental, health 
and safety policies, and other sustainability matters 
similarly enumerated in its charter. The PPCR Committee 
meets as needed (on average, four times per year) to 
assess the Company’s performance and make procedural 
improvement recommendations to EQT management 
and its Board. The frequency of this and other Board 
committee meetings can be found in the Company’s 
annual Proxy Statement. 
EQT maintains a corporate governance page on its external 
website, which includes key information regarding its 
corporate governance practices — including its corporate 
governance guidelines, code of business conduct and About EQT

7864_Text_C4.indd   5 8/29/14   1:10 PMGo back to Table of ContentsIntegrated Sustainability
After more than 125 years as an integrated energy 
company, EQT has developed a keen understanding of the 
industry, giving it a unique perspective on the past, present 
and future of natural gas production. EQT’s contributions 
to the development of innovative technologies, coupled 
with industry leading standards for integrated sustainability, 
perfectly balance the needs and concerns of a very diverse 
community of stakeholders with the obligations of 
the Company.      These initiatives help establish trust and demonstrate 
awareness of and sensitivity towards how the Company’s 
core activities directly affect the lives and livelihoods of 
thousands of people. EQT rarely labels these efforts as 
“sustainability,” but they are thoroughly integrated into the 
corporate responsibility goals of the business model and 
play a key role in assuring that EQT operates responsibly 
in regard to the economic, environmental, and social 
implications of its actions. 
EQT works hard to maintain its reputation as a company 
built on safety, integrity, accountability, and transparency; 
its employees know instinctively that these are the most 
important pillars of the business. During 2013, a number 
of initiatives were launched to help employees understand 
and communicate these core principles, starting with the 
Company’s revision of its Environment, Health and Safety 
policy. Employees received consistent afﬁ  rmation that safety 
is truly a core value at EQT through local safety meetings, 
as well as direct mail outreach from the CEO. 
In 2014 and beyond, the Company intends to publicly 
communicate more of its core operating standards and its 
mission and vision statements. With sustainability at the 
heart of everything EQT does, the Company’s strategies 
for organizational success (current, near-term and long-
term) also are guided by its intrinsic values. Articulating 
these to internal and external audiences helps demonstrate 
EQT’s awareness and understanding of what matters most 
to its stakeholders. Monitoring activities in these areas, 
and following established procedures to continuously 
evaluate operations, identify areas for improvement, and 
ensure compliance with regulatory policies, will increase 
transparency and build trust by expanding public awareness 
of the Company’s performance. Executive Independent Total

7864_Text_C4.indd   8 8/29/14   1:10 PMAll EQT employees are expected to take direct responsibility 
for maintaining an accident-free working environment. 
The Company provides employees with the training and 
support needed to integrate superior health and safety 
principles into their work, no matter what they do or where 
they do it. Contractors working for EQT are expected to 
provide a similar level of commitment to their employees, 
and those of their subcontractors, and the Company has 
implemented programs to ensure that happens. EQT is also 
committed to the safety of those who live and work near 
the Company’s operations. EQT’s long-standing success in the natural gas industry 
is a direct result of its refusal to compromise safety to 
gain a business advantage. That means providing every 
EQT employee, and employees of its contractors, with 
a safe and healthy workplace. It also means focusing 
on continuous improvement to create and maintain 
a zero-injury culture.    AND COMMITS TO CONTINUOUS  
IMPROVEMENT.WE ARE A COMPANY 
THAT PROMOTES A  
CULTURE OF SAFETY 
Workplace Safety
For EQT employees, safety training is ongoing throughout 
their careers, and they are encouraged to share their 
knowledge and experiences with family and friends to 
help extend the culture of safety into their communities. 
The frequency, type, and delivery method of training may 
change based on the work performed and the issues 
faced on a daily basis.    
For example, ﬁ  eld employees participate in monthly 
workplace safety meetings because of the large and 
varied number of situations they may face on a job site. 
In 2013, these employees received comprehensive 
training in a number of circumstances common to their 
work activities.  
Driving is a major activity for most of the Company’s 
employees and contractors, so EQT instituted initiatives to 
improve trafﬁ  c safety, including web-based and behind-the-
wheel driver training for employees, safe driver initiatives, 
speed restrictions, vehicle curfews for contractor trafﬁ  c, 
enhanced policies concerning the use of electronic devices 
while driving, and enhanced monitoring and enforcement.  
Performance monitoring is another critical element of EQT’s 
safety program; besides highlighting actual results, it also 
identiﬁ  es opportunities for improvement. EQT experienced 
a slight increase in its lost time accident (LTA) rate compared 
to previous years. The 2013 LTA rate was 0.39 incidents per 
every 200,000 person-hours worked compared to a rate of 
0.34 in 2012. Although the reasons behind each incident 
vary, and the Company’s performance is still signiﬁ  cantly 
below the industry average, studying the cause of each 
injury, and the ongoing quest for zero injuries, inﬂ  uences 
initiatives to improve performance in future years.

EQT, and all its contractors and their subcontractors, are 
required to follow state and federal requirements for 
providing a safe and healthy workplace for employees.  
The specialized nature of EQT’s ﬁ  eld operations requires 
the use of numerous vendors to perform each aspect of 
work, sometimes simultaneously. In addition to keeping 
its own workers safe, EQT insists that every vendor 
performing work at one of its facilities maintains the 
same high standards for workplace safety.    
Companies that expect to perform contract services in 
the areas of drilling, construction, maintenance, and 
operations must agree to adhere to the EQT Contractor 
Safety Program and its companion, Contractor Safe 
Work Rules. The rules and standards apply to all work 
performed by the employees of the contractor, as well as 
those of their subcontractors and agents. These include:
 Development and implementation of safety policies 
and procedures that are in compliance with all 
applicable regulations, laws, and standards for the 
contractor’s employees, subcontractors, and agents
 Performance of all necessary audits and inspections of 
the worksite and relevant premises as often as needed 
to ascertain whether any conditions, including those 
created by work performed by the contractors or 
others, may pose hazards to the contractor or others
 Assurance that all employees and subcontracted 
employees of the contractor have the necessary 
training, skills, certiﬁ  cations, tools and equipment 
to complete the job safely and in compliance with 
regulations
 Maintenance of a safe, healthy, and clean work 
environment
 Assurance that daily Tailgate Safety Meetings 
or similar discussions on the tasks performed that 
day and any relevant safety precautions are conducted 
and documented
 Provision of a “Competent Person” as deﬁ  ned and 
required by OSHA, who possesses the ability to 
recognize hazards on the jobsite and also has the 
authority to correct those hazards.  Each contractor 
is required to designate a Competent Person at 
every work location who is familiar with the site-
speciﬁ  c hazards
 Investigation and reporting of all injuries, incidents 
with property damage, and near-missesIn 2013, EQT began transitioning its contractor safety pre-
qualiﬁ  cation procedures to a third-party contractor/supplier 
information management system. The ISNetworld database 
expands the Company’s ability to consistently monitor key 
performance indicators for current contractors, and verify 
contractor safety program documentation before qualifying 
a new contractor to work for EQT. Many of EQT’s current 
suppliers had already subscribed to ISNetworld; those that 
had not were required to become subscribers before they 
could continue to perform services for EQT.
First Responders
As EQT identiﬁ  es ways to improve its response to safety 
related incidents in the ﬁ  eld, the Company routinely shares 
this new knowledge with local emergency responders, 
who in some cases may be ﬁ  rst on the scene. The shared 
knowledge helps these agencies become effective partners 
in maintaining a safe environment for all.    
For example, EQT’s Well Site Awareness program provides 
emergency responders a greater level of awareness 
regarding operations at a well site, and of what they can 
expect from EQT should an incident occur. The attendees 
develop a better understanding of what they should, and 
should not, do in different scenarios and whom to contact 
in various situations. They also are then better equipped 
to respond to local inquiries and concerns in the event 
of an incident.
School Zones
An important concern of EQT’s stakeholders is the increase 
in operations-related truck trafﬁ  c on local roads shared with 
school buses in suburban and more densely populated rural 
areas. In 2013, with the support and cooperation of local 
school districts as well as neighbors and elected ofﬁ  cials, 
EQT implemented a school zone curfew program for truck 
trafﬁ c near, or in route to, EQT jobsites. The Company 
placed signs along active truck routes in Pennsylvania, 
West Virginia, and Ohio, notifying its drivers, and those 
of its contractors, that truck travel along these routes is 
prohibited during the posted hours when school buses 
are picking up and dropping off students. EQT actively 
monitors employee and contractor adherence to the 
curfews, and promptly addresses reported violations of 
these posted curfews.   Safety

 STEWARDSHIP
7864_Text_C4.indd   12 8/29/14   1:10 PMEQT is committed to conducting business in a 
sustainable and environmentally responsible manner 
at all times, striving to preserve and protect the land, 
air and water near all business operations. These 
efforts contribute to EQT’s long-standing reputation 
as a responsible operator.   
Respecting the rights and expectations of interested 
stakeholders is important, so EQT works to protect natural 
resources during the many phases of the Company’s 
development and operating processes. In addition, WE ARE A COMPANY 
THAT ROUTINELY IMPOSES THEEQT is subject to an extensive list of federal, state and 
local regulations relating to environmental protection, 
including air quality, water conservation and land 
reclamation. The Company actively works to meet or 
exceed all applicable regulations.
Putting safeguards in place that allow EQT to respond 
quickly and effectively to an unexpected event is 
embedded in the Company’s operating strategy. 
So is the continuous monitoring of its own experiences, 
and those of its counterparts in the industry, enabling 
EQT to make continuous process improvements that 
mirror the best practices in the industry.    
Protecting the Appalachian Basin
EQT’s Marcellus Operations Guiding Principles, adopted 
several years ago, are just one example of protocols 
established by the Company to infuse sustainability 
and achieve operational excellence in its drilling 
operations in the vast Marcellus Shale play.  
To further support responsible natural gas development 
in the Appalachian Basin, EQT became a founding member
13Environmental Stewardship
MARCELLUS OPERATIONS GUIDING PRINCIPLES
FLAMMABLE 
ATMOSPHERESNatural gas encountered during the drilling process is vented away from the work area. 
During completions and ﬂ  owback, ﬂ  ammable zones are established in areas where natural gas 
will be vented. Natural gas liquids produced during ﬂ  owback are stored in ﬂ  ammable zones 
during ﬂ  owback and removed after ﬂ  owback.
HIGH PRESSURE 
SYSTEMSAll equipment and components used in pressurized systems are appropriately rated and capable 
of operating under the maximum rated pressure. High pressure pumps and equipment are only 
used when necessary and appropriate for the task, and are routinely tested for integrity.
PIT DESIGN 
AND OPERATIONPrior to construction, potential pit locations are evaluated to establish suitability. Pits are 
engineered and designed to be stable and impervious, and are inspected to establish that they 
are constructed as designed. Inspections are conducted regularly to evaluate pit integrity.
WELL CONTROL EQT maintains a minimum of two barriers at all times between the open producing formation 
and the atmosphere. A responsible person with a well-control certiﬁ  cation from an accredited 
training program is on-site during drilling and completions. Blowout preventers are tested 
prior to being placed into service, and remote actuators are maintained away from the rig and 
not tied to the rig hydraulic system.
WELL DESIGN 
AND 
CONSTRUCTIONWells are designed to protect fresh groundwater and prevent methane migration. Surface casing 
is installed and the void outside of the casing is ﬁ  lled with cement. If cement circulation to the 
surface is not possible for the surface casing, EQT installs baskets at appropriate depths and then 
grouts the annulus to the surface to create a barrier between subsurface zones.
7864_Text_C4.indd   13 8/29/14   1:10 PMGo back to Table of ContentsGo back to Table of ContentsGo back to Table of Contentsof the Center for Sustainable Shale Development 
(CSSD), which was launched in early 2013. The CSSD, 
an independent coalition of foundations, environmental 
organizations and energy companies, promotes 
collaborative efforts by industry and its stakeholders as 
called for by the Shale Gas Production Subcommittee 
of the U.S. Secretary of Energy’s Advisory Board.
The CSSD developed 15 initial performance standards 
for operators, representing industry best practices that 
are protective of air quality, water resources, and climate.  
These standards represent consensus on what is achievable 
and protective of human health and the environment.  
Arising from these standards is CSSD’s independent, third-
party certiﬁ  cation and veriﬁ  cation program. Companies can 
seek certiﬁ  cations in Air and Climate, Water and Waste, or 
both, concurrently. As a strategic partner of CSSD, EQT is 
evaluating its current practices and expects to apply for Air 
and Climate certiﬁ  cation in 2014. EQT is currently reviewing 
the Water and Waste certiﬁ  cation standards against its 
operations to determine a schedule for certiﬁ  cation but 
has not yet reached a decision on a date for application.
Additional information about CSSD, the performance 
standards, and the certiﬁ  cation process can be found at 
sustainableshale.org . 
Managing Water Resources
Water plays a major role in the successful creation of a 
producing natural gas well, and EQT is committed to 
managing its use of this environmental resource in a 
responsible way so that no water sources are signiﬁ  cantly 
affected by the Company’s activity.  
Water Withdrawals 
EQT obtains nearly 100% of the fresh water used for 
production activities from surface water, municipal water, 
or groundwater sources. Strict adherence to all water 
withdrawal regulations in the states where EQT operates 
ensures that withdrawal from a water source does not 
adversely affect the ecological and recreational uses of that 
source. This is accomplished by installing and monitoring 
Company placed stream gauges, monitoring existing 
U.S. Geological Survey stream gauges, and using online 
water withdrawal tools when available. Full compliance with 
established regulations eliminates the need for EQT to establish 
a separate water withdrawal or consumption threshold.The ability to withdraw surface water in a given year 
is largely seasonal and often heavily controlled by the 
location and timing of completions operations. The volume 
of surface water  withdrawn by EQT in 2013 increased 
signiﬁ  cantly from 2012 totals. This was due to a combination 
of more wells completed (94 in 2012 vs 139 in 2013) and 
slightly larger water volumes associated with each well 
(166,414 bbls/well in 2012 vs 171,228 bbls/well in 2013) 
as the Company increased the length of laterals.   
The volume of ground water  withdrawn in 2013, although 
a relatively small percentage compared to overall water 
withdrawals, increased 88% from the 2012 requirement.  
This was due to an increased focus on drilling operations 
in northern West Virginia, near areas where the Company 
developed groundwater supply wells. The entire volume of 
groundwater was pumped from four separate groundwater 
supply wells operated by EQT (one in Pennsylvania and three 
in West Virginia). The increase in northern West Virginia 
operations also resulted in a 25% decrease in municipal 
water withdrawals because of limited access to municipal 
water supply near current well sites.
EQT’s water management goal is to routinely collect nearly 
100% of the water that ﬂ  ows back from completed wells 
and then reuse that water to produce new wells at other 
sites. During 2013, EQT recycled 823,778 m3 of wastewater 
from ﬂ  owback water, ﬁ  ltered drilling water, and produced 
water. This represents a continuing increase in water reuse 
over previous years due to dedicated efforts to recycle 
wastewater from the Company’s drilling activity. 
Although the total volume of recycled water increased, the 
concurrent increase in total water withdrawals during 2013 
caused the Company’s total recycled-to-withdrawn rate to 
drop to 22%, down from the 2012 result of 32%.
  
Disposition of Produced Water 
In 2013, EQT reused 4.6 million barrels of ﬂ  owback water, 
drill pit liquids, and production ﬂ  uids from its Marcellus 
and Utica drilling completions. When water is no longer 
suitable for recycling or production purposes, EQT sends 
the water to state and federally permitted underground 
injection facilities for safe disposal.

7864_Text_C4.indd   15 8/29/14   1:10 PMGo back to Table of ContentsProtecting Drinking Water 
Producing natural gas is a water-intensive process, but 
most of it occurs underground, miles below the surface. As 
awareness of the process increases, so does the interest in, 
and questions about, the impact of gas extraction processes 
on drinking water. EQT takes great care to protect these 
resources, and is transparent about the steps taken to make 
sure the water near its operations is safe to drink and use.      
EQT begins with the establishment of a water quality 
baseline by sampling nearby groundwater sources before 
starting any operational activities, including drilling. Any 
pre-existing conditions are reviewed.      
Once drilling begins, EQT uses multiple layers of steel and 
cement casings to isolate freshwater sources from the 
drilling process. The legally required standard of using at 
least three layers of steel and cement — known as triple 
casing — ensures that nothing used to stimulate the ﬂ  ow 
of natural gas from the well can migrate into the drinking 
water supplies. In some cases, EQT may re-sample local 
water sources after the well is drilled.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Freshwater aquifers, the source for drinking water in many 
rural locations, sit just a few hundred feet below the earth’s 
surface. The process of hydraulic fracturing, on the other 
hand, occurs several thousand feet below ground level, 
far below any freshwater zone. Risk posed to surface or 
groundwater resources tends to lie in surface operations 
rather than the hydraulic fracturing process itself. EQT 
accordingly goes to great lengths to manage and control 
liquids at the surface, thereby reducing the risk of any 
releases or adverse impact on water resources.   
EQT conducts hydraulic fracturing in accordance with state 
regulations using water recycled from previously fractured 
wells or obtained from freshwater sources. This water is mixed 
with sand and a small percentage of chemical additives.    
The fracturing ﬂ  uid is injected under controlled high 
pressure into triple-cased wells designed to prevent any 
effect on ground or surface water. The pressure breaks 
open and expands the targeted rock formation, and the 
sand particles hold the fractures open, allowing natural 
gas to ﬂ  ow to the well head. EQT is committed to operational transparency and was 
one of the ﬁ  rst natural gas producers in Appalachia to 
voluntarily disclose the actual content of the hydraulic 
fracturing ﬂ  uid used at each of its well sites. This information 
is published on the Company’s website, EQT.com .   
EQT is also a charter participant on FracFocus.org , an 
independent educational website created by the Ground 
Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas 
Compact Commission. This website provides information 
to help stakeholders understand the additives in the water 
being used for natural gas development in their own 
communities. On both the EQT and FracFocus websites, the 
Company’s postings disclose the general mixture amounts 
of the ﬂ  uid, and also explain the speciﬁ  c use of each 
chemical additive. 
The hydraulic fracturing ﬂ  uids EQT currently uses in 
its Marcellus operations do not contain additives with 
diesel carriers. In addition, traditional biocides in EQT’s 
Marcellus fracturing ﬂ  uids have been replaced by non-toxic 
substitutes. The Company has signiﬁ  cantly reduced the 
amount of other chemicals being used during hydraulic 
fracturing:
 Traditional biocides have been replaced with a variety 
of environmentally friendly, non-chemical alternatives
 Acid utilization has been reduced by approximately 50%
 Improved friction-reducing products have 
allowed the quantity of this chemical used to be 
signiﬁ  cantly reduced
16
7864_Text_C4.indd   16 8/29/14   1:10 PMGo back to Table of ContentsWaste Disposal
EQT employs the most efﬁ  cient, environmentally responsible 
and cost-effective disposal methods possible.  The Company 
reuses (or sells as a usable product) materials such as ﬂ owback 
ﬂ uid and condensate, whenever possible. Those materials 
that cannot be reused or sold are disposed of at permitted 
injection wells, landﬁ  ll facilities, and treatment facilities. 
Liquid Waste
EQT disposed of 1,222,249 barrels of ﬂ  owback, drill pit, 
and production ﬂ  uid from Marcellus/Utica operations and 
960,487 barrels of production ﬂ  uid from conventional 
operations in injection wells. In addition, 258 tons of 
hazardous waste liquids (from midstream compressor 
stations and ﬂ  uids associated with drilling and completions) 
were sent to approved treatment facilities for disposal.  
Solid Drilling Waste
Drilling waste, consisting of drill mud and cuttings, is 
processed through solids control equipment to efﬁ  ciently 
separate the drilling ﬂ  uids from the drill cuttings. For 2013, 
76.4% of the wells drilled by EQT were completed using 
closed loop systems (Marcellus – 100%; Utica – 57.1%; 
Lower Huron – 0%). The residual moisture of the drilling 
ﬂ uid left on the drill cuttings themselves is further dried 
using drying agents/mix off materials. The dried cuttings are 
then loaded into containers to be transported to landﬁ  lls 
that accept preapproved drill cuttings in their permitted 
disposal cells. EQT continues to improve the efﬁ  ciency of 
the solids control equipment used at its locations. These 
higher efﬁ  ciency systems create better separation of drilling 
ﬂ uid and drill cuttings, which in turn will reduce the overall 
weight of the disposed product. Also, by utilizing fewer and 
more effective drying agents, the disposed product has a 
minimal amount of additional drying agent weight.
EQT currently tracks waste volumes and disposal for 
landﬁ lls, routine operations, and other activities on a 
project-by-project basis. The Company continues to 
explore more detailed reporting data collection systems.  
Hazardous wastes relating to the following operations 
are not applicable to EQT:
 Composting
 Recycling
 Recovery
 Incineration or use as fuel
 On-site storage

Radioactive Waste
EQT manages naturally occurring radioactive materials 
(NORM) pursuant to applicable state and federal 
regulations. The Company recently implemented processes 
to reduce generation of NORM waste from ﬂ  owback ﬂ  uids 
by improving the efﬁ  ciency of its use of recycled ﬂ  uids 
and by reducing the holding time of these ﬂ  uids. This has 
led to a signiﬁ  cant reduction of generated NORM wastes 
requiring disposal.
EQT’s Process for Managing Naturally 
Occurring Radioactive Materials
During 2013, EQT generated technologically enhanced 
naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM) primarily 
from two sources. These were in the form of proppant sand 
that returned to storage containers at the surface during 
ﬂ owback operations and in sludge that accumulated in 
(impaired) water storage units (i.e. pits and tanks). 
The Company’s process for managing these materials 
consists of the following components: Waste Minimization, 
Waste Characterization, Waste Collection/Containerization, 
and Waste Transportation and Disposal.
7864_Text_C4.indd   17 8/29/14   1:10 PMGo back to Table of Contents18Waste minimization (typically associated with sludge 
accumulations) is accomplished by limiting the holding 
time of impaired water to minimize solids settling and 
precipitation of constituents. EQT reclaims or cleans and 
relines pits on a routine schedule to minimize sludge 
accumulation. When practicable, mobile and modular tanks 
are used instead of pits, which further limits holding time 
and sludge accumulation.
Prior to offering waste potentially containing TENORM 
for disposal, EQT collects a representative sample of the 
material for waste characterization. The waste sample 
is sent to an independent laboratory and analyzed for 
parameters including radiological isotopes. The analytical 
data is reviewed and sent to the appropriate disposal 
facility for approval, prior to scheduling the shipment of 
TENORM waste off-site.
TENORM waste accumulated in pits and tanks is collected 
using vacuum trucks. EQT’s contractor enters the storage 
units with a collection hose from the vacuum truck. The 
accumulated waste is pushed to the vacuum hose using 
pressure washers. The waste is placed directly into sealed roll-
off containers suitable for transport. If necessary, additional 
solidiﬁ  cation using various bulking agents is conducted. 
Once approved by the disposal facility, the containerized 
waste is placed on trucks for transportation to the chosen 
disposal facility. EQT has used two disposal options for 
TENORM waste. The primary option consists of getting the 
TENORM waste approved into local landﬁ  lls using existing 
state approval processes. If TENORM levels are above the 
local landﬁ  ll acceptance limits, then the waste is shipped to 
an alternative out-of-state facility that treats the TENORM 
levels to acceptable limits prior to landﬁ  ll placement.
Preventing and Managing Spills
Spill prevention is another top priority at EQT. Every 
worksite has its own Spill Prevention, Control and 
Countermeasure (SPCC) plan to minimize the chance for a 
release, and dictate actions to be taken should a spill occur.   
The plans also guide the implementation of rigorous 
training programs, inspection protocols, and secondary 
containment monitoring and repair programs for all of 
the Company’s natural gas wells and compressor stations. 
The Company conducts monthly inspections of its facilities 
and tracks the data electronically to enable rapid repairs.  
If a spill does occur, EQT uses appropriate and effective 
cleanup measures to quickly achieve complete remediation 
of the spill, including any affected soil. The Company 
typically uses vacuums, absorbent booms and pads, along 
with tools and equipment for soil excavation, to contain 
and ultimately remove the contents of the spill because 
these methods are effective and release no dispersants to 
the environment. Coupled with the controlled removal and 
disposal of the cleanup materials according to prevailing 
federal, state and local regulatory requirements in effect 
at the time of the spill, these cleanup measures have a 
minimal effect on nearby communities.  
At EQT, a signiﬁ  cant spill is one requiring notiﬁ  cation to 
state or federal ofﬁ  cials. In 2013, EQT experienced 34 
reportable spills, with a total volume of 474.72 barrels (bbls) 
or 19,938 U.S. gallons. These spills were not a required 
disclosure in the Company’s 2013 Form 10-K or any 
other required ﬁ  nancial statements. EQT experienced two 
reportable spills of more than 100 bbls (4,200 gallons) into 
the environment: a 168 bbls (7,056 U.S. gallons) ﬂ  owback 
release and a 117 bbls (4,914 U.S. gallons) brine release. 
EQT’s standard procedure is to follow every incident with 
an evaluation of the cause of the spill so it can identify and 
implement corrective action. To prevent recurrences, the 
Company shares these new techniques and protocols with 
its ﬁ eld employees and contractors, and integrates them 
into its design standards and operations.
7864_Text_C4.indd   18 8/29/14   1:10 PMGo back to Table of ContentsGreenhouse Gas Reduction
The Company’s greenhouse gas (GHG) management 
program formally began in 2008. The goal was to help EQT 
improve air quality in its communities by reducing its own 
greenhouse gas emissions associated with ﬁ  eld operations.  
Efforts continue to reduce the Company’s total estimated 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reportable GHG 
emissions, and each of the Company’s two business 
segments has identiﬁ  ed key areas that provide the most 
opportunities for GHG reductions. 
During 2013, EQT’s business segments reported the 
following greenhouse gas emissions:
Production:  583,037 metric tons CO2e  
Midstream:  466,235 metric tons CO2e
Distribution:  70,105 metric tons CO2e 
  (direct emissions up to the divestiture)
EQT Total:  1,119,377 metric tons CO2e

7864_Text_C4.indd   19 8/29/14   1:10 PMGo back to Table of ContentsGreen Completions
For a few days before a new well begins to produce gas, it 
also produces associated water, sand, chemicals and drilling 
debris. This time period is referred to as “completions” 
and the material is referred to as “ﬂ  owback.” In the past, 
producers collected the ﬂ  uid and solids in a pit and ﬂ  ared 
or vented the initial ﬂ  ow of gas into the atmosphere 
to allow the impurities in the ﬂ  owback to clear before 
connecting the well to the pipeline system.  
Alternatively, green completions techniques now 
enable EQT to capture the initial gas emitted during the 
well-completion process instead of releasing it to the 
atmosphere. Doing so successfully limits the amount of 
ﬂ ared and vented gas released to the atmosphere at the 
Company’s well sites. In 2013, 96% of completed EQT 
wells utilized “green completions,” as deﬁ  ned by the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
The few instances precluding reaching 100% typically 
resulted from discrete site or operational characteristics.  
With a green completion, the pipeline network is extended 
to the well site before well completion begins so it is 
ready to immediately receive any gas produced. During 
this process, the ﬂ  owback mixture is captured and routed 
through a separator to collect the solid materials, which 
are sent to an approved landﬁ  ll. The water, containing the chemicals and mineral constituents, is separated and stored 
for reuse in subsequent fracturing operations. 
The natural gas that traditionally used to be ﬂ  ared or 
vented is directed into the pipeline and sent off to market, 
drastically reducing methane emissions.  
During 2013, the volume of ﬂ  ared gas during well 
completions was 55,520 mcf, while the amount of 
vented gas during well completions was 14,503 mcf. 
In relation to the volume of natural gas produced in the 
year, the total volume of ﬂ  ared and vented gas was only 
0.000033 million barrel oil equivalent.
EQT provides emissions, including methane, as part of 
Subpart W reporting to the EPA for each of the 13,000 wells 
it operates. For Subpart W reporting, EQT uses EPA’s 
emission factors to estimate both CO2 and CH4 emissions 
from all wells. The factors can be found at Table W-1A of 
Subpart W - Default Whole Gas Emission Factors for Onshore 
Production, 40 CFR 98, Subpart W, except for pneumatics, 
which are set at NSPS OOOO limits. EQT’s 2013 upstream 
methane emissions were 0.19% of the Company’s total 
2013 production, as reported in EQT’s EPA 2013 Subpart W.
Using Natural Gas as an Alternate Fuel
In mid-2012, EQT began exploring the use of natural 
gas-powered drill rigs and completion equipment at its 
well sites. The design of these new drill rigs makes them 
cleaner and quieter to operate than conventional diesel-
powered equipment. Although they cost more to build, the 
natural gas rigs can be less expensive to operate. The major 
beneﬁ  t is to the environment, as the rigs running on natural 
gas emit 20% to 30% less carbon dioxide compared to 
their diesel counterparts, and have a small fraction of the 
emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulates.   
EQT ﬁ  eld tested two different options for displacing diesel 
fuel in production activities. One used a drilling rig powered 
by liqueﬁ  ed natural gas (LNG); the other was a rig converted 
to use “ﬁ  eld gas,” which is unprocessed gas that comes 
directly from a nearby well. This latter method taps into 
gathering pipelines that carry gas from onsite production.  
In addition to reducing emissions, powering rigs with 
ﬁ eld gas eliminates the noise and truck trafﬁ  c associated 
with deliveries of diesel fuel used to power traditional rig 
equipment. The success of EQT’s initial pilot operations 
led to more rig conversions in 2013; by the end of the 
year, the Company was regularly using four rigs powered 
by ﬁ eld gas, and expects to have at least two more in 
service by the end of 2014.

7864_Text_C4.indd   20 8/29/14   1:10 PMGo back to Table of ContentsGo back to Table of ContentsUse of Land Resources 
EQT maintains a strong commitment to minimizing impacts 
on protected species, minimizing surface disruptions, and 
reclaiming the land to its original state after the Company’s 
active operations are complete. EQT holds leases that 
include protected areas such as wetlands, national and 
state forests, and Army Corps of Engineers property; 
however in 2013 EQT did not drill wells in any of these 
sensitive areas.   
EQT actively tries to avoid drilling inside protected areas; 
however it sometimes has operations that are located 
nearby. As a leader in the use of horizontal drilling 
technology, the Company is able to drill multiple wells 
from the same pad, minimizing the impact on the land 
and surrounding environmental resources. EQT can also 
drill directionally to extract gas from nearby sensitive areas, 
following all federal, state and local regulations and guidelines.   
Where any protected species may be present, EQT conducts 
environmental studies on and near the proposed site to 
conﬁ rm the presence of that species before any ﬁ  eld activity 
begins. If the species is found and cannot be avoided, EQT 
works with the appropriate agencies to create protection 
plans. In some cases, local resources are recruited to help 
identify threatened, endangered, or special-concerns 
species. If potential impacts emerge, EQT coordinates with 
those local agencies to develop and implement avoidance 
and/or mitigation measures.

21Another area where EQT continues to actively promote 
the use of natural gas is as a cleaner-burning alternative to 
carbon-rich fuels such as gasoline and diesel for vehicles. 
In response to demand from ﬂ  eet owners and individual 
users, the Company added additional pump capacity at 
its public-access compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling 
station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and actively supported 
initiatives to expand the infrastructure needed to promote 
greater use of CNG as a transportation fuel in all states 
where EQT has business operations.   
As new CNG fueling stations spread across Pennsylvania 
and West Virginia in 2013, the Company continued the 
conversion of its ﬂ  eet to run on compressed natural gas 
(CNG). This has helped reduce EQT’s vehicle-related carbon 
emissions by 20% - 30% compared to the older gasoline 
and diesel fueled vehicles.
Using Energy Wisely 
Natural gas is EQT’s primary direct energy source for 
conditioning building spaces for occupancy (with a small need 
for heating oil in locations where gas is not readily available). 
The Company also uses a signiﬁ  cant amount of electricity for 
heating/cooling, lighting, and various support equipment.   
EQT maintains an extensive preventative maintenance 
program for all of its facilities, and uses benchmarking 
against similar buildings in an effort to identify 
opportunities for improvement and ensure that all facilities 
run efﬁ  ciently. As maintenance or renovations take 
place, the Company upgrades lighting ﬁ  xtures; installs 
motion sensors; uses night and weekend setbacks to 
control temperature during low occupancy; and upgrades 
equipment to take advantage of energy efﬁ  ciencies.
EQT also encourages its employees to contribute to 
the reduction of GHG emissions. For those based in 
traditional ofﬁ  ce environments, ﬂ  exible work schedules and commuting options such as public transportation are 
encouraged, as is the use of web-based meeting services 
and conference calls, to reduce the need for vehicle travel.  
EQT also launched a cash incentive program to help interested 
employees purchase CNG vehicles for personal use.

The EQT core beneﬁ  t package is designed to meet 
the personal and professional needs and expectations 
of employees and their families. Where appropriate, 
specialized training relevant to an individual’s position and 
area of responsibility may be offered, plus the Company 
provides general training in areas such as corporate ethics 
and compliance, and safety.   
Supplementing the beneﬁ  t package is EQT’s “Take Charge” 
wellness program, that offers personal health coaching, 
wellness information, and health management programs to 
help employees and their families address personal health 
and wellness issues. These resources are administered 
outside of EQT, and individual results or information from 
any part of the Program remain strictly conﬁ  dential and are 
not provided to EQT. The Take Charge program includes 
quarterly employee educational sessions that are facilitated 
by professional medical staff and scheduled during work 
hours, as well as newsletters mailed to employees’ homes 
for the beneﬁ  t of their families.
EQT’s Employee Assistance Program compliments Take 
Charge by providing conﬁ  dential short-term counseling 
25Social Responsibility
services and treatment programs; as well as referrals for 
issues such as family and relationship concerns, elder care, 
money management and legal problems. All employees, 
including those who waive the Company’s medical 
coverage, are enrolled in this beneﬁ  t — and anyone living 
in the employee’s household is also eligible. The Company 
pays the full cost for up to ﬁ  ve in-person visits with a 
counselor for each problem.
In 2013, EQT instituted an on-site health screening program 
for all employees. This program assesses body mass index, 
blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol levels. Immediate 
results are provided to the employee and reviewed with 
the employee by medical professionals. The Company also 
provides a $150 incentive to employees that participate 
in online or telephone-based health coaching programs 
offered through the University of Pittsburgh Medical 
Center’s MyHealth Wellness program.
EQT has detailed standards for assessing potential hazards 
in the work environment and selecting the appropriate 
forms of equipment to protect employees, contractors, 
service providers and visitors. The Company also maintains 
a robust workplace safety training program that includes 
both regulatory and risk-based training for its employees.

EQT actively strives to engage its stakeholders who have 
an active interest in the Company’s operations and how 
these activities affect their lives. Because each group 
has speciﬁ  c needs, interests, and preferences, EQT has 
developed a number of communications tools to address 
key concerns and ensure that stakeholders have the 
information they need regarding the business and its role 
in their communities.   
EQT identiﬁ  es its stakeholder groups based on their 
recurring contact with, or interest in, the operations of the 
Company. As with any collection of diverse entities, one 
size does not ﬁ  t all so the approaches used to engage, 
hear, understand, and inform these interested parties are 
numerous. EQT’s primary stakeholder groups include:
 Investors
 Employees
 Communities
 Landowners/Royalty Owners
 Elected Ofﬁ  cials
 Regulators
 Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)
 Nonproﬁ  t Organizations and Charities
 Suppliers
 News Media/Industry Analysts
 Industry Associations
What follows on the next page is a broad sampling of 
the types and frequency of interactions EQT has with its 
stakeholders, along with some speciﬁ  c approaches to 
maintaining contact with the broad EQT community.
26Addressing Community Concerns
EQT belongs to a number of civic and trade associations at 
the local, state, and national level (see the Public Policy and 
Political Engagement section of this report). The Company’s 
strategic involvement in these organizations enables it 
to share transparent and accurate information about the 
natural gas industry, including the beneﬁ  ts of natural gas 
and related services. The participation of EQT employees in 
these organizations, often in leadership roles, also enables 
the Company to add its knowledge and experience to the 
development of best practices for operational activities and 
stakeholder engagement that can be used across the industry.
Community open houses and sponsorship of local fairs 
and festivals continue to be a popular outreach method.  
These forums allow stakeholders to informally meet EQT 
employees, ask questions or offer comments on topics 
that they believe are most important — in return, EQT 
stakeholders receive immediate feedback. Some of the 
issues and resulting response mechanisms are summarized  
in the chart on the following page.
With changes in laws, ordinances, and regulatory 
requirements, EQT’s stakeholder communications and 
community relations efforts must continually improve — 
and in an effort to develop viable, two-way partnerships 
with the Company’s operating communities, the position of 
Community Advisor was created in 2012 to provide a more 
personal point of contact. The Community Advisors, who 
are employees of EQT, are situated regionally (southwest 
Pennsylvania, north central Pennsylvania, and West Virginia/
Kentucky) and have worked to cultivate relationships 
with local ofﬁ  cials and ﬁ  rst responder personnel, as well 
as with existing and potential landowners. Because they 
are in EQT’s operating communities on a daily basis, the 
Community Advisors are a great source of information that 
the Company uses to identify concerns before they become 
problems, as well as suggest ways that EQT can strengthen 
its processes and procedures. They also serve as community 
advocates, ensuring that issues reach the right person in 
the Company and ultimately achieve resolution.
In 2013, as result of the Community Advisor roles, EQT 
initiated an “issues tracking and resolution” process to 
document community and landowner questions/concerns 
in order to develop an ongoing dialogue and problem-
resolution methodology. The ultimate goal of the process 
is to identify common issues so the Company can better 
anticipate and resolve them before they arise at similar 
operations. The internally managed database captures the

steps taken to address an issue; the ongoing status of the 
issue, including when and how it was resolved; and lessons 
learned to help avoid a recurrence. The database also 
facilitates the reporting of community concerns upward 
within the Company. Of the 113 issues reported to the 
issues tracking database in 2013, 54% were related to 
construction trafﬁ  c or road conditions; 20% were about 
possible property damage; and the remaining 27% were 
individual inquiries about leasing, tour requests, donations, 
veriﬁ cations of permits, noise, easements, rights of way, 
and the status of future activities.
Internally, EQT’s operating segments organize their 
responses to community issues in accordance with the 
source and nature of concern; therefore, many, but not all, 
may be included in the issues tracking system maintained 
by the Community Advisors. The Production segment’s 
land administration department handles royalty complaints 
and certain change of lease ownership questions, while its 
land department handles leasing questions and landowner 
complaints about drilling and associated activities. The 
Midstream segment’s land department handles questions 
and landowner complaints about pipeline construction, 
pipeline safety, and compressor station operations. Each 
group has a different tracking process tailored to the nature 
of the inquiry or complaint and various new systems are 
under review and development.
In the Environment, Health and Safety department, EQT 
also has implemented a fresh water source protection, 
monitoring, and internal reporting program. This 
program is designed to assess and understand pre-
existing groundwater conditions, monitor conditions 
during drilling and fracturing operations, and quickly 
respond to any discovered water issues or landowner 
complaints. The report includes analytical data, complaints, 
complaint status, and updates on whether the complaint EQT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT –

report is provided on a periodic basis to senior Production 
leadership and to EQT’s Executive Environmental Council.
Community Investment
In the oil and gas industry, having a “social license to 
operate” is imperative and EQT works hard to integrate the 
concept of social responsibility into the many facets of its 
business. With all employees located in the United States, 
the Company strives to hire from within its operating 
regions when the required skill sets are available. This effort 
also is extended to the supply chain, going so far as to help 
local companies partner with larger vendors to gain valuable 
industry experience. EQT and the EQT Foundation also 
provide substantial support to local non-proﬁ  t and charitable 
organizations that work to improve the quality of life for those 
living within and around the Company’s operating regions.   
In 2013, EQT and the EQT Foundation invested more than 
$5.3 million in charitable giving to local communities. The 
EQT Foundation, a separate 501(c)(3) organization, awarded 
nearly $4 million of that amount to support programing in 
Education, Arts and Culture, Environment, and Community 
— areas of mutual importance to EQT and its various 
stakeholders in the communities near its operations in 
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, and Virginia.   
In Pennsylvania, the Company continues to award funds to 
support public school education via the state’s Educational 
Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) program. The popularity of EQT COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS – 2013

this program, along with state budgeting constraints, can 
affect how much EQT is allowed to contribute each year.  
Across its ﬁ  ve-state footprint, EQT also contributed funds to 
local ﬁ  re departments, food banks, and other community-
based charities; and sponsored fairs, festivals, and various 
community events in counties where the Company has a 
regional headquarters or signiﬁ  cant ﬁ  eld operations. EQT 
supplies in-kind support via company endorsed employee 
volunteerism, including service on committees or governance 
boards of local non-proﬁ  t organizations and associations.
During 2013, EQT also invested almost $19 million to 
improve local roads and infrastructure in 23 counties 
where the Company had active operations.

Political Engagement
As a publicly traded organization, EQT governs its activities 
by, and fully complies with, all U.S. laws and regulations 
that oversee public policy and political engagement for 
energy companies. EQT supports federal, state, and local 
policies that promote stable investment climates for the 
exploration, production, and transportation of natural gas. 
These include policies governing environmental protection, 
taxes, natural gas production, and transportation, as 
well as policies expanding the use of natural gas in the 
transportation, manufacturing and electricity generation 
sectors. A summary of EQT’s political activity policy is 
provided in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct 
and Ethics  available on the EQT website at ir.eqt.com/
charters-and-documents .  Corporate Engagement
EQT’s political engagement takes on many forms. Upon 
approval by Company management, EQT corporate 
treasury dollars may be used to pay business and industry 
trade association membership dues. These organizations 
support member companies by educating the public, 
advocating the interests of its member companies and 
industry, fostering critical relationships, and supporting 
informed public policy decisions. Business and industry 
trade associations may allocate a portion of their 
membership dues to lobbying activities. A complete list of 
memberships, including dues paid and dollars applied to 
lobbying activities, is shown in the chart on the next page.  
In 2013, political spending using EQT corporate treasury 
dollars totaled $43,800. The Company supported the 
Democratic Governors Association and the Republican 
Governors Association, both of which are organized under 
Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, but EQT did 
not make any contributions or payments of corporate 
dollars to Super PACs, ballot measure committees, or 
social welfare organizations for political purposes. EQT also 
used corporate treasury dollars to support candidates for, 
and members of, the Virginia General Assembly, subject 
to the campaign ﬁ  nance laws of that state and disclosed 
by the Virginia Public Access Project (vpap.org) . Refer to 
Performance Indicator SO6 in the GRI Content Index of this

support to business and industry trade associations to further 
enhance their advocacy, educational outreach, scientiﬁ  c 
research and public awareness efforts. EQT employees are 
active participants in the governance of the organizations 
to which the Company belongs, often serving as chair of 
key committees or subcommittees. Depending upon the 
structure of the association, these chair positions may be 
considered part of the governance body.
As active participants on association committees and related 
programs or projects, EQT employees speak at industry 
conferences and conventions, address the public and/
media, and represent the industry in testimony before 
government or other regulatory bodies. 
EQT views all of these memberships as strategic components 
of its efforts to engage stakeholders, develop and implement 
best practices, and encourage ﬁ  nancial, social and 
environmental sustainability by members of the industry.
Employee Engagement
As individuals, EQT employees participate in the political 
process on a strictly voluntary basis. Some employees 
participate by making voluntary contributions to the EQT 
Employees’ Pennsylvania State Political Action Committee 
(PAC) and the EQT Employees’ Federal PAC. These PACs 
make contributions to candidates, political parties, and 
political committees. The EQT Employees’ Pennsylvania 
State PAC is primarily funded through transfers from 
the EQT Employees’ Federal PAC.or
All of these contributions were made in compliance 
with the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction of 
the Company’s business operations, including all U.S. 
federal and state campaign ﬁ  nance laws. EQT discloses 
contributions from the PACs to the United States Federal 
Elections Commission (fec.gov) .
In 2013, total political spending from the two EQT 
employee PACs totalled $109,959. There were no ﬁ  nancial 
or in-kind contributions to political parties, politicians, 
or related institutions outside the United States. Refer to 
Performance Indicator SO6 in the GRI Content Index of 
this report for details of all political spending in 2013.

Beyond its corporate philanthropy and other community 
investments, EQT supports the severance taxes and impact 
fees imposed by state legislatures to compensate local 
communities that are affected by active drilling operations.   
In addition to working with landowners to remediate 
and restore the land to its original condition after drilling 
is complete, EQT invests millions of dollars each year to 
improve local roads and infrastructure affected by its 
activities. In 2013, the Company invested almost $19 
million on roads in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.
As of December 31, 2013, EQT employed 1,626 
employees, excluding the 342 employees of Equitable Gas 
Company, which was sold to a third-party in December 
2013. EQT’s year-end 2013 annual payroll, before beneﬁ  ts, 
exceeded $283 million. The Company paid approximately 
$12 million in state and local wage-related taxes in 2013, 
with much of that being returned to its operating areas.  
EQT’s operational activity supported approximately 6,200 
full and part-time jobs, and added approximately $0.9 
billion in total value to the economy. The Company’s 
capital expenditures supported more than 15,200 direct 
and indirect jobs and contributed just over $1.4 million in 
economic value across the ﬁ  ve states where EQT operated.EQT’s positive indirect impact on local economies during 
2013 takes many forms:
 Every direct EQT job supports an additional 2.2 jobs in 
the broader economy
 The wages of EQT employees and service providers have 
a ripple effect on the broader economy because these 
wages are used to buy goods and services
 Royalty payments made by EQT also have a ripple 
effect on the economy as they provide resources to fuel 
additional consumer spending 
 Through its supply chain, EQT created jobs in various, 
related industries that may not exist without EQT’s 
business activities
 Local businesses that provide products and services to 
EQT make their own supply chain purchase and hire 
employees who in turn spend their salaries and wages 
throughout the local and state economies
To further demonstrate the contributions that EQT has 
made to its communities, the Pennsylvania Economy 
League of Greater Pittsburgh conducted several analyses 
to estimate the economic impact of the Company’s 
operations, its capital expenditures, and its royalty 
payments. There is overlap between the analyzed data; 
therefore, the ﬁ  gures should not be added together, 
as this may signiﬁ  cantly overstate EQT’s effect on local 
economies.  The following four tables are a compilation of 
results from EQT’s 2013 economic impact analysis provided 
by the Pennsylvania Economy League of Greater Pittsburgh, 
and based on data as of December 31, 2013.

via the Supply Chain
EQT strives to award procurement contracts locally 
whenever possible because it understands the socio-
economic value of buying local to enhance indigenous 
economies. The Company deﬁ  nes local as the ﬁ  ve states 
where EQT conducted its operational activities in 2013.
EQT actively seeks help from national and regional 
trade associations, chambers of commerce and supplier 
advisory councils throughout the United States to identify 
local bidders; and after careful consideration through 
its selection process, the Company aims to choose local 
suppliers if all other factors are equal. Criteria that may 
inﬂ uence EQT supplier selection include:
 Safety  – Safe and environmentally responsible 
operations are imperatives at EQT. To enforce these 
essentials, suppliers must be pre-approved as applicable 
to the good or service.  
 Value  – EQT places signiﬁ  cance on the overall value that 
suppliers offer. Suppliers who differentiate their offerings 
from their competitors through increased value merit 
greater consideration.                                                                                                                                  
 Price  – In most cases, lower costs create a competitive 
advantage for suppliers because EQT receives 
cost-savings that impacts its bottom line, increases 
shareholder value for investors, and positions the 
Company to potentially pass these cost savings on 
to its customers.                                                                                                                                      
 Quality  – As EQT strives to increase overall quality 
to better serve the communities where it operates, 
the Company expects best-in-class supply chain 
performance from suppliers.                                                                                                                                      
 Delivery  – On-time delivery is a critical measurement 
of consideration and is necessary to avoid expensive 
operational delays.
To foster development of diverse and/or local suppliers, 
EQT participates in “opportunity” fairs and events targeting 
small businesses. These events identify qualiﬁ  ed bidders 
able to work directly with EQT, as well as to promote 
subcontracting opportunities with EQT’s prime suppliers.   
To further encourage these ﬁ  rst tier suppliers to consider 
local vendors, EQT has enhanced its standard procurement 
process to include: Bidding process and Request for Proposal (RFP) 
Language  – To encourage local supplier utilization, 
during the solicitation process EQT’s standard RFP 
strongly encourages prime suppliers to seek out and 
include diverse businesses as part of their proposed 
solution. All bidders must complete and attach a 
subcontracting form with their proposal. The inclusion 
of diverse companies, most of which are local, will be 
evaluated as part of the review process. 
 Tier 2 Program  – In its efforts to promote local spend 
and diverse supplier utilization, EQT’s Procurement 
Department requires top suppliers to provide their 
monthly spend with local and/or diverse subcontractors. 
In support of second tier efforts to identify and utilize 
products and services from local or diverse suppliers, 
EQT coordinates meetings with its suppliers, buyers, 
and various local ﬁ  rms. As an example, the annual 
Supplier Diversity Matchmaking Event, conducted 
by EQT in partnership with other leading energy 
companies, creates an opportunity for qualiﬁ  ed small, 
minority-owned, women-owned, and veteran-owned 
businesses to meet the top suppliers for each company 
and develop relationships that can lead to capacity-
building projects for the local and diverse businesses.  
 Procurement Value Drivers – To encourage diverse 
supplier utilization and to ensure accountability, EQT 
actively tracks and reports the following for diverse 
suppliers: number of suppliers; aggregate spend; and 
percentage of total spend. The majority of diverse 
suppliers are local to EQT’s operations.
In 2013, EQT spent 46% of its procurement budget 
with local vendors compared to 49% in 2012. To assist 
local companies who are unable to meet existing needs 
or requirements, EQT provides educational seminars to 
various small business organizations to help their members 
build capacity. The Company also works closely with local 
and diverse companies that have performed successfully 
to ﬁ nd opportunities to expand the amount of work 
they do for EQT. As these local ﬁ  rms build capacity and 
are considered for larger projects, they can increase their 
workforce and increase their purchases, adding to the 
positive ripple effect on the local economy.

 EQT Corporation operates primarily within the United States of America, but does have foreign subsidiaries, which are either 
inactive or in the process of winding down. The Company’s active business operations are subject to various U. S. federal, stat e 
and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to various sustainability issues. The Company’s vari ous 
events and circumstances can present risks and opportunities to the business. See EQT’s 2013 Form 10-K pages 14-22, for more 
discussion about these events and circumstances. This document is available on EQT’s website at ir.eqt.com  under SEC Filings, or

 EQT does not establish speciﬁ  c targets for sustainability performance — instead the Company evaluates these issues as part of 
its overall performance management. The Company also does not have governance mechanisms in place to speciﬁ  cally manage 
sustainability risk and opportunities; however, many aspects of sustainability risks and opportunities are the responsibility o f the

 The report covers all EQT Corporation headquarters activities, and the Company’s two business segments: Production and 
Midstream. The domain of this report does not include operational activity at Equitable Gas Company (sold by EQT in 2013); 
however EQT’s ownership interest in this entity is reﬂ  ected in all reported 2013 ﬁ  nancial data for the Company, including economic 
impact analyses. Also excluded from this report are the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, which are either inactive or in the pro cess 
of winding down.
 For indicators where reporting data is not completely available, this is described within the individual disclosure.
3.7 State any speciﬁ  c limitations on the scope or boundary of the report (see completeness principle for explanation of scope)

ﬁ nancial results, as well as the operational activities of EQT’s Midstream business segment.
 On December 17, 2013, EQT Corporation completed the transfer of its natural gas Distribution segment, including Equitable Gas 
Company, LLC, to Peoples Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Steel River Infrastructure Partners. With the transfer, all performance 
data for Equitable Gas became the property of Peoples Natural Gas, so this report does not include the operating activities of this

  Communications are directed to the Lead Independent Director. Shareholders can contact the Lead Independent Director via email 
at presidingdirector@eqt.com.
  Employees may use the ethics hotline, anonymously, if desired. EQT does not have a formal representation body for employees to 
provide recommendations to the highest governing body, so no sustainability topics were raised through such a mechanism.
4.5  Linkage between compensation for members of the highest governance body, senior managers, and executives (including 
departure arrangements), and the organization’s performance (including social and environmental performance)
 Fully Reported
 Description of general linkages is found in the annual Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Specific 
details, including linkages between compensation and EQT’s financial, social and environmental performance are defined by 
individual employment agreements for senior managers and executives, which are confidential.
 Since January 2012, all employees have at least one personal value driver linking them to the company’s Corporate Social 
Responsibility objectives as they relate to each individual’s position in the company. This value driver has a direct impact on 
personal compensation at all levels of the organization.

EN4 Indirect energy consumption by primary source
 Fully Reported
 See the “Environmental Stewardship – Using Energy Wisely” section of this report.  
 EQT facilities utilized 31,467.2 gigajoules of indirect energy in 2013, mostly electricity. Actual usage was determined from u tility 
invoices for each facility. The primary fuels used to produce electricity in EQT’s operating areas are coal, natural gas and nu clear.  
When calculating electricity usage, EQT used a conversion factor of 1kwh = 3,600,000 joules.
 EQT leases all equipment used for its production, midstream and distribution ﬁ  eld activities, so the Company does not have any 
indirect sources of energy for these activities.

Fully Reported
 EQT has not pre-determined (as a matter of policy) the minimum number of weeks of notice that will be given in the event of 
signiﬁ  cant operational changes. The length of the notice period is determined on a case-by-case basis considering several 
factors which include, but are not limited to, number of employees affected, type or impact of operational change, timeframe fo r 
implementing change, etc.
 As of December 31, 2013, EQT had no employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Occupational Health and Safety 
LA6 Percentage of total workforce represented in formal joint management-worker health and safety committees that help monitor 
and advise on occupational health and safety programs
 Fully Reported
 Approximately 20% of the total workforce was represented in joint health and safety committees during 2013. These joint 
committees typically operate at the District or Area Supervisor level down to hourly workers. The number is signiﬁ  cantly less than 
previous years due to the transfer of Distribution segment (Equitable Gas Company) employees to Peoples Natural Gas.
LA7 Rates of injury, occupational diseases, lost days, and absenteeism, and number of work related fatalities by region and gen der
Fully Reported
 See “Social Responsibility – The EQT Workforce” and “Workplace Safety” sections of this report.
 EQT does not utilize supervised workers as deﬁ  ned by GRI, nor does the company utilize independent contractors for onsite 
work, so it does not maintain safety data for these categories of workers. All reported data applies to EQT’s total workforce 
of 1,626 employees as reported in Performance Indicator LA1 and includes minor (ﬁ  rst-aid level) injuries. EQT uses OSHA 
accepted calculation rates that utilize total work hours. The normalization factor is 200,000; this represents 100 full-time 
workers for one year.
 EQT records the nature of each incident for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  OSHA does not 
require, nor does EQT track, region or gender details. EQT’s IR for 2013 = OSHA Recordable Rate = 2.04. OSHA does not require, 
nor does EQT track, occupational disease rates for its workforce.
 When calculating lost days, days means ‘calendar days’ and the lost day count begins when a medical professional classiﬁ  es it as 
a lost time accident. EQT’s lost day rate (LDR) for the total workforce was 0.39, and included four males in KY, one male in VA , and 
one male in PA.
 There were no EQT employee fatalities in 2013.
 EQT employees are required to report all safety incidents. Reporting and recording are conducted in compliance with 
OSHA requirements.

grade levels.  
 The Company also provides Leadership Development Training, facilitated by EQT Human Resources employees who are certiﬁ  ed trainers, for all 
employees with direct reports. The training includes ﬁ  ve modules, totaling 19 hours. In addition, individual department budgets include funding 
for external executive education and/or seminars.  
 Finally, with the approval of the employee’s business unit or functional leader and the Vice President and Chief Human Resourc es Ofﬁ  cer, 
an unpaid personal leave of absence may be granted for personal reasons (which include a sabbatical). The duration of job-prote cted leave 
depends on the employee’s length of Company service.
 EQT works with employees nearing retirement to ensure a smooth transition at the end of employment. Sessions were also conduct ed in 
person by Fidelity Investments in 2013 to cover employment transition issues. Fidelity also offers on-line courses, one-on-one meetings in their 
local ofﬁ  ces and telephone based advice for those employees seeking advice and personalized services. Additionally, the Employee Assist ance 
Program offers on-line courses and individual counseling sessions for those employees retiring or terminating from the company.
 EQT also provides educational sessions for active employees on Medicare and Social Security beneﬁ  ts, as well as how to best utilize the 
resources available through the Beneﬁ  ts Service Center. In the event of involuntary termination without cause, the Company’s Severance 
Pay Plan provides pay and beneﬁ  ts (medical, dental and vision) continuation. The duration of pay and beneﬁ  ts continuation is based on the 
employee’s length of Company service.  
LA12 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews, by gender
 Fully Reported
 As of December 31, 2013, 97% of all EQT employees received a formal performance appraisal and review for 2013.

SOCIAL: HUMAN RIGHTS
 Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining
HR5 Operations and signiﬁ  cant suppliers identiﬁ  ed in which the right to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining 
may be violated or at signiﬁ  cant risk, and actions taken to support these rights
 Fully Reported
 All of EQT’s operations are in the United States. As such, EQT and the suppliers who provide it with signiﬁ  cant goods or services are 
subject to applicable federal and state laws governing employment, the right to associate (or not associate) with a labor union  and 
collective bargaining (i.e., National Labor Relations Act, etc.).  
 Because of long-standing U.S. labor laws and the mechanisms available for enforcing those laws, the rights of employees to exe rcise 
freedom of association or collective bargaining are not at signiﬁ  cant risk in any of EQT’s operations.
 All suppliers are also required to submit documentation including a current certiﬁ  cate of liability insurance and Department of 
Treasury Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form W-9 certifying the company’s location of operations and status as a U.S. person as  
deﬁ ned by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 EQT complies (and requires its suppliers to comply) with applicable laws and regulations. When appropriate, during the applica ble 
reporting period, EQT provided training to managers/supervisors concerning applicable labor laws and EQT’s responsibility 
under them.

OG11 Number of sites that have been decommissioned and sites that are in the process of being decommissioned
 Fully Reported
 EQT Corporation is only involved with onshore activities. There are no offshore decommissioning activities to report.  
 Active Sites
Midstream: 128 active compressor stations and 9 active dehydration stations 
Production: Approx. 14,200 active wells and 2,221 shut-in wells
 Inactive Sites
Midstream: 38 inactive compressor stations and 3 stations decommissioned in 2013
Production: 69 wells plugged and abandoned in 2013
 For purposes of this report, EQT deﬁ  nes inactive sites as non-operating compressor stations (midstream operations) and shut-in 
wells (production operations) that are closed off and do not produce natural gas.
 EQT does not explicitly track the total land area of active and inactive sites, but the Company will explore its ability to me asure and 
report this data for future reports.
 EQT bases decommissioning decisions on the economic viability of the site (e.g., natural gas wells that are no longer producin g gas 
are shut-in); no EQT sites that were active in 2013 had decommissioning plans in place. Perry station in KY is scheduled to be shut 
down in 2014.  
 There were no complaints on outstanding local community issues nor any government notices on decommissioning.
