ABOUT THIS REPORT
The 2018 Corporate Responsibility 
Report is our second report aligned with 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
Standards framework, which we apply at 
the Comprehensive level. This year, we 
also began initial efforts to report to the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB) and the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosure 
(TCFD) standards.That mission extends well beyond connecting customers on our 
network of hundreds of global destinations. It's about creating 
opportunities for cultural understanding, economic growth and 
stronger communities, driven by 80,000 people who put humanity 
and empathy into everything we do.
 
This report outlines our efforts in 2018 to move beyond the basics 
of our business and be a force for positive change worldwide.
 
HERE ARE A FEW HIGHLIGHTS:
REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
The No. 1 contributor to our carbon footprint is our use of jet  
fuel, and it is the chief focus of our efforts to reduce our emissions 
and manage our environmental impact. We continue to work 
toward our long-term goal of reducing net aviation emissions by 
50 percent by 2050, as we replace older aircraft with more fuel-
efficient jets, improve the efficiency of our existing aircraft and 
mitigate emissions with carbon offsets.
 
Delta's people are constantly seeking impactful and innovative 
energy projects across our operation. New cockpit technology is reducing the impact of turbulence, making flights more fuel 
efficient as well as more comfortable. A project to reduce the 
running time of our onboard auxiliary power units while planes 
are parked at the gate also is reducing our fuel burn. In Seattle, 
we're working with 12 other airlines on a plan to reduce emissions 
and explore the use of aviation biofuels, which are sustainably 
produced. And we are investing in electric ground support 
equipment and vehicles that further reduce our carbon footprint.
 
PROMOTING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
I believe strongly that Delta should reflect the diversity of the 
world we serve. Delta Vision 2020, a three-year plan to increase 
diversity, particularly in leadership roles, at our company, supports 
and measures our progress in promoting inclusion and driving 
accountability. More than 80 percent of our leaders have participated 
in diversity training and education, with a focus on unconscious 
bias and leading with inclusion. And Business Resource Groups, 
focusing on LGBTQ equality, veterans, working families and other 
diverse groups, provide professional development and employee 
engagement. They are also a great source for new and innovative 
business solutions.A MESSAGE 
FROM ED  
I have long believed 
that Delta's mission of 
connecting people around 
the globe is a noble one.  
Since our founding more 
than 90 years ago, we 
have built our business 
on the shared values of 
service to our people, 
our customers and the 
communities we serve.
 I am proud of our efforts and humbled by the 
work ahead as we strive to make this world 
a better place for generations to come."

A MESSAGE FROM ED
 
BUILDING BETTER COMMUNITIES
Giving back to the communities where we live, work and serve has 
been part of our culture for decades, and today it is formalized with 
our pledge to give 1 percent of net income back to communities across 
the globe. Last year that provided more than $50 million from Delta 
and The Delta Air Lines Foundation to charitable partners. 
 
Funding alone is never enough, no matter how generous. That's why 
we recently launched The Great Delta Give-Back, an annual paid 
day of service for all of Delta's people worldwide—an initiative that 
is providing 640,000 hours of service every year to communities 
around the globe.
 
PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST  
As CEO, my top responsibility is taking care of our people. That's 
why my favorite day of the year is Valentine's Day, when we give 
our employees the profit-sharing checks they have earned with 
their hard work and dedication. We celebrated a milestone in 
2018 when we set aside more than $1 billion in profit sharing for 
our people worldwide for the fifth year in a row. The scope of our 
program is unmatched in American business, but it is just one part of our commitment to putting people at the heart of everything we 
do. The empathy and humanity demonstrated on a daily basis by 
Delta people is at the heart of what sets us apart.
 
Our commitment to our people-focused culture has resulted  
in recognition as a great place to work by Fortune, Glassdoor, 
Indeed.com, Forbes, Business Insider and others. Innovative 
recruitment efforts are vital to maintaining that culture into the 
future, and we have been rolling out workforce development 
initiatives to help train the next generation of pilots, aircraft 
technicians, engineers and others who we hope will join the  
Delta family.
 
LEADING SAFEL Y
Our commitment to our customers and people starts with their 
safety, which is a core value at Delta and impacts every decision. 
That commitment includes safety on the ground, in the air and 
in the workplace. Our Safety Management System is a rigorous 
protocol that establishes our safety expectations, and defines the 
tools and methods we use to assess and improve safety every day. 
 
You can learn about all of these efforts, and much more, in this report. 
As I review the progress we have made, I am proud of our efforts while 
simultaneously humbled by the work ahead as we strive to make 
this world a better place for generations to come. Whether you are 
a customer, an investor, an employee or a community partner, I thank 
you for joining us on this journey and look forward to climbing together.

6When Delta employees boarded planes and entered warehouses and maintenance 
hangars on May 29th, they did so with a whole new look. The date marked the 
debut of our new uniform collection, the first update for Airport Customer 
Service and In-Flight Service employees since 2007 and for Cargo and 
Technical Operations (TechOps) employees since 2000. 
As Delta prepared for the new, Zac Posen-designed uniforms to 
make their appearance, we also had to decide what to do with 
the uniforms we’d be retiring. “The first question employees 
asked when they heard about new uniforms was what to do 
with the old ones,” says Scott Hamlin, CEO of Looptworks, 
a Delta upcycling partner. “They wanted to know that 
the uniforms would be put to meaningful use.” 
We’re aware of the challenges presented by textile 
waste, more than 15 million tons of which are sent to 
landfills every year. Before the new uniforms were 
released, Delta design teams conducted wear-testing 
to ensure designs would support a variety of job 
functions, climates and body types. After testing, 
these prototypes were donated to re:loom, an 
Atlanta organization, where weavers designed 
and produced handmade products 
such as rugs, keychains and more.
With a plan to upcycle the prototypes,  
we next had to figure out a plan for an entire 
airline’s worth of old uniforms—more than  
1 million pieces in all. Working with more than a 
half-dozen partners, we expanded our donation and 
upcycling program to put uniforms to work in a number of sustainable ways. 
By using every piece of material donated, these efforts allowed us to achieve 
one of the largest single company textile diversion programs in U.S. history.
Delta also marked the launch of our new uniforms with fashion shows 
and celebrations coast to coast—even in the air. We incorporated the 
uniforms into one of our in-flight safety videos, which featured Delta 
crewmembers wearing Delta uniforms from the 1940s to today. We’re proud 
to be writing a new chapter in Delta history—one that looks to the future 
while recognizing the positive impact we can make in the present.

Boxes were placed in more than  
90 cities around the Delta system.  
Partners Looptworks, Relay Resources  
and the Bobby Dodd Institute (BDI) sorted, 
deconstructed and warehoused all donations.

DONATION
Non-branded Delta items  
in good condition were donated to  
The Salvation Army. Covenant House  
Georgia gave gently used uniform  
pieces to homeless youth  
attending job interviews.UPCYCLING
Looptworks took branded Delta items  
and upcycled them, or turned them into new  
products. Many of the products also used  
leather from retired aircraft seats, which itself  
is a waste product from other leather manufacturing.  
A portion of the proceeds were donated to the Youth 
Environmental Education and Action Fund  
through the Captain Planet Foundation. 
DOWNCYCLING
Items that could not be donated or  
upcycled were downcycled or converted  
into items of lesser value. Leftover fabric  
from Delta uniforms was turned into  
home insulation, pillows, pet bed  
stuffing and more.

910Delta’s success in connecting global communities on the ground and in the air is 
credited solely to our more than 80,000 employees. Taking care of them is our top  
priority. We are proud that they are the best-performing, best-compensated aviation  
professionals in the industry. Among the ways we demonstrate our commitment 
to Delta people:
•  Consistent pay increases — 10 times over the past  
10 years, increasing total annual compensation  
80 percent since 2008. Base pay has increased more 
than 30 percent on average in the past five years.
•  Strong, middle-class jobs, for example, 
ramp agents earn starting salaries that are 
nearly $18 an hour; airport agents and flight 
attendants earns $74,000 and mechanics earn 
$121,000 annually after 12 years of service.
•  The industry’s best profit-sharing plan, and most likely 
in the U.S., with effectively 15 percent of company profits 
go to employees, in addition to their salary. For the past 
five years, payouts have been in excess of $1 billion.•  An industry-leading 401(k) plan that provides up  
to a 9 percent contribution from Delta, including a  
3 percent company investment and a 6 percent  
dollar-for-dollar match when the plan member 
contributes 6 percent. In addition, we have funded  
$7 billion into pensions plans over the past five years.
Our commitment to our people is matched by their 
loyalty to us. Delta’s average attrition rate is below 
5 percent, significantly under the industry average, 
and average seniority is 16 years. Delta people show 
every day their commitment to each other, our 
customers and our communities and that’s why we 
put them at the heart of every decision we make.OUR BEST CONNECTION:

CUL TURE AND 
ENGAGEMENT
The “Delta Difference” separates us from  
our competitors. Since 1929, Delta people 
have worked diligently to build our record 
for delivering safe, high-quality service and 
for acting with honesty, integrity, respect, 
perseverance and servant leadership in all  
we do. We are proud of this legacy.
Our long history of building and nurturing our culture has earned us deep emotional connections with our 
employees and shared values of honesty, integrity and respect. We care for these connections through ongoing 
and active listening, including formal mechanisms such as ongoing employee engagement surveys, and a 
variety of informal measures. And we share our success with the people who make it possible, as evidenced 
by our attractive total rewards package and industry-leading profit sharing program. 
Delta consistently ranks on national lists for both employee engagement and customer loyalty. For the 
second straight year, in fact, Delta landed on Forbes’ 100 Best Companies to Work For list, the only airline 
to do so. This is no accident. Satisfied employees make for satisfied customers, who in turn make us a 
more successful business. The fuel for this virtuous cycle is our investment in our people. We will continue 
this journey by putting people first: refining our talent attraction and retention practices, rewarding high 
performance, providing opportunities to learn and develop, and cultivating a diverse and inclusive place 
to work.
A primary way we measure employee satisfaction is through a company-wide employee survey. Nearly 
48,000 Delta employees—60 percent—participated in the 2018 Employee Survey. For the sixth year in a 
row, we achieved our goal for positive employee engagement, with a score of 85 percent. The four highest 
positive response rates were for questions about:
• Understanding how employees’ daily work impacts the company’s overall goals
• Understanding and supporting Delta’s basic principles and core values
• Employee pride in telling others they work for Delta
• Employee likelihood to refer a friend or family member to work for Delta
Beyond this survey, Delta employees also are heard through division-specific engagement surveys 
provided annually on an employee’s hire date and division-specific employee engagement groups. In 
addition, the Delta Board Council consists of a representative from every major noncontract operating 
division and ensures that employee voices are heard at the Board of Directors level. Our Business Resource 
Groups (BRGs) and our internal social media platform SkyHub are also important engagement channels  
for employees and leaders. • American Heart Association Workplace Health

These documents describe and reinforce the fundamental values and basic behaviors required of all 
employees and what we promise as a company in return—including a commitment to our long-standing 
Open Door policy. In addition to helping Delta employees conduct business ethically, the Delta Code of 
Ethics and Business Conduct also helps our business partners understand how we conduct business, 
and it provides key compliance policies that apply to interactions around the world.
While Delta’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is an important reference, understandably it cannot 
describe every law and Delta standard that applies to our business. That is why we expect employees and 
partners to let their actions be guided by all three documents. 
All Delta employees must read, understand and follow Delta’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct,  
as well as reporting violations or suspected violations. Speaking up about behavior that may be a violation 
of the Delta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct or our values allows Delta to address issues as they 
arise. Employees are encouraged to report suspicions to their supervisor or other manager; their HR 
representative or the Law Department. If an employee is uncomfortable reporting through one of these 
channels, they can always report through DeltaHelpLine.com.
SAFETY, ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE HELPLINE
If an employee, partner or customer wants to report an incident or raise a safety, ethics or compliance 
concern, they can contact the Delta Safety, Ethics and Compliance Helpline. The Helpline is available 
toll-free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by calling 1-800-253-7879 within the U.S. and Canada. Concerns 
also maybe be reported online at DeltaHelpLine.com.
Reports to the Helpline are answered discreetly and confidentially by an independent company that helps 
us respond to concerns. If an investigation is necessary, it happens promptly and, if appropriate, corrective 
actions are taken. Delta does not tolerate retaliation of any kind for raising concerns or making a report in 
good faith about a safety, ethics or compliance issue. Delta will take appropriate disciplinary action, up to 
and including termination, against individuals who retaliate. Our culture is our most important 
competitive advantage. Each 
and every Delta employee has 
a responsibility to protect and 
preserve it. They play a key role 
in maintaining Delta’s reputation 
as a safe, reliable airline built on a 
foundation of honesty, integrity, 
respect, perseverance and servant 
leadership. Delta’s Code of Ethics 
and Business Conduct helps 
employees better understand 
their role in protecting Delta’s 
values, culture and reputation. 
Delta conducts all business ethically and in compliance 
with the law. This nonnegotiable policy is critical to 
maintaining Delta’s high level of performance, as well as 
our well-earned reputation for excellence and integrity. We 
run our business using the following three documents as 
our primary guide:
•   Rules of the Road, which is our foundation and outlines  
 core values, principles and expectations of modeling  
 leadership at every level of the company. 
•   The Way We Fly , which outlines our basic expectations  
 of each other as employees. 
•   The Delta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which  
 defines how we conduct business around the world. UPHOLDING
OUR VALUESTHROUGH EMPATHYA BETTER CONNECTION
ETHICS IN ACTION
In 2018, we delivered 19 live training sessions to more than 3,000 of our 
colleagues globally on topics including anti-trust, conflicts of interest, anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption, insider trading, and trade sanctions and restrictions. We 
provide the Delta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct online course to all Delta 
merit employees and contractors annually and update content so that materials 
remain fresh. During 2018, 14,176 employees and contractors completed the 
course, a 97 percent completion rate for the relevant population. Starting in 2019, 
we will conduct a focused effort to achieve 100 percent completion of online 
mandatory training. 
We also continued to expand the variety and reach of Ethics and Compliance 
program communications by:
• Publishing featured articles on our internal, employee-focused intranet; 
• Distributing printed materials throughout the company;
• Building a central, online home for employees to access policies and  
 compliance information; 
• Creating videos by Delta officers who discuss what compliance means to  
 their business units for use in live and online trainings.
Delta also provides anti-bribery and anti-corruption training to all Delta personnel 
and agents who may interact with foreign officials on Delta matters. We have 
significantly increased the frequency of in-person training on Delta’s Code of Ethics 
and Business Conduct, in particular anti-bribery and anti-trust topics. We now also 
have online anti-trust training available to employees.HUMAN RIGHTS
Delta condemns all forms of human rights abuses, including human trafficking 
and sexual exploitation of children. We fully support and respect the principles 
set forth in various international and domestic modern slavery and anti-human 
trafficking laws, which is consistent with our core values and commitment to be a 
force for global good. Through our support of human rights, we actively take our 
responsibility as a global citizen seriously and proudly continue to evolve and take 
actions to be the leading force against human trafficking in the airline industry. 
Throughout 2018, Delta rolled out new signs in airports across the U.S. to raise 
awareness of human trafficking. The signs serve multiple goals, including helping 
to teach the public about indicators of trafficking and to highlight the National 
Human Trafficking Hotline number. The signs also create additional opportunities 
for educating the extended Delta global family to learn and recognize the signs of 
trafficking, while providing a means to report anything suspicious.
During the year, our In-Flight Service training department released new mandatory 
quarterly training for all flight attendants. Also released was an optional computer-
based training module that is now available to our 80,000 employees worldwide. 
To build even more momentum around human trafficking education and awareness, 
we held events in April 2018 and in January 2019 for more than 500 employees in 
collaboration with our longstanding partners Polaris, Street Grace, Freedom United 
and End Child Prostitution and Trafficking (ECPAT).
In addition to training, we continue to be a force for global good by building human 
rights volunteer opportunities through nonprofit organizations that include Freedom 
Rings, Freedom United and WellSpring Living. These volunteer efforts allow Delta 
people to directly engage the communities where we live and work in support of 
women’s shelters and other organizations that serve human trafficking survivors. 
“ From Jeanie’s reminder that everyone has a story to Customer 
Experience Vice President Charisse Evans’ talk on experimentation 
and continuous improvement—the event was a compelling learning 
experience. It also reaffirmed what we do every day at Delta,” said 
attendee Lori Spellman, In-Flight Service base manager.
19In a business focused on service and hospitality, there is no such 
thing as demonstrating too much empathy when dealing with both 
customers and fellow employees. That was the thought behind 
gathering Delta people, from frontline employees to directors, 
at “Destination Tomorrow: Together with TED” to learn from TED 
fellows, hear from leaders and participate in discussions on how 
empathy contributes to unmatched customer service. Colleagues 
shared best practices and brainstormed ideas in support of the 
concept during the day-long event. 
Tim Moye, manager of the Delta Care and Scholarship Funds, shared 
a powerful story on his work as founder of Wrenched Hearts, an 
employee group for grieving parents. Wrapping up the day, Jeanie 
Brady, a flight attendant, left participants with a lot to think about 
from her talk, “Practicing Kindness at 35,000 Feet.” TALENT

Delta employees are grouped into two categories for compensation purposes: 
scale and merit employees. The latter includes a broad mix of leaders and 
individual contributors who are paid a salary. We track pay for merit employees 
by using data to benchmark their compensation relative to their peers at Delta 
and across multiple industries. Merit employees’ job performance is evaluated 
based on skill, experience, innovation, effort and leadership. 
Scale employees, who include pilots, flight attendants, maintenance 
technicians, Airport Customer Service agents, baggage handlers and others, 
are paid an hourly wage. Delta’s leadership position in the industry allows 
us to pay scale employees competitively and reward excellent performance. 
We offer pay premiums based on job function and work rules that provide 
a balance of flexibility, productivity and quality of work life. Benefits are 
competitive and flexible and include paid time off, retirement savings and 
comprehensive health care coverage. On Oct. 1, 2018, eligible scale and merit 
employees received up to a 3 percent increase in base pay. 
For all employees, competitive base pay is one piece of a larger compensation 
pie that includes added rewards and benefits. Our profit sharing program 
leads the industry and recognizes our employees’ contributions in meeting 
Delta’s financial targets.
For the fourth year in a row we have paid out more than $1 billion annually 
through the program, more than any other company. This plan, combined 
with highly competitive base pay and monthly Shared Rewards bonuses paid Our success as a business depends on every 
Delta employee at every level, and we believe 
in rewarding them for the success they help 
to create. Our competitive and generous 
compensation philosophy is also designed to 
help us recruit and retain talented employees.
for meeting operational targets, has resulted in an 80 percent increase in total 
annual compensation since 2008. Our people can further share in our financial 
success through an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). This plan allows 
employees to use payroll deductions to purchase Delta stock. 
The Shared Rewards program helps incentivize employees to deliver safe, 
on-time, best-in-class travel to our customers. Eligible employees can earn a 
monthly cash bonus based on achieving the specific operational goals in the 
categories of baggage handling, completion factor, on-time arrivals and domestic 
Net Promoter Score. Employees earn $25 for meeting or exceeding one goal, $50 
for two, $75 for three and $100 for all four, with a maximum payout of $1,200 per 
year for U.S.-based employees. Eligible international employees participate in 
Shared Rewards with target payout values appropriate for each country. 
Executive compensation is aligned with compensation for all Delta employees 
but is also dependent on the airline’s performance, which includes environmental, 
social and governance factors. The Personnel & Compensation Committee of 
the Board of Directors sets evaluation criteria and compensation for the CEO 
and reviews and approves compensation for other officers. The Committee also 
produces an annual report on executive compensation for inclusion in Delta’s 
proxy statement, in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. 
Delta supports flexible employment arrangements. Ready Reserve employees are 
eligible to work fewer weekly hours; are paid on the same pay scale as full-time 
customer service agents; and receive profit sharing, Shared Rewards, 401(k) REWARDING THE

21savings and travel privileges. In most locations, Ready Reserve employees are not 
eligible to participate in health and welfare plans. The Reservation Sales Work @ Home  
program allows employees to receive the same benefits as full-time employees 
without the time and expense of traveling between home and the engagement call 
center. Employees must live within a three-hour drive of the center to be eligible. 
Delta employees also care deeply for one another, as seen through the work of two 
internal funds created by employees, for employees. The Delta Employee & Retiree Care Fund supports individuals who suffer from severe financial hardship 
resulting from unforeseen and unavoidable crises such as natural disasters. 
This fund distributed $3.6 million in grants to employees and $1.5 million in 
disaster relief in 2018. The Delta Scholarship Fund helps employees and eligible 
family members achieve their dreams of furthering their education. The Fund  
has awarded more than $5 million in scholarships since it launched in 2008, and 
550 employees and dependents received scholarships worth $1.35 million for  
the 2018-2019 school year.

TALENT
Delta employees working together as one made Delta the Most 
Awarded Airline in 2017. To commemorate this milestone and 
honor their performance and hard work, we created a puzzle from 
the hull of a retired Delta 747, which was unveiled on our 2018 
Profit Sharing Day at the Delta Flight Museum. Delta employees 
earned a $1.1 billion payout for their role in delivering record-breaking 
operational and customer satisfaction performance as well  
as strong financial performance.
Following the ceremony, each of Delta’s more than 80,000 
employees received a puzzle piece engraved with their name, 
serving as a constant reminder of the importance and impact of 
their efforts working together for the company’s success.For 90 years, Delta has fostered one of the most engaged and loyal 
workforces of any airline in the world. To continue our tradition of excellence, 
we follow a human capital development strategy that is rooted in our shared 
values of honesty, integrity, respect, perseverance and servant leadership. We 
work hard to hire people steeped in these values so they can help perpetuate 
our unique culture. Delta reinforces these values through an experiential 
onboarding process, continuous development and coaching opportunities, 
recognition for hard work and an industry-leading compensation philosophy.
We continue to update those strategies to keep pace with workplace 
trends. Today’s job seekers are looking for positions that did not exist a 
decade ago and are finding information about these jobs in new ways. 
They want careers that are dynamic, with the opportunity to develop and 
take on new roles over time. Delta, too, has evolved over time. We are in 
a strong financial position, with goals of becoming one of the top service 
brands in any industry. These aspirations demand top talent to match.
 
Industry dynamics also drive recruitment efforts. As more people embrace 
air travel, we require more employees to support seasonal surges in demand 
and respond to new risks. Recruiting the next generation of employees 
21to replace those retiring from key technical roles—especially pilots and 
mechanics—is also a major focus. In the coming five years, we plan to hire 
approximately 25,000 employees, including more than 8,000 pilots to staff 
flights around the world as other pilots reach mandatory retirement age. 
In 2018, we completed the build-out of our hiring team within Delta, allowing 
us to use our own expertise to recruit from within and reduce our reliance on 
third-party agency partners. With unemployment at a 10-year low, however, 
competition for talent has increased. This means we must develop even more 
creative ways to attract talent.
Preparing aspiring aviation professionals to take the helm from retiring 
employees is a priority. We have partnerships with more than 47 maintenance 
training programs across the U.S. to help identify, mentor and source the next 
generation of aviation maintenance technicians. Through these partnerships, 
we offer tours, job shadows and career guidance for the schools, as well as 
training opportunities for instructors. Where possible, we donate serviceable 
parts, engines and airframes to give students even more real-world maintenance 
experience working with jet aircraft components. In 2018, The Delta Air Lines 
Foundation issued $350,000 of grants to nine Aviation Maintenance training 
programs nationwide. The grants will allow the programs to enhance 
their curriculum development, projects and material support, 
increasing students’ awareness, knowledge and skills of 
avionics, electrical and composite structures. 
22
Delta and The Delta Air Lines Foundation invest strategically in education to 
develop future talent. In 2018, Delta, The Delta Air Lines Foundation and the 
Jacobson Family Foundation contributed a combined $6.2 million to support 
aviation programs at Auburn University. The funding provided will allow Auburn 
students to learn to fly and pursue aviation careers at Auburn University Regional 
Airport. The Delta Air Lines Foundation also provided a $2 million grant to 
Georgia State University’s J. Mack Robinson College of Business to open the new 
Delta Student Success Center. 
We have partnered with and created many successful experiential educational 
programs to get school students excited about STEM and aviation careers. 
Delta provided scholarships to over 600 students, grades seven through 12, 
to participate in a week-long immersive learning adventure camp aboard 
the world’s largest simulated aircraft carrier at the National Flight Academy 
in Pensacola, Florida. Delta hires 400 new interns or co-ops each year to 
experience programs in almost every division throughout our organization. 
Delta has long been committed to hiring veterans and reservists, employing over 
10,000 veterans. This year, job-seeker site indeed.com recognized Delta as a top 
workplace for veterans. Delta was an early adopter of the Veterans Job Mission’s 
goal to hire 1 million veterans and takes a multipronged approach of 
community outreach and strategic partnerships to hire veterans. TALENT

DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTOur efforts to identify, select and develop the next generation 
of pilots expanded significantly in 2018 with the launch of the 
Delta Propel Pilot Career Path Program.
This innovative program has three main areas of focus—
college, company and community. This three-pronged 
approach will help Delta support future aviators as well as 
current Delta employees who have a passion for aviation and 
strong interest in becoming a Delta pilot. The Propel Program 
supplements our current recruiting structure, which includes 
recruiting and hiring pilots currently flying in the airline, 
military and corporate sectors.
Delta conducted several years of research to create the 
pilot outreach and pathway program, including listening to 
feedback from students, parents, faculty, administrators and 
Delta employees to help overcome barriers for potential pilot 
candidates such as career path uncertainty and the Certificated 
Flight Instructor shortage.
The program takes a holistic approach to expanding the 
opportunities available to aspiring pilots. The College path 
focuses on partnerships with universities and accredited 
aviation programs for the student interview and selection 
process and an advanced engagement opportunity to immerse 
students in the Delta culture on and off campus with the 
support of a Delta pilot mentor. The Company path provides 
current Delta employees a career transition opportunity to 
pursue a pilot career. A limited number of candidates will be 
chosen each year and will be provided with a Qualified Job 
Offer detailing a defined path and timeline to become a  
Delta pilot.
The Community component of the program involves leveraging 
current relationships with aviation organizations and 
establishing new ones to identify and support aspiring pilots, 
including engagement with kindergarten through high school 
students. Delta also will provide scholarships, engagement 
and mentoring to increase the diversity of its candidate pool 
through the Propel Community Outreach path. TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF PILOTSA BETTER CONNECTION

An important way we retain the brightest talent is by providing opportunities to 
grow within Delta. That’s why we’ve invested $50 million to modernize our human 
resources technology offerings, including those supporting career development. 
Today, we provide a range of talent development opportunities, including mandatory 
compliance training, new hire training and general professional development. We also 
support employees informally with coaching, mentoring and performance support 
as needed. Our online learning database allows employees to view all resources 
that Delta offers in one place, from webinars to in-person workshops. In 2018 Delta 
also launched a customer experience training for frontline employees following the 
success of a 2017 pilot program. 
PERFORMANCE & REVIEWS
Every year, merit employees, who make up 11 percent of our workforce, participate 
in a performance management process which helps support their career development 
goals. In 2018, 87.89 percent of merit employees completed these reviews. Career 
development and growth for merit employees is focused around four key activities: 
• Performance Planning through which employees create performance  
 objectives aligned to the goals of their manager, division and the  
 overall corporation. 
• Individual Development Plans are utilized by employees and managers to plan  
 and track focused developmental activities in identified skills or behaviors.
• Ongoing Check-In Conversations occur throughout the year between  
 employees and their managers on the progress being made toward goals  
 and an employee’s development. 
•  Year-End Conversations are a final check-in to review an employee’s progress 
over the last year toward goals achievement and to ensure individual 
performance is aligned with behaviors in Delta’s Rules of the Road. 
Beyond formal performance management, feedback and coaching conversations 
are scheduled quarterly to ensure employees have the guidance and information 
they need to continuously grow.Training Hours per Employee by Division

In addition to comprehensive health care coverage, Delta offers dental, 
vision and flexible spending account benefits to eligible employees. To 
promote disease prevention, employees enrolled in a Delta Account-Based 
Healthcare Plan are covered at 100 percent for preventive care services 
based on the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task 
Force (USPSTF). Beyond USPSTF recommendations, employees covered 
by Delta’s medical plans receive other preventive services such as travel 
immunizations and assistance with health care questions and needs 
through the Delta Health Direct program. In addition, employees and 
their eligible family members have access to Delta’s Employee Assistance 
Program, which offers confidential counseling, assessment and referral 
service support.
As of January 2017, U.S.-based expectant mothers in all ground and flight 
attendant positions, including Ready Reserve and Flex @ Home, receive a 
minimum six weeks at 100 percent pay for maternity leave. In addition, all 
mothers and fathers may take a 30-day unpaid bonding leave following 
the birth, adoption, guardianship or fostering of a child once paid maternity 
leave (if applicable) and/or other Family Medical Leave Act benefits have 
been exhausted.
Through Delta Health Rewards, a voluntary, incentive-based wellness 
program, we help U.S. employees and their spouses reach health goals. 
Participants earn rewards dollars by completing specific health actions 
such as undergoing an annual physical exam, completing an online health

TRAVEL AND WORK HEAL TH
To continually ensure the health of all Delta employees, numerous employee medical surveillance 
programs, screenings and safety trainings are conducted at Delta airport stations. Programs included:
• Implementing WHO International Health Regulation pertaining to Lifetime Yellow Fever vaccination  
 status while maintaining optional 10-year revaccination benefit at the employee’s option.
• Maintaining crew and other employee business traveler awareness around Zika risk and  
 prevention strategies. Travelers could avoid destinations with active Zika transmission secondary  
 to pregnancy considerations.
• Leading the placement of a CPR automated training kiosk at Gate A11 of Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson  
 International Airport. Its aim is to engage and educate passengers on CPR techniques in less than  
 15 minutes.
Our employees travel to all parts of the world, which can occasionally expose them to disease outbreaks 
and other health risks. To address these challenges, we provide our employees on Delta business travel  
with travel health consultation and company-paid vaccine coverage, anti-malaria medication and  
insect repellent.
Delta’s medical plans also provide travel vaccine coverage for global travel by employees and covered 
family members. Separate Delta internal programs target prevention of illness among employees who 
travel internationally on company business, especially to developing countries with risks of malaria, 
yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, food/waterborne illness and other diseases that may occur as 
outbreaks. Employee education focuses on promoting awareness about the use of personal protection 
measures, early symptom recognition, a 24/7 malaria hotline and prompt medical treatment.
Delta also provides top-tier global medical assistance to help employees who become ill or injured 
while traveling internationally on company business. Through telephone conversations available 24/7, 
employees can be referred for a hotel physician visit, a doctor’s office appointment or an emergency 
room visit. Case management continues until the ill employee can travel back home. In rare circumstances, 
we can dispatch an air ambulance staffed with a highly skilled transport team of health care professionals.

DIVERSITY, INCLUSION 
& EQUITY
With a goal to strengthen our connections from the inside out, Delta’s 
diversity and inclusion strategy focuses on three strategic imperatives: 
seeking diversity, promoting inclusion and driving accountability. The 
strategy is supported and measured by Delta Vision 2020, a three-year 
plan to increase diversity, particularly in leadership roles. Delta Vision 
2020 is supported by Delta’s Diversity Council, which is composed of 
senior leaders across the company to ensure greater accountability. 
In late 2018, Delta Air Lines joined hundreds of companies across the U.S.  
in the first-ever National Day of Understanding for diversity and inclusion. 
Companies that participated, including Delta, are members of the CEO 
Action for Diversity & Inclusion, a coalition committed to creating a safe 
workplace environment for dialogue, addressing and mitigating unconscious 
biases, and sharing best practices.
BUSINESS RESOURCE GROUPS 
Delta’s employee-led groups continue to contribute to a more inclusive and 
engaged climate across the organization’s global footprint. Our Business 
Resource Groups (BRGs) and four employee involvement groups provide 
professional development, drive employee and community engagement, 
and serve as a source for new and innovative business solutions. For more than 90 years, Delta has been in the 
business of bringing people together. As a global 
airline, we believe that our company must reflect  
the diversity of the world and serve as a model  
of inclusiveness. 
In addition, two employee peer support groups provide a support system for 
Delta employees affected by cancer or for parents who have lost children. 
These groups ensure that a diverse and inclusive voice remains an intrinsic 
component of the decision-making process. They also demonstrate Delta’s 
shared values of treating one another with dignity and respect. The growth 
and influence of BRGs has been impressive and impactful in creating a more 
inclusive and engaged culture. In 2018, BRG membership grew by 35 percent. 
To strengthen diversity, we have shifted our external recruiting strategy  
to build stronger partnerships with local and regional diverse professional 
organizations. We also are developing strategies to leverage BRGs as talent 
ambassadors, as well as increasing the number of diverse candidates in 
final interview slates. It is equally important to increase internal mobility 
for existing diverse employees. To do so we are working with leaders and 
divisional functions to strengthen the pipeline of employees considered 
for promotions, lateral moves and professional development. Our BRGs are often a powerful voice for improvements in the workplace and the source 
of innovative ideas. In 2018, ABLE provided guidance that led Delta to start encouraging 
employees and customers with disabilities to self-identify for their own personal safety 
while flying.
“Many Delta employees are not aware of the powerful role BRGs play within the 
company,” said Ryan Di Giovanni, Delta Senior Analyst—Revenue Management and Vice 
President of ABLE. “Delta’s leadership team not only listens but often turns suggestions 
into action. This is one of the reasons that Delta culture is unique and helps to make the 
Delta difference for employees.”
In addition to ABLE, Delta regularly receives input from its Advisory Board on Disability 
(ABD), a group of 13 influencers and decision-makers from various groups within the 
disability community who are also Delta frequent flyers. This year, Delta hosted its 10th 
annual Advisory Board on Disability meeting where Delta employees and board members 
met to discuss and share recommendations on compliance, training, policies, procedures 
and anything impacting the travel experience of people with disabilities. Recently, the 
board offered recommendations for Delta’s assistive device damage reduction strategy, 
service animal policies and inclusive marketing tactics, resulting in new policies and 
solutions to improve the travel experiences of customers with disabilities.A BETTER CONNECTION THROUGH LISTENING

27A MORE INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE
Promoting inclusion through training is a priority for 
us. In 2017, approximately 80 percent of leaders 
participated in Infinite Differences, a half-day diversity 
education experience focused on unconscious bias and 
how to lead with inclusion. In 2019, Delta will launch 
the next phase of diversity education to expand the 
inclusion skills and competencies of leaders. 
Creating an inclusive environment in a predominantly 
male-dominated industry means advocating for, and 
championing, women. Delta works to dismantle 
barriers to career entry and advancement, with  
19 female leaders in officer positions. Conversations 
about women in the workplace are encouraged 
through the BRG SHE, and women are invited to offer 
input on decisions that could predominantly affect 
women, such as maternity leave. Delta achieved pay 
parity in both administrative and front-line roles this 
year, but we recognize that there is more work to be 
done. Delta is also committed to serving women in 
the wider community through its fight against human 
trafficking, a crime which largely exploits women 
and children.
To support career advancement, Delta hosts 
professional development summits in partnership 
with its BRGs and external professional organizations 
led by women and people of color. In 2018, we hosted 
the Hispanic Corporate Council of Atlanta’s annual 
forum in partnership with the company’s Latin 
American BRG, providing a unique opportunity for 
over 100 of our employees to network with Delta 
executives and many other Fortune 500 companies. 
We reach a broad range of diverse groups through 
sponsorships, professional development and early 
career programs. Our early outreach to minority 
groups aims to break down barriers to the industry 
and expose students to relatable and inspiring 
role models. For example, Delta’s partnership with 
the Organization of Black Aviation Professionals’ 
(OBAP) ACE Academy and Solo Flight programs 
introduce high school students of color to careers in 
aviation. Delta’s all-female “WING” Flight, standing 
for “Women Inspiring our Next Generation,” exposes 
over 100 girls ages 12 to 18 to airline careers. Delta 
also sponsored and participated in several PRIDE 
events in U.S. cities and in London to promote our Business Resource Groups

Delta extends its values of diversity and inclusion to our supply chain. The diversity clause in our supplier code 
requires contractors to acknowledge Delta’s commitment to enhancing business opportunities for small business, 
including minority, veteran, disabled, LGBTQ and women-owned small businesses as first- and second-tier 
suppliers, so long as they are competitive on price, quality and service. In 2018, we spent $832 million on these 
diverse small business contracts, an 8 percent increase over 2017. We also honored our top diverse suppliers and 
supplier diversity advocates at our 19th Annual Star Awards recognition event. IN THIS CHAPTER

2829Delta’s unwavering commitment to 
improving safety performance across 
all aspects of the business mirrors our 
commitment to sustaining industry-  
leading operational performance 
and reliability. Our brand is tightly 
tied to customer satisfaction, and 
safety is a foundational expectation 
that also supports and enables 
improvements in performance  
and reliability.Safety is a fundamental value at Delta and woven into everything we do. This means we are never satisfied with our 
safety performance, even in areas where we lead the industry. As a shared value, safety connects us as a company 
globally—whether taking care of a sick passenger on a flight from Tokyo to Los Angeles, replacing a worn tire in 
Atlanta, completing a pre-flight checklist in London or inspecting ramp vehicles for safety in New York.
 
We apply the same rigor and systematic approach to monitoring and enhancing our flight safety and reporting 
programs, maintenance reliability systems and personal safety programs as we do to our other operational 
processes. The outputs of these processes are regularly reviewed by Delta leaders in monthly and quarterly 
performance and analysis reviews, up to and including our Board-level committee on safety and security. 
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
At the heart of all Delta’s safety programs is our Safety Management System (SMS) that establishes the expectations 
for safety performance and defines the tools and methodologies to guide, assess and improve safety every day. 
Whether we are protecting our employees, customers, business partners or airplanes, Delta believes in a 
structured approach to safety management.
 
The Delta SMS includes four key elements: Safety Policy, Safety Risk Management, Safety Assurance and Safety 
Promotion. These four pillars establish the framework to ensure we manage risk, supported by strong safety 
leadership commitment at every level. The SMS is an integrated approach that is applied to safety management 
across our business and involves everyone in the organization with a role to identify concerns.

SAFETY30
DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTNEW INITIATIVES IN 2018
In the air, our In-Flight Service team has leveraged the CARE model to develop 
an engagement program for frontline leaders to engage positively with flight 
attendants during a flight. Leaders identify any at-risk behaviors or concerns, 
but are focused on recognizing and thanking flight attendants for doing the right 
thing. This is simply called the CARE Program. 
Another In-Flight Service Safety Program that has proven extremely powerful 
is “Moments of Truth.” Five specific scenarios were identified where flight 
attendants might be conflicted: “Do I do the right thing for customer experience, 
or do I do the right thing for safety?” Leaders very clearly and consistently 
communicated that they would support flight attendants for doing the right 
thing for safety.
In 2018 we hired over 2,000 new flight attendants. To ensure they understood the 
importance of safety in their new role, In-Flight Service developed Safety Learning 
Maps to address common safety scenarios both on-board and during layovers. In 
their second month of flying, our new-hire flight attendants participated in highly 
interactive sessions with their peers to select the right safety response for each 
scenario and discuss why they made their choice.Delta’s SMS has matured into a strong, successful and healthy foundation for 
managing risk across our daily operational processes. The keys to its success  
are employee engagement, leadership accountability and communication. Our 
frontline employees are the eyes and ears of our operation and are best positioned 
to identify hazards and offer solutions. Constant analysis of systems, processes and 
procedures provides ongoing opportunities to proactively identify hazards before 
an incident occurs. In 2018 our SMS is well deployed with broad scope to the point 
where it is acknowledged to be the “way we do things around here.”
BUILDING A SAFER WORKPLACE
We recognize that reducing injuries at work is achieved by:
• Advancing our safety culture to support open reporting, greater focus and  
 awareness of hazards and demonstrating that we care about all employees  
 and business partners
• Changing the way work is done in order to mitigate injury, whether through  
 training, modifying processes or investing in new equipment
We believe that safety starts with great safety leaders. The Delta CARE model 
that was introduced in 2017 has been integrated into our human resources and 
leadership programs to clearly define and reinforce the desired safety competencies 
and behaviors:

The CARE model is a foundational component of our new manager training and 
leadership development courses in which we describe “what great safety leadership 
looks like.”
Delta is focused on a new training approach to embed safety into employees’ daily 
routines. In 2018 we completed over 20 Reflective Learning sessions with leadership 
groups. In these sessions, participants reflected on their safety behaviors and actions 
—both successes and disappointments. Leaders reviewed recent incidents by asking 
“How did we as leaders contribute to these events?” and “What is our role in preventing future incidents?” Each team took away rich learnings and a realistic set 
of actions within their control they could take to make a difference. These Reflective 
Learning events are just one example of how we are promoting conversations about 
safety to be reflective, humble and lead to proactive changes.

Delta line maintenance employees Adam Momeyer, based in Honolulu, and  
E.J. Esposito, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, recently demonstrated the Delta 
LIVESAFE mindset when saving lives after witnessing a helicopter crash. While 
kayaking in Hawaii on their days off, Adam, E.J. and his girlfriend, Carly, spotted 
a helicopter plummeting into the water yards ahead of them. They reacted 
instantly. Adam called 911 and E.J. and Carly swam to the helicopter where they 
found the pilot drifting in and out of consciousness and two other passengers 
alert but injured. E.J. rendered first aid to the passengers, while Carly held the 
pilot’s head above water until emergency response teams arrived to transport 
the crash victims to a local hospital. 
Some may say it is impossible to prepare for situations like this, but for Delta 
employees, anticipating all possible outcomes is crucial for job safety and 
accuracy. “I try to expect the unexpected and always be alert in life,” E.J. said. “At 
work, we don’t skimp on safety, and we pay close attention to detail—both of 
which are qualities that were essential when responding to the crash.”DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
To further boost safety awareness this year, we continued to promote and 
reinforce The Lifesavers, which are lifesaving rules established across all 
divisions in late 2017. This initiative included testimonial training videos 
featuring lessons learned from employees who sustained an injury. Our own 
“Havoc” character, who promotes safety by naughtily encouraging unsafe 
behaviors around the workplace, also starred in a number of Lifesaver training 
videos in 2018. This innovative and engaging awareness training continues to 
be both well-received and remembered.
In addition to preventing employee injuries, Delta also implements programs to 
prevent work-related health issues. In 2018, as an example, we provided employees 
traveling internationally on company business with global medical assistance 
through SOS-MedAire. This global medical assistance ensured that approximately 
1,000 flight attendant trainees had the opportunity to be vaccinated against 
yellow fever in 2018, following several outbreaks in South America.
Delta held its second annual companywide Safety Day in 2018. This year’s 
theme asked employees “How Do You Stay Safe?” and encouraged them to 
share stories about their experiences and how they keep themselves and 
others safe. The 2018 event engaged a far broader cross-section of the Delta 
population, and we expect to evolve and build on the Safety Day design 
going forward.
Finally, we continue to emphasize that safety extends beyond the workplace 
though our mission: “LIVESAFE—At Work, At Home, At Play.” This message reflects 
our understanding that the best way to support our employees and realize lasting 
change is by incorporating safe behaviors into all aspects of our daily lives. STOP—

An exceptional example of what it means to serve others while maintaining 
safety-first core values, Adam, E.J. and Carly embody what it means to LIVESAFE

USING TECHNOLOGY TO STAY SAFE
A number of dedicated efforts were made in 2018 to improve both the working 
environment and the equipment our employees and partners utilize daily.
 
Our Airport Customer Service (ACS) team continues to look at ways to minimize 
the exposures inherent in working on the ramp and handling bags. We 
introduced 39 power stow belt loaders in 2018 with plans for another 55 in 
2019. These belt loaders reduce the exposure of baggage handlers to motion-
related injuries while manually stacking bags in the aircraft hold. We continue 
to look at a number of potential solutions and technologies that would 
reduce the number of touch points our ACS teams make with bags. Another 
technology-driven solution introduced by ACS in 2018 was a new safety app 
that allows employees and leaders to report hazards, conduct safety audits 
and complete safety observations—all on their mobile device.
Following the introduction of IOS system devices for flight attendants and pilots in 
2018, we continue to add to our existing range of apps to make reporting easier 
for our employees. One example is turbulence surveys to support simpler 
reporting by flight attendants of the critical facts following a turbulence event. 
Another highly successful In-Flight Service initiative is a robust tagging and 
tracking system to ensure broken carts are systematically removed from the system 
and repaired. Cart injuries are among the most common injuries among flight 
attendants. In TechOps our maintenance team identified a systemic problem with 
ladders and stands being used incorrectly across the system and posing a risk. 
Following a rigorous review and an inventory of stock, additional ladders and 
stands were introduced across the system, and new guidance issued for which 
specific ladder/stand to use for specific tasks.
RECOGNIZING SAFE FACILITIES 
Delta’s Quality Assurance (QA) team conducts audits at our airports to review 
required documentation and interview employees to confirm that safety 
expectations are met. In 2018, this team completed over 1,000 detailed safety 
audits across our domestic and international airports. These reports go along 
with leadership’s local self-audits to identify areas that need attention. Data 
from these evaluations also are used when investigating incidents to correlate 
causal factors and identify topics that may need systemwide attention.
Delta is proud to have 21 OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star 
locations in the United States and is still the only major airline with OSHA 
Corporate VPP status. In 2018 we added the Iron Range Minnesota Customer 
Engagement Center to our existing list of VPP locations. There are just over 
2,000 VPP sites across the United States.
At Delta’s VPP sites, the rate of on-the-job injury and illness is far lower than the 
industry average: 1.38 injuries per 100 employees, compared to the air transportation 
industry average of 6.6. In addition, the OSHA recordable injury rate at our VPP 
facilities is 61.5 percent better than non-VPP Delta sites and 79 percent better than 
the industry average.

DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTEnsuring the health, safety and 
security of our customers is 
paramount. To fulfill this promise 
to our customers while providing 
the highest levels of service in 
the air and on the ground, we 
ensure that all safety policies and 
procedures either meet or  exceed 
the best safety practices of the 
airline industry.SAFETY 
IN THE SKIES
In most cases, our proactive safety culture allows us to exceed regulatory standards. The goal of Delta’s Flight 
Safety program is to identify and eliminate hazards before they cause injuries to people or damage to aircraft 
or facilities. This includes both how we operate aboard our aircraft and how we respond to external risks and 
that could affect data. 
Onboard recorders measure thousands of aircraft parameters, producing enormous amounts of data that 
allow us to identify vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. Delta Flight Safety employs a data modeling 
and analysis team that continuously monitors system performance to identify risk and implement effective 
operational solutions proactively. The data we gather is also used to produce animated videos that we use  
for training purposes. 
Delta has invested in technology that greatly expands our pilots’ awareness of turbulence and other 
weather conditions. Several years ago, Delta participated in a collaborative project with the FAA and the 
National Center for Atmospheric Research that developed a product called Eddy Dissipation Rate (EDR). 
EDR provides real-time depictions of the location and severity of turbulence in a given area, allowing pilots 
to adjust routes as needed to reduce the potential for an injury and improve customers’ in-flight experience. 
Delta’s proprietary turbulence tool—Delta’s Flight Weather Viewer—is unique in the industry. As we make 
enhancements to in-flight WiFi connectivity, the weather viewer availability is increased.
Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) is the program we use to ensure the safety and efficiency 
of flights. The success of FOQA requires the cooperation of diverse stakeholders and is a testament to the 
strength of relationships and safety focus of the management and labor teams at Delta. Additionally, we use 
this valuable information for predictive maintenance, propulsion engineering and fuel savings.
The Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) is a voluntary reporting best practice for front-line operational 
employees that encourages proactive and confidential hazard and near-miss reporting. ASAP emboldens a 
healthy safety culture through its collaborative approach to risk identification and mitigation—offering Delta 
pilots, mechanics, flight attendants, ACS agents, dispatchers and load planners a human factor-focused 
safety program that allows for group learning and continuous improvement.

DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
ENSURING SECURE FLIGHTS AND RAPID 
EMERGENCY RESPONSE 
Our world is increasingly characterized by geopolitical change and uncertainty. 
This requires us to be ready to respond swiftly to security challenges that 
could threaten our customers or employees. Delta continues to evolve 
our security program, taking a proactive approach to addressing risks and 
minimizing impacts and working with government and airport partners to 
expand customer service security initiatives. In close collaboration with U.S. 
government partners, we conduct regular threat assessments of all locations 
Delta serves to ensure appropriate levels of protection. Delta also relies on 
employees with security clearances to guide our response to emerging or 
existing threats, which could include diverting flights en route to safeguard 
our customers, people and assets—above and beyond government guidance. 
In 2018, our security team implemented a range of initiatives to help ensure the 
safety of our people and campuses. These initiatives included equipment upgrades 
for traffic controls; access control and video monitoring at corporate offices and 
airport facilities; approval of an employee-at-risk framework with a focus on 
foreign travel and executive protection; and enhancement of identification badge 
processes. In response to employee concerns, we also introduced new enterprise-
wide training about how to respond to an armed attack, as well as several initiatives 
aimed at keeping employees more aware of crime patterns and risks.
Delta’s “All Hazards” approach guides our Business Continuity and Emergency 
Response teams in facilitating a companywide framework that proactively 
identifies threats that have the potential to disrupt our business. Some threats 
are outside of Delta’s control; thus our Corporate Crisis Center response protocol 
places less emphasis on the actual event type, and more on the training and 
experience of our divisional responders. Their understanding of our response 
process, along with being closely attuned with how their area of responsibility 
fits into the response process as a whole, allows us to quickly develop an 
incident action plan that guides the strategy for response efforts. This ability 
to manage the business disruption reduces recovery time while providing for 
the safety and security of our customers and employees. Frequent drills and 
simulations keep our responders familiar with response processes and equipped 
to respond at a moment’s notice.
In 2018, Delta initiated an Airport Hub Risk Assessment. The project aims to 
improve our understanding of resiliency associated with our largest hub 
airports. The initial focus on hub airports is due to the magnitude of customer 
impact and the coordination required in the event of a major disruption at a 
large international airport. While the underlying causes of disruptions can vary, 
the end result can mean the cancellation of hundreds of flights, and possibly 
include a full or partial evacuation of the airport. Participating agencies include 
the airport authority, airlines and a multitude of state and federal agencies  
who must all react in a unified manner to ensure the safety and security of  
our traveling public and employees.An important part of Delta’s Emergency Response program is the Delta Care 
Team. This all-volunteer group of employees—more than 2,600 team members 
strong—is highly trained to work with survivors and families impacted by an 
aircraft accident involving a Delta or partner aircraft. This highly diverse team is 
on standby 24/7, ready to deploy anywhere in the world. Their goal is to establish 
immediate and continual communications between Delta and the survivors/
families affected by an accident or incident, and to respond to their needs both 
over the phone and in person. 
SAFETY35
DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTPROTECTING CUSTOMER HEAL TH 
Delta’s commitment to customers’ safety clearly includes taking care of them 
during flight. Our in-flight medical capabilities provide best-in-class safety that 
exceeds FAA regulatory guidance for onboard medical equipment, supplies, 
medication and ground medical physician support through the University 
of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Delta also accommodates passenger-specific, 
battery-operated medical devices, including portable oxygen concentrators that 
have been preapproved by the U.S. Department of Transportation and Delta  
to ensure compatibility with aviation electronic systems.
In rare cases, customers may need assistance that goes beyond the treatment 
we can provide in flight. That’s why we voluntarily contract with STAT-MD, 
a division of emergency medicine services of the University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Center. STAT-MD provides 24/7 ground-based medical support for all 
domestic and international in-flight medical events, in addition to pre-flight 
medical fitness-to-fly consultative support. STAT-MD physician consultants are 
board-certified emergency medicine physicians who understand Delta’s onboard 
medical capabilities and the effects of altitude on physiology in flight. During 
in-flight medical occurrences, these trained physicians consult from the ground 
and provide treatment recommendations, which could include diverting a flight 
to the closest airport to provide a patient with more immediate medical care. 
This consultation happens in collaboration with pilots in the flight deck, flight 
attendant first responders, customer medical volunteers, if available, and the 
flight’s dispatcher from the Operations and Customer Center. 
36
partners every two years. These audits last roughly five days each and 
include hundreds of elements, ranging from flight operations to cabin 
maintenance, in order to meet IATA standards. In between audits, we 
monitor major changes and any safety, security or quality incidents.
We believe that these standards are purely a foundation. The Corporate  
Safety team engages with partners to ensure we are operating at consistent 
levels across our network. Delta and its alliance partners are committed to 
safety and security across all partnerships through:
• Monthly sessions with our Delta Connection partners; each partner reports  
 on safety and security metrics, shares corrective actions and mitigation  
 plans on safety hazards. 
• Routine sessions with heads of safety for each of the 19 SkyTeam partners.  
 This organization includes six working groups that focus on operational  
 safety, ground safety, emergency response, quality and compliance,  
 and security.
• Dedicated sessions with our equity and joint venture partners.  
Delta also participates in and leads multiple industrywide safety initiatives. 
For example, we participate in a working group that uses the FAA’s Aviation 
Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) system. ASIAS promotes 
openly exchanging of de-identified safety information to continuously raise 
awareness and standards in the industry. We also are an active participant 
leader and member of the Flight Safety Foundation, Commercial Aviation 
Safety Team (CAST), National Safety Council and International Society of Air 
Safety Investigators.HANDLING POTENTIALL Y DANGEROUS GOODS
Another important component of flight safety is the safe handling of dangerous 
goods. Delta’s Dangerous Goods Management Group manages and oversees 
handling of dangerous goods, as well as implementation of companywide 
dangerous goods policies.
Due to strict regulations by domestic and international authorities related to 
acceptance, handling and transportation of dangerous goods, our program is 
operated as part of our quality management system. The program is tasked with 
establishing hazardous materials and dangerous goods standards, evaluating 
operations against those standards, recommending appropriate improvements 
and promoting awareness and compliance.
Delta understands the risks associated with carrying regulated materials on-board 
and accepts and transports hazardous materials through our Cargo/Airport Customer 
Service division, as well as transporting company-required materials to TechOps 
facilities. Delta’s HazMat program is fully compliant with applicable regulations, 
as well as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) technical instructions. 
Further ensuring the safety of our employees and customers, all Delta employees 
who may be required to handle any type of hazardous materials are trained 
annually through an FAA-approved training program.
Due to the continued risks posed by potential lithium ion battery fires from 
personal electronic devices (PED), we continue to focus on addressing this safety 
issue with thermal runaway bags on all flights. While the initiative itself was 
completed in 2017 a focus on PEDs allows Delta to address hundreds of batteries 
on any given flight. 
We continue to work with our Sky Team alliance partners to better communicate 
our prohibited items policies to customers. Our aim is to reduce confusion for 
customers across the alliance, making the process for handling dangerous goods 
more effective and efficient. 
SAFETY ACROSS OUR NETWORK
Delta is committed to safety collaboration with airline partners beyond 
what regulations require. This oversight includes codeshare partners and 
members of our Sky Team alliance. The FAA requires audits of each of our

This includes calls to our Customer Engagement Centers and customer inquiries through social media. Delta Air 
Lines Elite Contact Center was recognized in 2018 by J.D. Power for providing “An Outstanding Customer Service 
Experience” for phone support . Delta continues to enhance the travel experience through innovation, streamlined 
security procedures and an unrelenting focus on safety. We also continue to invest in customer-facing employees, 
providing training to more than 9,000 of them during 2018 to further enhance customer interactions.
We recognize that we are only as good as our ability to get customers to their destinations reliably and on time. 
For this reason, we consider completions, or flights that arrive without cancellation, and on-time arrivals 
among the key measures of customer satisfaction performance. We set monthly and annual 
goals for these metrics for both Delta and Delta Connection partners, and award 
bonuses to our employees for meeting or exceeding these goals. CUSTOMER

increase from 2017In 2018, we achieved a record 251 days without canceling any mainline flights, including 143 days with no system cancellations on the entire Delta platform—a 58.9 percent 
increase from our record achieved in 2017. In addition, 85.7 percent of our flights were on time across the network. Recognizing Delta’s strong performance, FlightGlobal 
awarded Delta “Most On-time North American Mainline,” “Most On-time North American Network Airline,” and “Most On-time International Mainline Airline.”
In 2018, the Delta Connection group, which is our five-carrier regional network, achieved 164 days of zero flight cancellations. The group achieved this level of performance 
through an intense focus on delivering reliable customer experience. When an individual Delta Connection carrier is unable to complete a flight due to a mechanical or other 
issue, often another carrier will step in and substitute that flight to ensure customers get to their destination with little or no disruption. 
Last year, Endeavor Air, Delta’s wholly owned regional subsidiary, jumped in to substitute 197 flights operated by 
another regional carrier that would have otherwise been canceled. Combined, the Delta Connection operation 
posted a 98.4 percent completion factor and nearly 72 percent on-time departures for the first six months of the 
year. In addition, 81.3 percent of Delta Connection flights were on time across the network for the year.
Delta takes the pulse of our customers using Net Promoter Scores, a standard tool for measuring customer 
satisfaction. Recognizing that customer satisfaction is driven by all aspects of the flight experience, from a smooth 
boarding process and technology upgrades to interactions with Delta employees, we are making investments 
in each of these areas. Training for Delta people now includes a focus on how interactions with customers can 
directly affect Net Promoter Scores and, in turn, customer loyalty and company revenue. 
During 2018, we sustained our strong record of customer satisfaction levels, with higher Net Promoter Scores in 
every region and a four-point improvement overall . We will continue to build on this success with investments in 
our products and people, as well as more than $12 billion in airport facility projects planned over the next decade. 
Our performance on our customers’ behalf in 2018 also included $2 billion of investment in partnerships with 
global airlines in order to give our customers even more choice.DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTCUSTOMER

CIRCUMSTANCES
Our investments and operating discipline are especially important when we are faced with events that are beyond our control, such as extreme 
weather events or security incidents. 2018 saw an active storm season, with Delta weathering storms across Hawaii, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Japan 
and the Korean peninsula, all of which resulted in disruptions to regular operations. Through it all, Delta people provided our customers the 
very best service in the industry, and customer satisfaction during such events has improved 5.5 points year over year, based on data collected 
on every flight.
Recovery from major events like these is crucial to maintaining customer trust. We have reinforced our readiness for these unforeseen 
challenges through our Irregular Operations Steering Committee, consisting of senior leaders from each operational division. This group has 
developed a cross-divisional manual of agreed-upon actions to aid in recovery from a disruption.
Additional keys to keeping satisfaction high during extraordinary circumstances have been advance planning, proactive communication and 
support in airports for impacted customers. For example, when severe weather or other events disrupt operations, Delta may issue a travel 
waiver to give customers the chance to take alternate flights without paying a change fee. T o make it easier for customers to know when a 
waiver is available, Delta now notifies customers via email or text when they are traveling from, through or to a market with a waiver. A pilot 
test of the tool drove a significant increase in customer satisfaction scores.40

SATISFACTIONDelta is in a unique position to support customers and communities 
in a world in which severe weather and natural disasters seemingly 
increase with every year. Over the years, we have honed our 
preparations and response processes for communities affected 
by hurricanes and other natural disasters. Our response before 
and after such events is comprehensive. 
First and foremost, to aid evacuations, Delta’s revenue 
management team has formalized a process to cap fares to and 
from impacted areas so that people trying to evacuate have a 
cost-effective way to leave and return home safely. Delta also 
identifies the need for additional aircraft and crew in impacted 
areas and deploys extra flights to add seat and cargo capacity. 
An extra flight, for example, was added from Honolulu to Los 
Angeles in August 2018 ahead of Hurricane Lane. As was the case 
last year, Delta also operates humanitarian flights, sometimes at 
the request of government officials, to move Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, Red Cross and other aid workers into 
communities to help them recover following a storm. 
Delta Cargo further supports humanitarian efforts by shipping 
relief supplies free of charge. This year we formalized the 
Employee Relief Shipment Program, developed in the midst of 2017 Hurricane Maria’s aftermath. Through the program, Delta 
employees donated 200,000 pounds of supplies in addition 
to the 600,000 pounds of relief supplies that Delta carried 
following the summer and fall hurricanes. 
Over the last two years, Delta has continued to enhance its  
Peach Corps, a network of hundreds of employee-volunteers with 
varying levels of customer service experience, who are called upon 
to support when the operation is in need. Whether that’s during a 
significant weather event or the terminal move in LAX, for example, 
the Peach Corps is a key component of the airline’s broader 
significant irregular operations plan and can be activated quickly 
to assist with customer meet and greet, wayfinding, line control, 
customer comfort and other service recovery functions.
Remaining committed to supporting larger relief efforts, The 
Delta Air Lines Foundation contributes $1 million annually to 
the American Red Cross as an Annual Disaster Giving Program 
member to help the organization prepare for disaster recovery 
before an event occurs. In addition, in 2018, The Delta Air Lines 
Foundation contributed $500,000 to the American Red Cross to 
aid relief efforts in the Carolinas and surrounding areas as a result 
of Hurricane Florence.

41WELCOMING EVERYONE 
ONBOARD
Delta is proud to serve all customers and committed 
to providing the same high level of service to all. We 
have an uncompromising policy to never discriminate 
against any customer. This not only complies 
with legal requirements applicable in the varied 
jurisdictions to which we fly, but also aligns with our 
core values and mission to provide the best possible 
travel experience and customer service for all.
Delta maintains a Disability Program office in our Corporate Safety, Security 
and Compliance division. This team is responsible for providing input for Delta’s 
nondiscrimination policy with regard to reasonable accommodations for our 
customers with disabilities. The team also partners with service and operational 
organizations throughout the company to ensure that our people understand 
policies and procedures, as well as applicable government regulations. 
A key resource supporting these efforts is the work of our Advisory Board on 
Disability (ABD), a volunteer organization comprised of 13 customer-members 
representing a spectrum of persons with disabilities. These members represent 
academic, business and health care backgrounds and consult with Delta on issues 
of concern and help to craft policies and procedures aimed at removing barriers to 
travel. Current projects include service and support animal policies, reducing damage 
to wheelchairs and other assistive devices, and designs for Delta’s airport terminals 
of the future.
As part of our commitment to customers, we carry approximately 700 service and 
support animals daily, adding up to nearly 250,000 per year. Lack of regulation in 
health and training screening for service and support animals, however, has led 
some travelers to stretch the true intent of service animal policies, using fraudulent 
certification paperwork. When animals that have not undergone the rigorous training 
required of true service and support animals board our flights, they pose a risk to 
customers—and do a disservice to individuals who have real and documented 
needs. Our ABD has provided guidance on defining policies and procedures related 
to support and service animals that establish how we can best accommodate the 
legitimate needs of customers with disabilities, while preventing service and support 
animal incidents. In March 2018, a new policy went into effect with the following requirements:
Customers Traveling With Trained Service Animals 
• Check in via Delta.com, the Fly Delta mobile app, airport kiosks or with an  
 airport agent 
Customers Traveling With Emotional Support or Psychiatric Service Animals Must Provide  
• A signed Veterinary Health form and/or an immunization record 
• Emotional Support/Psychiatric Service Animal Request Form 
• Letter prepared and signed by licensed mental health professional 
• Signed Confirmation of Animal Training Form 
• Check in with airport agent 
The policy was updated in July to include introducing a limit of one emotional support 
animal per customer per flight and no longer accepting pit bull-type dogs as service or 
support animals. These updates were implemented in light of incidents in which several 
employees and a customer were bitten and injured.
Delta’s Service Animal Support Desk aims to simplify the travel experience for customers 
traveling with service and support animals. The desk verifies receipt of all required 
documentation and confirms the customer’s reservation to travel with an emotional 
support or psychiatric service animal before arrival at the airport. 42

TRANSFORMING TRAVEL 
THROUGH TECHNOLOGY
to real-time news, content and sporting events. In early 2019, we introduced 
a new wireless in-flight entertainment system on the A220 across all cabins. 
The wireless seatback entertainment system will allow for easier updates and 
repairs over the lifetime of the aircraft. This system will transfer content to the 
screen wirelessly, allowing for fewer wires and less weight on the aircraft. 
We continue to generate new ideas through investments such as The Hangar, 
a global innovation center that taps into top university talent; Engage, an 
Atlanta-based accelerator that supports technology startups and of which 
Delta is a founding supporter; and Innovative Flight Experience weekends 
for employees meant to generate solutions from within our business. All 
of these efforts are helping to deliver a digital transformation of Delta 
that makes the travel experience a smoother one for our customers. As technology transforms so many aspects 
of modern life, Delta is making investments 
in technology that are enhancing the 
customer experience in new ways.
For example, thanks to recent advancements in biometrics technology, 
facial and fingerprint scans are beginning to replace boarding passes 
and government-issued IDs. Biometric verification provides a higher 
level of accuracy, and thus a higher level of security, than paper 
boarding passes and frees up agents to better assist customers with 
needs, such as seat changes, prior to flight. The technology also gives 
customers less to keep track of as they move through the airport, 
allowing them to travel faster and more seamlessly than ever. 
Delta has been partnering with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(US CBP) and CLEAR for over three years on pilot programs to test 
biometric screening. In 2018, Delta, in partnership with US CBP , launched 
the first biometric terminal in Atlanta’s Maynard H Jackson International 
Terminal. This optional, end-to-end Delta biometrics experience enables 
all international passengers flying on Delta, Aeromexico, Air France-
KLM and Virgin Atlantic to use facial recognition technology to:
• Check in at self-service kiosks in the lobby
• Drop checked baggage at lobby counters 
• Serve as identification at the TSA checkpoint
• Board a flight at any gate in Terminal F
• Go through CBP processing for international travelers entering the U.S.
Based on initial testing, facial recognition not only saves up to nine minutes 
per flight, but also frees employees to have more meaningful interactions 
with customers throughout the journey.
Delta continues to make significant improvements to customers’ in-flight 
technology experience, further closing the gap of what customers can 
expect on the ground and in the air. Some of the most notable improvements 
include expanding our high-speed, gate-to-gate Wi-Fi to over 60 percent 
of mainline aircraft; implementing Wi-Fi connection enhancements; 
providing a streamlined and responsive Wi-Fi portal design; and introducing 
Gogo day pass transferability on Aeroméxico’s Gogo-equipped aircraft.
Delta is also expanding and enhancing its onboard entertainment options by 
equipping more planes with live TV, allowing customers to stay connected FIRST

PROTECTING OUR 
DIGITAL ASSETS
Technology is a common thread across all 
improvements to the customer experience. 
As such, information security is essential to 
Delta. To operate effectively in a large, diverse 
environment and compete successfully in 
the global economy, Delta commits to having 
information assets that are secure, accurate and 
accessible. We make the security and privacy of 
our customers’ personal information a top priority.
Like most businesses and organizations, our information and technology 
systems are subject to increasing threats of continually evolving risk. Delta 
defines information security as the protection of information assets and the 
management of risks to those assets. Delta’s management strongly supports a 
robust and active information security program for its business worldwide. The 
Information Security and Privacy program ensures the confidentiality, integrity 
and availability of the information necessary to achieve long-term business 
success. It also maintains the privacy of all Delta employees and customers. 
To carry out our mission, Delta focuses on five layers of protection: identify, 
protect, detect, respond and recover. All Delta employees are expected to play 
their part in maintaining general information security and privacy as they handle 
corporate and customer information in their job functions. In 2018 we continued to improve our information security and privacy to improve 
reliability and enhance capabilities. In 2017 Delta Information Technology opened a 
disaster recovery data center, following the August 8, 2016, outage that hit the 
airline’s operations, employees and customers. What would normally take two years 
to implement took just 11 months for Delta IT, upholding Delta’s promise to have a 
backup data center in place to streamline disaster recovery efforts. While the data 
center has been operational since 2017, this enhancement allows for Delta IT to 
recover operations and allows the center to play an ongoing role in providing more 
resilient business operations. 
We also reduced the risk of technology system failures to our operations through 
additional disaster recovery processes and heightened emphasis on our Information 
Security and Privacy program.
Delta’s information security efforts that support our global operations include: 
•  Cyber Monitoring and Assurance whose mission is to protect Delta Air  
Lines through technical expertise in the Cyber Monitoring and Assurance  
arena, strengthening Delta’s front line of defense against a rapidly shifting  
threat environment.
•  Enterprise Identity Services is a multi-phased, multi-year implementation that 
aims to establish core Identity and Access Management services for employees, 
contractors and business partners through new capabilities, maturation of 
existing solutions and sunsetting legacy systems.
•  Information Risk and Compliance programs establish policies and standards, 
conduct assessments and promote security-related training and awareness 
programs, as well as ensuring compliance with legislation and regulatory 
requirements.DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  | 2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTCUSTOMER

SATISFACTIONDelta also seeks the opinions of industry experts to ensure that our Information 
Security program remains effective. In 2018, a third-party assessment found Delta’s 
ability to defend against security threats to be above the industry standard. 
Delta employees are the first line of defense against information security threats, 
and a workforce that is trained and aware of information security policies and 
processes helps to reduce the security risk to Delta’s information assets. Training 
regarding data protection-related privacy policies and processes is available 
for all personnel. All employees with access to Delta systems must complete 
information security awareness training upon hire and on an annual basis. 
We have extended our mandatory Information Security Awareness Training 
for new hires to include 78 percent more employees and contractors than in 
previous years.
Our Information Security Awareness program includes an expert speaker 
series, and awareness and engagement events in conjunction with large 
corporate events such as Relay for Life and LEAD, our twice-yearly leadership 
meeting. The team also participates in National Cybersecurity Awareness 
Month in October and Data Privacy Day in January. Awareness campaigns 
throughout the year focus on hot topics such as phishing, antitampering, 
data classification, password protection and ensuring a secure workspace. 
Training and awareness activities serve to not only educate employees about 
how to protect Delta’s information assets, but also to give employees and 
their families the tools they need to protect themselves in the digital world. 
Delta’s membership in information security-related organizations allows Delta  
to remain engaged with the broader aviation community, sharing best practices

47While air travel accounts for only about 2 percent of total global carbon 
emissions, we recognize the contribution of emissions to climate 
change and our role in helping to mitigate the carbon footprint of air 
travel. As a leading sustainability-focused airline, we are committed to 
working with partners across our industry to find meaningful business 
solutions that decrease our impact. 
The greatest contributor to Delta’s environmental footprint—and 
therefore our biggest opportunity—is our use of jet fuel. With the goal 
of making progress on reduction, we approach climate efforts in a variety 
of ways, including: 
• Committing to meet international targets for emissions reduction; 
• Replacing older aircraft with more fuel-efficient aircraft;
• Continuing to make improvements to existing aircraft; 
• Purchasing carbon offsets annually to mitigate the emissions from  
 flights; and 
•  Continuing to seek impactful and innovative energy efficiency 
projects in the facilities we own or operate. 
As global climate change issues continue to influence the airline 
industry, Delta is firmly committed to our industry-aligned, three-part 
approach to climate change that includes short-term, medium-term 
and long-term climate goals. The opportunity to address climate 
change risks has driven us to proactively track metrics and model future 
impacts related to both physical and regulatory risk. Physical risks 
include passenger safety issues due to increased turbulence events and 
more irregular operation days due to weather events. Regulatory risks 
include meeting the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU 
ETS) requirements, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation 
(CORSIA), and other potential environmental and emissions-reduction 
schemes. To help address these climate-related risks, Delta has integrated 
expected carbon costs into fleet planning and purchasing strategies, as well 
as fuel-efficiency approaches. Due to the scope of Delta’s emerging risks, including environmental 
sustainability and climate change, our strategic approach to addressing 
risk is part of a company-wide risk management process. This process 
works at both the divisional and board level through various Board of 
Directors committees. Ultimate oversight of environmental sustainability 
and climate change programs falls to the Board of Directors’ Corporate 
Governance Committee. In addition, a cross-divisional council—the Delta 
Risk, Privacy and Compliance Council—develops risk mitigation strategies 
and updates its assessment of risks as operational conditions change. 
While corporate oversight falls to the Governance Committee of 
the Board of Directors, day-to-day management of climate change 
and environmental sustainability issues is the responsibility of 
the Managing Director of Global Environment, Sustainability and 
Compliance, who reports to the Senior Vice President of Corporate 
Safety, Security and Compliance (CSSC). The Senior Vice President 
of CSSC is responsible for setting the direction and standards for 
environmental performance at Delta and chairs the Executive 
Environment Leadership Council (EELC). The EELC, a senior-level 
executive council responsible for the approval of our environmental 
sustainability and emissions strategies, programs and annual goals, 
also provides advice and recommendations to the CEO and Corporate 
Leadership Team on issues related to environmental sustainability, 
resilience planning and climate change issues and efforts. 
In 2018, the Board of Directors Governance Committee received climate 
and environmental briefings in April and October, while the EELC met in 
August to discuss ongoing strategic efforts.

Responding to New Regulations
Many parts of the world are introducing regulations to limit carbon 
emissions produced by various entities. For example, under the EU ETS, 
any flight originating from and landing in the European Union is currently 
subject to the ETS. If an airline exceeds its free emissions allowances under 
the ETS, it must purchase additional ones. Currently, Delta’s flights under 
the EU ETS obligation are typically intra-EU diversions and charters. 
As the regulatory landscape changes and evolves in the U.S. and abroad, we  
may face added regulations, taxes or permitting requirements related to our 
emissions, including requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same 
operations. As a result of ongoing discussions between the U.S. and other 
nations, the ICAO adopted CORSIA, a global, market-based emissions offset 
program, which begins a baseline period for monitoring, reporting and 
verification in 2019.Aligning With Industry Climate 
Change Goals
Delta has a Carbon Emissions Policy that supports achieving the 
industry’s short-, medium- and long-term emission reduction goals. The 
responsibility for review of our progress falls to our EELC. In addition, 
Delta leadership compensation is tied to performance, which includes 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) sustainability efforts that 
include operations, financial, customer service, employee and social 
responsibility goals. Because fuel accounts for a significant portion of 
Delta’s costs, any efforts to save fuel directly impact Delta’s bottom line, 
which in turn affects bonus pools and profit sharing for all employees.

The industry’s short-term goal is to improve fuel efficiency by an average of 1.5 percent 
annually from 2009 to 2020. The IATA goal is measured by gallons per revenue ton miles 
(RTM), or the amount of fuel needed to carry one revenue ton a distance of one mile.  
RTM is measured by multiplying the estimated weight of passengers plus actual cargo 
carried by the distance it was flown. This efficiency goal accommodates business growth.
In 2018, Delta’s fuel efficiency improved 1.23 percent compared to 2017, when a 2.21 percent 
year-over-year improvement was recorded. In 2018, our RTM grew by 3.24 percent, while 
total fuel use increased only 1.95 percent. Since 2009, Delta’s fuel efficiency has improved 
by 9.16 percent, an average of 1.02 percent annually. 
INNOVATIONS TO IMPROVE FUEL EFFICIENCY
We view Delta aircraft as long-term investments. While the body of a plane may stay in 
our fleet for up to 30 years, we are continually working to improve the efficiency of all 
aircraft both inside and out. Fuel-efficiency improvements must also be balanced with 
increasing demands on customer comfort and connectivity that often result in increased 
weight. Accordingly, we continuously seek innovative ways to increase the efficiency of 
our existing fleet. 
Ongoing efforts include upgrading winglets on some aircraft types and reducing onboard 
weight by avoiding over-fueling and over-provisioning. In 2018, In-Flight Service began 
rightsizing provisions to reduce operational weight, waste and costs on all flights. With 
thousands of global flights flown daily, this rightsizing effort reduced fuel burn by over 
330,000 gallons and fleet emissions by 3,200 metric tons.
Also in 2018, we reinvigorated a project to save fuel by cutting the running time of Delta’s 
onboard auxiliary power units (APUs), which provide additional energy to power onboard 
lighting, gallery appliances and cockpit avionics, usually while the aircraft is parked at the 
gate. With airport congestion increasing, Delta APU usage between arrival and departure 
doubled from 56 minutes in 2012 to 90 minutes in 2018, resulting in a cost of $3 million FUEL EFFICIENCYDelta Performance

a year for each minute of use across the fleet. A cross-divisional team 
engaged all frontline employees to implement a systemwide fuel 
savings initiative to reduce APU usage by 16 minutes for each aircraft’s 
turn. The project goal was to cut fuel usage by $50 million, which would 
also result in decreased fleet emissions. 
Cockpit technology also is helping to increase fuel efficiency. Initially 
introduced in 2016, the 2018 version of Delta’s flight deck weather app 
reduces the impact of turbulence, making flights more comfortable and 
fuel efficient through real-time information. While the proprietary app 
increases Delta’s fuel efficiency, a similar app currently deployed by a 
vast majority of competing global airlines is also helping to increase 
industry efficiency globally.
While innovative and proactive efficiency improvements like this 
help to offset many operational factors, some efficiency factors are 
beyond our control. For example, at busier airports, planes ultimately 
spend additional time taxiing and may even be required to circle in the 51

BUILDING A MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT FLEET
Our commitment to addressing climate change informs the way we manage our fleet. We focus 
strategically on ways to balance the promise of technological improvement in new aircraft with 
the desire to build a fleet with the longest and most sustainable aircraft life possible. In 2018, 
ongoing fleet modernization upgrades and replacements of aircraft, along with operational 
improvements and other measures, saved Delta an incremental 1.87 million gallons of fuel.
To improve short haul and regional efficiency, Delta has retired 280 50-seat regional jets and 
more than 130 older, narrow-body aircraft since 2009, while refreshing the fleet with over  
300 more fuel-efficient aircraft. In 2018, we replaced about 7 percent of narrowbody aircraft  
with quieter, more fuel-efficient models—about twice as many replacements as in a normal  
year. Over the next five years, Delta will continue upgrading our domestic fleet to replace 
less-efficient aircraft with highly efficient and state-of-the-art aircraft. We anticipate retiring 
approximately 40 narrowbody aircraft annually and replacing them with 50 more fuel-efficient 
narrowbody models. 
Building on our modernization efforts, in 2018 Delta became the first U.S. airline to take 
delivery of the Airbus 220—our newest state-of-the-art aircraft featuring best-in-class  
fuel efficiency.
As a result, Delta’s mainline fleet fuel efficiency improved 1.3 percent in 2018 over 2017 and 
finally dropped below the 14 gallon per 100 RTM barrier. Mainline fleet fuel-efficiency improved 
6.7 percent over its recent high in 2014. ENVIRONMENTAL

DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTCARBON NEUTRAL GROWTH THROUGH OFFSETS 
For our carbon offset portfolio, we ensure that these offsets 
not only have verified emissions reduction, but also advance 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in areas 
that Delta serves. 
For example, one of the offset projects we invest in is Peru’s Cordillera Azul National 
Park, which spans approximately 1.4 million hectares, more than 5,000 square 
miles, making it one of the largest protected areas in the country. Stretching across 
four regions, the park extends from mountainous cloud forests to lush Amazonian 
lowlands. While there are no formal human settlements within the park, Cordillera 
Azul lies at the center of a highly productive region with 520 rural villages and 
indigenous communities, all of which rely heavily on local natural resources for 
their livelihoods. Cacao, coffee and palm oil production drive economic activity 
and migration into the area, causing deforestation and forest degradation. 
Illegal logging, cattle ranching, ‘slash 
and burn’ agriculture, illicit agriculture 
and infrastructure development 
are also contributing to forest loss 
in the region. The Cordillera Azul 
project addresses the region’s 
causes of deforestation by funding 
conservation while supporting local 
communities in their transition to 
sustainable livelihoods. By properly 
valuing and paying for the carbon-
storing service the forests provide, 
carbon credits change the economic 
incentives by rewarding forest protection and providing education to local 
farmers to ensure a secure, commercially viable income stream through low-
carbon land use. The project will reduce global emissions by 22.1 million tonnes 
of CO2 by 2021—equivalent to taking 4.7 million cars off the road for a year.
Carbon credits generated by the Cordillera Azul Reducing Emissions 
from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) project are formally 
acknowledged by the Peruvian Ministry of Environment and are accounted 
for in the country’s national registry through a “nested” approach. Nesting 
this project within Peru’s REDD+ program means that the retired carbon 
credits, even internationally transacted ones, are not double-counted. 
Avoiding double-counting is essential to achieving a 1.5°C warming 
scenario and ensures the credibility of corporate climate action claims.
Medium-T erm Goal:  
Carbon Neutral Growth
ICAO’s CORSIA goal to cap international emissions at 2019/2020 levels 
will begin in 2021, but Delta has been purchasing offsets to maintain 
our total 2012 emissions since 2013. Since then, we have purchased and 
retired nearly 9 million carbon offsets, in addition to a commitment to 
retire more than 3 million offsets for our 2018 growth compared to 2012 
levels. These offsets will be purchased and retired in the first half of 2019. Emissions Offsets

Delta recognizes that fuel efficiency and carbon-neutral growth alone are not sufficient to address the risks of 
global climate change. In line with IATA’s long-term emissions-reduction goal, we have committed to reducing 
the absolute emissions that result from Delta’s mainline operation of more than 5,000 daily flights. 
To continuously track progress against our short-, medium- and long-term goal commitments, we have 
calculated and verified our full emissions inventory since 2005. Jet fuel from mainline (Scope 1) and regional 
aircraft (Scope 3) accounts for 98.9 percent of Delta’s total emissions. Currently, Scope 3 emissions only include 
jet fuel from our regional carrier partners. All emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3), including any offsets purchased and 
retired, are calculated in accordance with The Climate Registry’s reporting protocols. All verified emissions data 
dating back to 2005 are publicly available on The Climate Registry website at www.cris4.org . Since 2005, we 
have reduced our absolute emissions by 11 percent (Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 combined) through aircraft 
fuel efficiency efforts and efforts that go beyond our aircraft. Additional efforts beyond the aircraft include 
the use of more than 13.5 percent electric motors in our ground support equipment.

STEWARDSHIP54DEVELOPING SUSTAINABLE JET FUELS 
Because of the environmental and financial challenges posed by purchasing 
increasing amounts of jet fuel, many members of the aviation industry believe 
that the future lies with alternative, or nonpetroleum-based, sources of energy. 
As researchers explore the use of biofuels as alternative fuel sources, Delta has 
proactively developed a set of biofuel principles that will guide our decision-
making and investments in this area. To be worthy of investment, we believe 
that any new biofuel project must: 
• Meet applicable technical and regulatory standards, including ASTM D1655 
• Have lower environmental impacts (climate, water, air and biodiversity),  
 including lower life-cycle carbon emissions than conventional, petroleum-  
 based jet fuel 
•  Ideally, come from feed stocks that will not displace or compete with  
food crops 
• Satisfy technical and functional criteria that allow biofuel to be commingled  
 within existing national fuel transport, storage and logistics infrastructure, as  
 well as within individual airport and airline systems 
• Have no adverse impact on aircraft engines 
• Be reasonably cost-competitive with existing petroleum-based supply 
• Advance the future availability of jet biofuels 
• Meet Delta’s reputational and creditworthiness standards 
Delta engages with a range of producers and stakeholders to assess the technical, 
financial and regulatory challenges associated with bio-jet opportunities. A 
partnership with the University of Georgia, for example, helps to manage ongoing 
life-cycle analyses of biofuels. AL TERNATIVE FUEL  
COLLABORATION AT SEA-TACA BETTER CONNECTION
Delta is currently working with 12 other airlines to collaborate 
on a work plan to reduce emissions at Seattle-Tacoma 
International Airport, including exploring access to a low-
carbon and sustainably produced biofuel alternative to jet fuel. 
The work plan will explore the use of sustainable aviation fuels 
as well as a variety of other mechanisms that could contribute 
to carbon and air emission reductions, including technology, 
operations, infrastructure and future aircraft technology.

DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
As a responsible leader, we manage and measure environmental performance in the following areas: 
• Number and volume of spills 
• Number of Notices of Violation/Noncompliance 
• Number of core tasks completed on time in our Environmental Management Information  
 System (EMIS) 
• Compliance with air quality regulations 
• Compliance with hazardous waste and materials regulations
• Year-over-year performance for nonhazardous waste 
• Compliance with drinking water and wastewater regulations 
In 2018, Delta’s Board of Directors’ Corporate Governance Committee began overseeing all 
environmental- and climate-related risks and programs. All of our environmental impacts are 
governed by Delta’s Environmental Policy, which is approved by our Executive Environmental 
Leadership Council (EELC).
ENVIRONMENTAL COORDINATORS (EC s) 
As our daily hands-on compliance leads, ECs are located at all mainline airport stations and 
maintenance locations where Delta operates. They coordinate environmental compliance efforts, 
including conducting inspections, keeping records, liaising between airport environmental staff 
and regulatory authorities and overseeing airport service contractors. ECs also communicate with 
operating divisions and leadership at their respective airports. In addition, members of our corporate 
environmental compliance management team routinely work with ECs at airports to provide 
training and ensure that all compliance work is monitored and audited using the same metrics and 
protocols across the system. New airport customer service ECs are also required to attend in-person 
training sessions with an environmental compliance manager from their division and can enroll 
in additional and follow-up training to gain more hands-on experience. ECs who are required to 
use specialized equipment or have oversight in specific compliance areas such as stormwater, 
hazardous waste or drinking water receive additional standardized compliance training in their 
areas of responsibility. In 2018, we enhanced around 80 stormwater on-the-job training resources 
for ECs in our learning management system and plan to complete the remaining resources in 2019. Think of an airline, and you might 
picture airplanes and check-in 
counters. But Delta’s operations,  
and our environmental impact, go 
well beyond what most people  
see or realize. 
For example, our mechanics use chemicals and other 
materials in maintenance facilities to clean, upgrade, 
maintain and repair Delta aircraft and contract aircraft. 
Customers generate waste at Delta Sky Clubs and in flight. 
Ground crews handle millions of gallons of fuel daily. And 
safe drinking water must be on board every Delta flight. In 
each case, our actions have environmental impacts.
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a 
starting point for addressing nearly every action we take. 
We view regulations as our minimum requirement. Where 
we can, we go beyond compliance to make sure that our 
operations have the lowest possible environmental impact. 
And where regulations do not exist, we operate responsibly 
across our system by ensuring that we follow the best 
practices of the aviation industry. Building on best practices, 
we also seek to innovate based on our own operational 
knowledge and experience of what’s necessary for our 
people, customers and the environment. ENVIRONMENTAL

STEWARDSHIP
DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTSPILL DRILLS
Though we first seek to avoid all spills, in the event of a spill, Delta airport 
personnel are trained to follow regulatory compliant and internally approved 
protocols for environmental mitigation and corrective action. To learn what to 
do in the event of a spill, we provide both computer-based and hands-on 
training for spill response and cleanup. During a spill event, Delta personnel 
are trained to first ensure the safety of all employees, passengers and the 
public. Then, they should stop the spill at its source and contain it. After the 
spill has been contained, notifications should be sent to the appropriate 
internal divisions and, if required, to external regulators with information 
about the material and quantity of the spill, its location, how it occurred, 
containment status and clean up methodology. 
Once spills are contained, if necessary, a corrective action plan is developed 
and carried out to prevent future spills from occurring. 
SCHEDULED COMPLIANCE VISITS
These routine informal, nonregulatory visits provide additional and important 
opportunities for corporate environmental compliance managers to reinforce 
training while also providing additional guidance and feedback to station 
environmental personnel and divisional leaders. Responsibility for station 
visits falls to the corporate environmental compliance team that conducts 
visits to provide greater hands on oversight and opportunities to monitor and 
offer feedback at stations. This also allows us to conduct more comprehensive 
visits on an annual basis and more quickly identify areas for operational and 
process improvements, while also providing proactive opportunities for 
corrective action plans.

updated to ensure that it addresses all applicable local, state and federal 
environmental regulations. Key to our compliance activities, the EPM provides 
a consistent set of environmental guidelines and best practices for all of Delta’s 
U.S.-based operations. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (EMS)
Complementary to our EPM, the EMS is another internal management tool used to 
proactively manage and track station-specific environmental roles, responsibilities, 
records and documents. This system is also used to communicate and help airport 
stations individually understand station-specific requirements and provides stations 
with a proactive tool outlining all of their environmental requirements and methods 
for monitoring, documenting and complying with regulations. In 2018, we completed 
the review and installation of an EMS at all our mainline domestic stations, a 
process that took several years to accomplish. For a highly coordinated approach, 
we established common core task completion metrics across the network, using 
the airport customer service performance dashboard. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM 
(EMIS)
As a final part of compliance, Delta’s EMIS is a web-based tracking tool that 
works in conjunction with a station’s EMS to ensure timely compliance of 
scheduled environmental tasks. The system is designed to send automated 
notifications and task descriptions while also tracking completion of the 
notified tasks. In addition to task notification and completion, supplemental 
compliance information and data can be entered online, allowing it to be 
monitored by corporate, divisional and operational leaders. Delta started using 
a customized new online commercial software platform to boost compliance 
reporting and change management starting in the first quarter of 2019.ENVIRONMENTAL
STEWARDSHIP57
DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Our first step and ongoing goal is to prevent spills from occurring. However, in the event of a spill,  
Delta employees and business partners are trained to follow internally approved and externally  
compliant procedures for mitigation. 
When a spill happens, we manage it in an environmentally responsible manner—containing it, 
beginning cleanup and completing all required regulatory reporting and documentation. Then, involved 
personnel communicate the incident to station and division leadership. At that point, corporate 
environmental managers conduct a comprehensive analysis of the entire incident. Their goal is to 
gather any lessons to be learned from the experience, so we can prevent future spills from happening. 
To continually improve our progress on spills, we set goals for our operating divisions and track spill 
performance throughout the year. Other reportable environmental compliance areas include wastewater 
discharges, air emissions and solid waste, but can include any regulated material that may enter the 
environment. We investigate all Class I and II spills to determine causes and contributing factors.  
This helps us develop solutions that benefit all stations. 
In 2018, Delta experienced a decrease in the number of reportable spills overall. Our total number of recordable Class I and Class II spills was 86, a 
7.5 percent decrease from 2017. This number includes a total of 20 regulatory reportable spills, which is close to a 5 percent decrease from 2017. With 
the goal of continuous improvement, the annual variability of spill numbers is due to the growth in operational events and variations in the frequency of 
fueling, fleet type, de-icing events and other maintenance activities. Annual variability will continue to affect our reported spills on a year-over-year 
basis. While Delta takes precautions to prevent spills and especially spills to the environment, some perspective is required when reviewing Delta’s 
material handling spills relative to the total amount of that particular fluid handled during the year. For instance, Delta transfers roughly 2 million gallons of 
jet fuel daily in Atlanta alone, and when compared to the total amount of jet fuel spilled systemwide in 2018 (1,023 gallons), the fraction is very small.
NOTICES OF VIOLATIONS
Delta received four notices of violation (NOVs) from an environmental regulatory agency in 2018. One NOV was for failure to pay industrial wastewater permit fees 
on time; two were for exceeding permit conditions in stormwater discharges; and one was for exceeding the time limit for hazardous waste accumulation. No NOV 
resulted in a monetary penalty to the company.
Our environmental policies include procedures for preventing hazardous 
substances associated with our operations from entering the environment. 
These procedures explain how to store and handle all Delta-required 
substances and materials. This includes petroleum products like jet fuel, 
diesel fuel, gasoline and hydraulic fluid, as well as other substances such 
as glycol-based aircraft de-icing fluids.MANAGING &

on identifying and minimizing the occurrence of documentable compliance violations. Refocusing our efforts has also allowed us to establish best practices for the avoidance of reportable regulatory violations. TOTAL NUMBER AND VOLUME OF SIGNIFICANT SPILLS

PROTECTING 
AIR QUALITY
Delta is committed to reducing air emissions, 
including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen 
oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), sulfur 
oxides (SOx), volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).
To help improve air quality around airports, our stations and Technical 
Operations facilities comply with federal, state, city, county and district 
requirements. Third-party environmental professionals review and 
audit our air quality programs for compliance as necessary. These audits 
include a multifaceted inspection of agency reporting, emissions records 
and work practices. Delta tracks stationary and mobile equipment that 
contains ozone-depleting substances (ODS), chemicals that reduce 
stratospheric ozone. These substances are commonly found in aerosol 
products, foams and fire extinguishers. They are also used as refrigerants 
in air conditioning and cooling equipment. ODS Class I and II refrigerants 
are categorized based on their ozone-depleting potential. Because these 
units contain regulated substances, only certified technicians can perform 
maintenance that involves accessing the refrigerant-containing circuits. During 
required maintenance and servicing, we take all appropriate measures to 
prevent the release of ODS into the atmosphere. Where feasible, we buy 
or retrofit equipment that contains a substitute refrigerant with a lower global 
warming potential.
In addition, eight Delta facilities must file routine emissions inventory 
reports due to individual state requirements. This includes tracking five 
pollutants that may contribute to climate change: CO, NOx, PM, SOx and 
VOCs. Seven sites require regulatory reporting annually, and one requires 
reporting every three years. The eight facilities are:
• Atlanta Technical Operations Center, Atlanta, Georgia
• Atlanta Airport Station, Atlanta, Georgia
• Atlanta Corporate Headquarters, Atlanta, Georgia
• Minneapolis Airport Station and Technical Operations Center  
 (combined reporting), Minneapolis, Minnesota
• Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport Office Building J,  
 Minneapolis, Minnesota
• Iron Range/Hibbing Reservation Center, Hibbing, Minnesota
• Cincinnati Airport Station, Cincinnati, Ohio
• Salt Lake City Airport Station, Salt Lake City, Utah (triennial reporting)AIR QUALITY IN CALIFORNIA
Delta’s goal in California is to meet the air emissions requirements set by the state, 
which are more stringent than those imposed on our other domestic operations. In 
addition, we set our ground support equipment replacement and retrofit schedules  
in California to meet those required by regulation.
Our off-road diesel fleet in California proactively achieved the 2019 target of 4.1 grams 
of NOx per brake horsepower-hour, a standard measure for heavy-duty and nonroad 
engines. We achieved this target due to credits obtained by using electric off-road 
vehicles in place of diesel vehicles or adding newer diesel vehicles with verified 
emission controls in place.
We also surpassed the large spark ignition engine targets for forklift and nonforklift 
subsets. For the forklift group, we exceeded the mandate for hydrocarbon (HC) and 
NOx emissions of 1.1 grams per brake horsepower-hour (g/bhp-hr) with our fleet 
average of 1.0 g/bhp-hr. For the nonforklift group, we exceeded the mandate for HC 
and NOx emissions (2.5 g/bhp-hr) with our fleet average of 2.1 g/bhp-hr.
Having met the 2017 compliance targets for the diesel airborne toxic control measures, 
Delta now qualifies for certain advantages in the new rule promulgated in 2018. To 
qualify we achieved the previous particulate matter standard of 0.18 g/bhp-hr for 
portable nondrive diesel engines under 175 horsepower and 0.08 g/bhp-hr for similar 
engines between 175–750 horsepower. Under the revised rule the combined fleet target  
is 0.1 g/bhp-hr. We see no issue with achieving this standard by the 2020 target.

STEWARDSHIP60AIRCRAFT 
DRINKING WATER
The quality of aircraft drinking water is a 
top priority to ensure customer safety and 
satisfaction. Each Delta plane is equipped  
with a tank system that holds anywhere from 
38 to 290 gallons of water, depending on 
fleet size and type. This water is needed for 
hot tea and coffee made in the galleys, while 
regular drinking water is served from bottles. 
The onboard water system also supports 
sinks and commodes in the lavatories.
Delta sources local water from municipal water sources that have been  
approved by the EPA as public water systems. Public water systems are held 
to the EPA’s National Primary Drinking Water Standards. As required by EPA’s 
Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, Delta disinfects each of its more than 850 aircraft 
four times per year, performs water quality sampling once per year, and reports 
this information to EPA on an ongoing basis. Delta cabin maintenance mechanics 
are responsible for performing disinfections and taking water samples.
Potable water on flights from international locations must meet EPA requirements 
that water be absent of total coliform bacteria, an indicator of potential water 
contamination. If coliform is detected in any water sample, Delta performs prescribed 
corrective measures at the earliest possible opportunity for each aircraft. These 
measures include further disinfection of the water tank and follow-up sampling.CHANGING THE COURSE  
OF WATER CONSERVATIONA BETTER CONNECTION
Delta continues to take steps to better understand the scope 
of our global water footprint. This is a complex undertaking, 
given that we do not own, operate or manage the majority of 
the locations in which we operate, and therefore are not billed 
directly for water. In the absence of a full picture of our water use, 
we seek incremental efforts to positively impact water quality 
and promote restoration in the communities we serve. 
One such effort is a partnership with Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta 
International Airport to support Bonneville Environmental 
Foundation’s Change the Course, a freshwater conservation and 
restoration initiative. Customers and employees can replenish 
waterways across North America by texting the word “Delta” 
to 474747, or by refilling a reusable water bottle at water filling 
stations on Delta concourses and throughout the Atlanta airport. 
Change the Course restores 1,000 gallons of water for every text 
received and matches every bottle of water refilled. In the first 
two years of the program, more than 16.5 million gallons of water 
were restored—enough to fill 25 Olympic-size swimming pools. 
In 2019, Delta is expanding the program to Detroit Metropolitan 
Wayne County Airport as well as to Delta Sky Clubs. 
Delta and the Atlanta airport’s support of Change the Course 
benefits the Flint River Water Stewardship project, which 
provides funding, outreach and technical support to modernize 
irrigation systems, maximize crop production, reduce water use 
and restore flows in important areas throughout the lower Flint 
River Basin. The river runs 344 miles across the state, including 
underneath Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTWASTE MANAGEMENT
Reducing the waste we generate is important 
both for meeting our environmental compliance 
commitments and lowering our overall 
environmental impact. We continually assess 
our waste streams and waste handling 
operations to identify high-value materials 
for reuse and recycling, as well as ways to 
minimize what we send to landfills.  
We have identified three main waste streams 
varying by material type and regulatory 
handling requirements: hazardous waste, 
nonhazardous waste and recyclable or 
reusable materials.
HAZARDOUS WASTE
Hazardous wastes are a byproduct of operating a safe and compliant 
commercial airline. We recognize the negative societal and environmental 
impacts of improper handling and disposal of hazardous waste—including 
harm to the health of our employees and local communities. Accordingly, 
Delta has initiatives in place to ensure proper disposal and to meet all 
applicable regulatory handling and disposal requirements. This includes EPA Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest requirements, which will ensure 
tracking of hazardous waste. Delta’s hazardous waste is carefully managed 
by vetted and approved handlers to ensure that both Delta and the public 
remain protected and safe. 
Delta has waste minimization plans at all large-quantity generator locations 
and is working to reduce hazardous waste generation. We aim to reduce 
our hazardous waste generation year over year and set goals accordingly, 
monitoring our progress monthly. In 2018, we generated 444 tons of hazardous 
waste, achieving our 2018 goal of less than 477 tons of hazardous waste from 
Delta operations. We generated an additional 187 tons of hazardous waste 
soils, in addition to the waste made by our normal operations. These soils were 
removed during an airport redevelopment project. Although Delta did not 
contaminate these soils, we are responsible for ensuring that when the soils are 
removed for a redevelopment project, they are handled in full compliance with 
applicable federal, state and local environmental regulations. Removing and 
disposing of these soils in a safe, proper and compliant manner reduces the 
overall impact on the environment and demonstrates Delta’s commitment to 
environmental stewardship. 
Delta was able to meet the goal of reducing our operationally generated 
hazardous waste through various means and methods. Some of this 
reduction is attributed to the replacement of older aircraft and some due 
to normal maintenance cycles that operate on a cyclical basis. Delta is 
continuing to work with our chemical providers and OEM manufacturers 
to try to understand and reduce our waste footprint and lower our overall 
chemical intensity. 
Establishing this goal increases transparency and compels us to 
continuously identify ways to reduce our environmental impact. 
ENVIRONMENTAL
STEWARDSHIP62NONHAZARDOUS WASTE
Operating a major airline includes not only management of our own waste, 
but also customer-generated waste materials. Delta-generated waste includes 
waste from operations, maintenance and construction activities at airports 
and other locations where partners can separate our materials and send us 
waste stream volumes. Understanding and handling this complex mix of waste 
streams means that not all nonhazardous waste generated can be recycled or 
diverted from a landfill. Working toward the highest possible diversion rate, 
we seek to identify both materials and opportunities to increase our landfill 
diversion efforts. Much like our approach to hazardous waste, in 2018 we 
targeted year-over-year improvements for reducing the nonhazardous waste 
volume generated in our operations. In 2018, we produced 1,015 total tons 
of nonhazardous waste from Delta operatons alone, which includes reusable 
and recyclable materials. This number is down from 1,135 tons in 2017. Delta 
did undertake a large number of redevelopment and construction projects in 
2018, which resulted in a significant amount of nonhazardous waste.* Delta also 
built the world’s largest engine test cell at our maintenance base in Atlanta, 
Georgia. These redevelopment projects alone resulted in a significant amount 
of nonhazardous material being placed into landfills in 2018. Delta, in removing 
this material from the areas that were developed, not only met our regulatory 
obligations but also helped to lower the overall impact of Delta’s operation 
(and the grounds upon which they sit). DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

This effort comes on the heels of removing plastic wrap from international main 
cabin cutlery and is expected to eliminate nearly 300,000 pounds in plastic 
waste annually—the weight equivalent of around 2 Boeing 757 aircraft. We 
have also eliminated unnecessary plastic wrapping from Delta One amenity 
kits and continue to review all of the plastics used in our onboard service. We 
have achieved zero-waste operations—which we define as 90 percent waste 
diverted from landfill—at multiple Delta Sky Club locations, including Seattle, 
Minneapolis-St Paul and San Francisco. These Delta Sky Clubs recycle packaging, 
compost leftover food and provide eco-conscious food service items.ENVIRONMENTAL

REUSABLE MATERIAL
Delta has embraced the concept of “upcycling,” or giving materials a second life as 
new product or product inputs. These innovative diversion programs, launched with 
a variety of partners and vendors, reduce the amount of new materials needed to 
produce new products in the marketplace. 
RECYCLABLE MATERIAL
A major way we’re reducing our environmental impact is by identifying and 
diverting valuable recyclable materials from our waste streams. We’re doing 
this both through recycling goods on flights where we maintain control of the 
materials at the station level, and by encouraging our employees to recycle  
at home and at work using our Atlanta-based Employee Recycling Center. In  
both efforts, we donate all rebate funds to Delta community and employee 
support programs. 
Delta’s in-flight commingled recycling program, in operation since 2007, 
is a great example of our commitment to reducing waste in the air and on 
the ground. While the program is not available on every Delta flight, due to 
destination airport service availability and operational constraints, we do offer 
onboard recycling options into 41 destination cities. We collect single-stream 
materials, including plastic, aluminum and paper, during flights and bag them  
for diversion. Upon flight arrival, the materials are collected by the cabin  
service team or catering team and picked up by recycling haulers.
There are 38 domestic recycling locations and three international recycling 
locations across the Delta system. We do not always receive rebates or volumes 
for these materials due to airport-specific protocols for removing waste, but we 
are nevertheless committed to removing these items from the waste stream. 
Thanks to our increased aluminum can recycling volume, the program set a 
record for collection and revenue in 2017 and had its second-best year in 2018. 
Over this two-year span, the program brought in more than $440,000. We 
continue to donate rebates earned from Delta’s in-flight recycling program to 
Habitat for Humanity through Delta’s Force for Global Good. From the proceeds  
raised in 2018, Delta will be able to continue building Habitat homes in the 
communities we serve. Total rebates from 2007 to 2018 have totaled more than 
$1.3 million dollars. These funds have been used, along with Delta employee 
volunteer hours, to fund and build 12 Habitat for Humanity homes in five Delta 
cities through 2017 and will be put toward more homes in coming years. 
It is worth noting, however, that at the end of 2018, Delta noticed a significant 
drop in recycling revenue. This loss of revenue is attributed to a significant drop 
in the price for recycling commodities on the open markets, primarily brought about by the lack of demand for our recycled commodity products. Delta is 
working to minimize the impact on the existing revenue stream from recycling. 
However, if current trends continue, it is likely that continuing rebates will be less 
than in previous years. 
IN-FLIGHT RECYCLING CHALLENGES
Materials handling and infrastructure issues pose a challenge for capturing and 
reporting progress on in-flight recycling efforts. At most domestic locations, we 
encounter challenges in measuring diversion rates and understanding trends for 
recycling efforts once materials leave our aircraft. Our waste streams may become 
intertwined with other carriers’ waste, or airport authorities may choose not to 
share this information. This difficulty, combined with more airports developing 
their own recycling programs, means that we foresee continued challenges in 
capturing, tracking and monitoring total volumes for our recycling efforts. We 
have also seen recycling markets start to collapse as the demand for recycled 
items drops significantly. 
SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES 
FROM THE SHOP FLOOR UPA BETTER CONNECTION
Delta’s Technical Operations group (TechOps) does a lot for 
the airline, maintaining the Delta fleet in accordance with all 
requirements and standards, as well as performing maintenance 
for other airlines and organizations. The group supports on-time 
performance through the operation of line maintenance stations 
that work at various stations on aircraft, both on an as-needed 
basis during the day, as well as overnight when aircraft need to 
have engine oil changed or other required maintenance to make 
sure they are ready to fly on time the next morning.
Chemicals used at our TechOps maintenance operations have 
stringent “use by” dates. When unused product has passed this 
date, it is sometimes classified as hazardous waste if it cannot 
be used in another application. This results in wasted product 
and the added expense required to treat and dispose of the now 
hazardous waste. Tony Rodriquez, who runs the Fort Lauderdale 
International Airport line maintenance station, worked with 
his team to calculate the correct amount of chemicals to be 
allocated to the station to avoid generating waste and still 
meet the station’s repair obligations. This effort resulted in 
reducing the team’s hazardous waste by almost half, and Tony 
is now working with a cross-functional group to duplicate this 
success where possible and practical within the TechOps Line 
Maintenance Organization.
ENVIRONMENTAL
STEWARDSHIPKITCHEN RECYCLING GAINS TRACTIONA BETTER CONNECTION
International flight regulations also pose challenges to increasing in-flight recycling. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture considers materials from international flights 
contaminated with meat, dairy and/or produce to be regulated waste, which must be 
thermally treated to ensure there is no contamination to domestic U.S. agriculture. 
Similar rules exist in every country to which we fly. For this reason, Delta’s greatest 
challenge remains how best to collect and separate materials to keep recyclable 
materials uncontaminated both onboard the aircraft and upon arrival at the 
international flight kitchen.
RECYCLING AT DEL TA HEADQUARTERS
In support of the largest concentration of Delta employees and Delta office space 
domestically, the employee recycling center (ERC) in Atlanta provides a place for 
all employees to recycle materials generated at home and process recyclables 
from our Atlanta headquarters. 
Employees can bring materials that include aluminum cans, plastic bottles,  
tin and paper. We also have an employee recycling program at the Atlanta 
Technical Operations Center. The ERC donates all rebate funds to the  
DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Delta Employee & Retiree Care Fund to help individuals who suffer from severe 
financial hardship resulting from unforeseen and unavoidable crises such as 
natural disasters. 
In late 2018, Delta launched composting as an option for waste diversion at the 
cafeterias in our corporate headquarters, Technical Operations Center, Atlanta 
Customer Engagement Center, and Atlanta Training Center by replacing most 
of our food service items with compostable containers. Composting allows us 
to divert food waste from the landfill, avoid methane emissions and generate 
valuable nutrient-dense compost. Delta feels this is a game changer for our 
hometown environmental footprint, in a state where composting only recently 
became available. In coming years we look forward to measuring the benefits  
of this project. 
Delta also launched a new office recycling trial in a few locations at our corporate 
headquarters using “Recycle Across America” standardized labels. The trial aimed 
to streamline recycling containers and labels and was implemented in conjunction 
with a focused training campaign. The trial achieved significant improvement in 
the volume of recyclables, as well as in the quality of recyclable material.

 2018contributed to significant year-over-year revenue and volume 
gains in aluminum can recycling. Delta doesn’t stop at aluminum 
cans, however. At our Minneapolis flight kitchen, plastic film 
wrap and plastic bottles were eliminated, and composting was 
introduced, all in an effort to reduce our environmental impact. 
64Flight kitchens throughout Delta’s network are busy places  
where chefs prepare amazing culinary delights for our passengers as 
sustainably as possible. In all Delta domestic owned/leased kitchen 
operations, we recycle aluminum cans, which results in a high-quality 
aluminum stream to produce recycling revenues. This practice 
currently generates much of the revenue in Delta recycling programs. 
In 2017 and 2018, we have focused heavily on operations in Atlanta, 
where we installed a can compactor to try to match recycling 
successes in Minneapolis and Detroit. The can compactor improved 
sorting, and a new used beverage container recycling partner ENVIRONMENTAL

newest recreational public green space, Cook Park is set to open 
in 2019 and is a joint venture between the City of Atlanta, the 
Westside Future Fund, The Trust for Public Land and the National 
Monuments Foundation. The Delta Air Lines Foundation contributed 
$1 million toward the park’s creation with $500,000 allocated to the

install monuments honoring historic Atlanta leaders.The Westside of Atlanta is known for its rich black history narrative, 
once home to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and other civil rights 
movement luminaries, along with the world’s largest consortium of 
historically black colleges and universities. In 2018, Delta and The 
Delta Air Lines Foundation made a $25 million commitment to 
invest in the transformation of this area to the Westside Future 
Fund, an organization established by the Atlanta Committee for 
Progress, to address areas of need, including safety and security, 
cradle-to-career education, health and wellness and mixed-income 
communities. Delta’s support of the Westside is multifaceted and

It is our responsibility to help guide 
tomorrow’s global leaders. Delta’s 
education efforts aim to inspire the 
next generation of Delta employees, 
customers and shareholders, 
positioning them for bright futures in 
aviation and the general workforce.In line with this commitment, we invest in organizations that engage students in science,  
technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs and underscore the importance of financial  
literacy, economics and entrepreneurship. 
•  Delta supports 31 Junior Achievement (JA) chapters across four continents, igniting students’ 
interest in aviation careers through job shadows and outreach programs that teach financial 
literacy, entrepreneurship, macroeconomics, business and career readiness. 
•  Delta serves as a National Signature Partner of 3DE, a JA program for high school students, and 
committed $2 million upon its creation. The program focuses on developing public-private 
partnerships to systemically re-engineer education to better reflect the real world and prepare 
students for life beyond the classroom.

BUILDING A PIPELINE OF FUTURE LEADERSA BETTER CONNECTION
Across four continents and 31 chapters, Delta’s support of Junior Achievement deepened in 
2018 with a shared mission: to spark students’ interest in aviation careers through financial 
literacy, work readiness and entrepreneurship education. 
Through JA job shadows and outreach programs, Delta has inspired more than 800,000 
students each year since 2013—the next generation of Delta employees and customers. 
In Atlanta, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York and Salt Lake City, students work 
alongside Delta employees, shadowing leaders on the job at key Delta hubs for a behind-the-
scenes look at airport operations. Students also learn financial literacy and budgeting skills 
through interactive Delta storefronts at JA Finance Park and BizTown facilities. 
Delta supports JA’s U.K. chapter, Young Enterprise, through job shadows at Heathrow Airport 
and sponsorship of Young Enterprise’s annual Company Programme Trade Fair and the 
National Finals, and JA Americas through various event support. And since 2015, Delta has 
supported the JA Company of the Year competition, which expanded to JA Africa and JA 
Europe in 2018, presenting the Delta Social Impact Award to students across the globe who 
have shown entrepreneurial thinking to develop an innovative solution to a social challenge. 
In addition, in 2018, Delta CEO Ed Bastian announced a surprise $2 million commitment over 
five years toward 3DE, the new national extension of JA Academy, which launched in Atlanta 
in 2015. Delta was the first corporate national sponsor of the revamped program, which 
re-engineers high school curriculum to be more relevant and connected to the experiences 
that exist beyond the classroom. Its school-within-a-school model has proven to significantly 
elevate students’ social, academic and career readiness outcomes.
In addition, Delta supports early education 
programs, recognizing that learning can take on 
many forms. 
• Delta has contributed to 26 total KaBOOM!  
 playground builds across 13 markets since  
 2013—giving students and local kids safe  
 places to play. In 2018, our employees built  
 KaBOOM! playgrounds in Atlanta, Los Angeles,  
 Miami, New York, Salt Lake City and  
 Washington, D.C.
• Delta teamed up with The Trust for Public Land  
 to build a playground in historic Rodney Cook,  
 Sr. Park as part of the revitalization efforts of  
 Atlanta’s Westside community.
•  2018 marked our second year in partnership 
with Atlanta Public Schools, as part of our 
$500,000 contribution over five years to 
improve the quality of education and literacy 
rates at two elementary schools in the South 
Atlanta cluster, each located near Hartsfield-
Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The 
partnership includes ongoing reading and 
tutoring support with Delta employees and 
helps cover essential student needs like books, 
clothing and meals. 
• Delta partners with 22 YMCA chapters globally,  
 helping children, adults and families with  
 programs and services including afterschool  
 care, financial assistance, global education,  
 swimming, mentoring, early learning  
 readiness and more. HEAL TH AND WELLNESS
In an effort to create a healthier global community, Delta 
helps meet employees’ and customers’ basic needs through 
health and wellness initiatives. 
GIVING PEOPLE A PLACE TO CALL HOMEA BETTER CONNECTION
 In addition to the six homes in China, employees got to work in 
Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle, adding five more 
Habitat homes to the 2018 roster. Homes in Atlanta were funded by 
Delta’s Onboard Recycling Program, while the Seattle build was the 
third in a housing development for military veterans built by Delta 
employees who are also veterans.
72Each year, Delta employees work with Habitat for Humanity to 
provide safe and affordable housing for people across the globe. 
Since the partnership began in 1995, employees have helped build 
or rehab 264 homes both domestically and internationally. 
In 2018, Delta Air Lines completed its 15th Global Build with 
Habitat for Humanity in Sancun, a small village 85 miles north 
of Guangzhou, China. Here, 52 Delta employees and retirees, 
representing 18 stations and seven countries, along with 16 China 
Eastern employees and four SkyMiles customers, worked together 
to help with the construction of six new homes for local families.Delta’s commitment to action and outreach is exemplified through corporate 
support and employee engagement opportunities. Highlights from 2018 include: 
•  Throughout 2018, Delta employees constructed six homes in Guangzhou, 
China, in addition to homes in Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. 
Delta people have helped build or rehab 264 homes in 12 countries across the 
globe through our more than 20-year partnership with Habitat for Humanity. 
Each year, more than 2,500 employees volunteer their time to build safe and 
affordable homes.
•  In 2018, Delta supported 24 children’s hospital organizations in the U.S. and 
the U.K., 18 of which were Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, and served 
as the presenting sponsor of Children’s Hospital Week in Orlando. Other 
children’s hospital support included Great Ormond Street Hospital in the U.K. 
and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

meals. Employees volunteered at 21 food banks across the globe, 18 of which 
are Feeding America food banks.
Delta employees and customers raise millions of dollars for organizations 
actively working to promote wellness, combat disease and fight hunger.
• Since 2005, Delta employees and customers have raised an unprecedented  
 more than $16.7 million for Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF).   We celebrated the 14th anniversary of the “Breast Cancer One” survivor flight  
 in October—our keystone event that kicks off a month-long campaign to  
 generate awareness and raise money for BCRF. The Pink Plane carried  
 140 employee breast cancer survivors from Atlanta to Boston to celebrate  
 their victories, share inspiring stories of courage and raise funds for  
 breast cancer research.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT74
Delta employees, retirees and customers donated a record 11,085 pints of blood at  
Delta-hosted American Red Cross blood drives across the system for the 2018 fiscal year  
(YE 6/30), which equates to up to 33,000 lives saved. 
This donation record—an 18 percent increase from the previous donation year—moved 
Delta to the No. 1 spot for corporate blood donations in the U.S., marking the most 
successful year since the airline’s partnership with the humanitarian organization began in 
1941 during World War II. Delta was No. 11 on the corporate sponsor list just six years ago.
This fiscal year, Delta 
hosted 214 blood 
drives in 36 locations, 
including one of the 
largest Red Cross blood 
drives in the country 
hosted at Delta’s

ABOUT 
THIS REPORT
Delta’s 2018 Corporate Responsibility Report (CRR) is our second report 
aligned with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards framework. The 2018 
CRR utilizes our most recent (2017) biannual GRI Materiality Assessment 
priority topics. More information on our Materiality Assessment process and 
material topics can be found on pages 76-78. The 2018 CRR is a snapshot 
of our ESG efforts covering the period of January 1, 2018, to December 31, 
2018, and is an update to our previous report published in 2017. For all ESG 
information defined as material in our 2017 Materiality Assessment, ESG 
information and metrics are presented for the current year and for a minimum 
of three previous years. The report has been prepared in accordance with 
GRI Standards: Comprehensive application level. This report also provides 
additional information and data, not specified by GRI, that Delta and its 
stakeholders deem relevant to business operations. A complete GRI Standards 
Content Index can be found beginning on page 85. 
2018 CRR EXTERNAL ASSURANCE
We conduct assurance to verify our primary environmental impact—carbon 
emissions. An external assurance statement for emissions can be found on 
page 84.
Ruby Canyon Engineering, Inc. conducts our carbon emissions verification 
and provides a reasonable level of assurance on our Statement of Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) Emissions for reporting. Verified emissions data back to 2005 is 
publicly available on The Climate Registry website at www.cris4.org .
Note that Delta’s annual GRI reporting timeline and annual emissions 
verification and reporting timelines do not coincide. For this reason, annual 
verification of emissions data trails our CRR GRI report by one year. As a 
result, annual emissions for the 2018 CRR reporting year will be verified after 
the 2018 CRR has been published. Further, due to internal timeline reporting 
differences, any discrepancies from past CRR reporting to final verification will 
be noted in the external verification statement and in relevant tables.

Department 725
1020 Delta Blvd.
Atlanta, GA 30354MATERIALITY
Materiality is a key component of Delta’s annual corporate environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) reporting strategy because it allows us to 
strategically address and provide information on our most relevant ESG topics 
as defined by our six stakeholder groups: 
• Investors
• Customers
• Employees
• Suppliers
• Communities  
• Governments & Nongovernmental Organizations
At Delta, we use our annual Corporate Responsibility Report (CRR) to 
transparently communicate how we view, prioritize and approach the identified 
ESG sustainability topics. We conduct materiality assessments on a biannual 
basis. In 2017 we revisited our 2015 assessment, in line with reporting best 
practices, to both re-examine our ESG approach and to prepare us to transition 
to the GRI Standards framework. 
Our 2017 assessment initially evaluated and examined more than 68 different 
topics that were then narrowed to 10 priority reporting topic areas. These  
10 priority topic areas helped to further define the information which we  
report on in 2018.
MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT PROCESS
In an effort to continuously evaluate and determine which priority topics are 
key to operating a world class airline, we directly engaged our six stakeholder 
groups through a questionnaire process. This type of direct engagement allows 
us to both better understand the topics that are important to our stakeholders, 
as well as to provide exceptional service in an evolving business environment. 
While our stakeholder engagement activities prior to 2017 had historically 
focused on customer service, satisfaction and support, the 2015 and 2017 
materiality engagement processes allowed us to build on past efforts and 
further define our priority topics.  
APPENDIX77
DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTMETHODOLOGY
Drawing on GRI guidance we utilized a four-step approach. The process first sought to IDENTIFY possible topics, then PRIORITIZE topics, VALIDATE results and finally 
APPL Y & ALIGN the list to our CRR reporting strategy and to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs).

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Continuous engagement and regular dialogue with our six defined stakeholder groups, through both formal and informal processes, allows us to innovate and 
proactively address emerging ESG needs and risks. 
In addition to ongoing internal stakeholder engagement efforts and commitments, we regularly engage with external stakeholders on trending and emerging issues 
that matter to them. One way we do this is by responding to inquiries and requests for information related to our ESG sustainability practices. Identification
Following cross-industry and 
industry research, a coverage 
universe of 68 potential material 
topics was established. From 
this universal list, topics were 
then narrowed to 30 of the most 
relevant airline specific topics.1
Prioritization
Based on the narrowed list of 30 
topics, a survey was developed 
that asked stakeholders to rank the 
importance of each topic relative to 
the others. We disseminated two 
versions of survey—one to internal 
stakeholders and another to external 
stakeholders. Both internal and 
external survey results were then 
aggregated and analyzed to create an 
initial topic ranking and matrix. 2
Validation
Delta’s CRR reporting committee 
reviewed and discussed the matrix 
and prioritization of the 30 material 
issues. Based on this discussion, a 
final ranking and matrix were created. 3
Application & Alignment
The material topic list was mapped 
and applied to GRI comprehensive 
disclosures and aligned with the 
UNSDGs (see 2018 CRR page 14). 
Translating and prioritizing matrix 
results into reporting topics produced 
a list of the top 10 material topics for 
reporting. While the top 10 topics list 
receives the highest degree of coverage 
in our CRR, the final list of 30 topics 
also helped to inform the full extent of 
information found in the 2018 report. 4 
APPENDIX78
DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTIn addition to understanding that direct and indirect stakeholder engagements allow us to innovate and evolve our ESG efforts, we understand that increased 
transparency also helps us effectively improve our business over the long term. A list of external charters and associations Delta is actively engaged with includes:
• Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
• CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project)
• The Climate Registry
• Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI)• FTSE4Good

and collective bargaining. This includes the right to decide whether to be 
represented by a union. Our U.S.-based employees are covered by the Railway 
Labor Act (RLA), the federal law governing labor relations between air carriers 
and their employees. Under the RLA, employees have the right to decide 
whether they wish to be represented by a union. They also have the right to 
reject union representation. As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 80,000 
full-time equivalent employees, approximately 19 percent of whom were represented by unions. The following table shows our domestic airline employee 
groups that are represented by unions—numbers from the December 31, 2018

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE
Delta’s stakeholders expect us to produce sustainable and responsible positive 
financial results while investing in healthy communities, maintaining a robust 
workforce and protecting natural environments. Collectively, these expectations 
drive our approach to ESG sustainability and responsibility. For this reason, ESG 
sustainability at Delta is defined as meeting the company’s financial goals of 
growth and profitability over time through innovative business practices that 
minimize the environmental impact of Delta operations and promote the  
health, welfare and productivity of the individuals and communities we employ  
and serve.
The highest governance body for ESG oversight is the Delta Board of Directors 
Corporate Governance Committee, the charter of which was amended to include 
responsibility for the oversight of Delta’s sustainability efforts and progress. This 
committee received two sustainability briefings in 2018. 10-Q and investor relations website http://ir.delta.com. In this report, 
financial performance data focuses on economic performance as it relates to 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. The organizational entities 
covered in this CRR are the same as those presented in our Annual Report. 
APPENDIX80
DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTAt the operations level, ESG oversight is the responsibility of our Executive 
Environmental Leadership Council (EELC), which is made up of senior leaders 
who help establish and support environmental sustainability and corporate 
responsibility policy, strategy and action plans that address risks and opportunities.
Seeking continuous improvement, including self-evaluation and risk mitigation 
related to ESG, the EELC met in 2018 to further align and direct sustainability and 
climate change issues and initiatives that included:
• Industry engagement on climate change policy at the International Civil  
 Aviation Organization (ICAO)
• Performance against the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA)  
 1.5 percent fuel efficiency improvement goal 
• Climate change and biofuel strategy and action plan 
• Stakeholder engagement on sustainability
• Environmental partnerships, including carbon offsets from The Nature Conservancy
•  Sustainability reporting and disclosures through the Corporate Responsibility Report,  
the CDP , the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and corporate customer questionnaires.
EELC Leader Members Include:
• Senior Vice President—Corporate Real Estate
• Managing Director—Global Environment, Sustainability and Compliance
• Senior Vice President—Fuel Management
• Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer
• Vice President—Brand Management
• Senior Vice President—Flight Operations
• Vice President—Investor Relations
• Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

In 2018, day-to-day environmental events were addressed by the affected 
operational division. While the EELC serves as the primary governance body 
responsible for addressing ESG policy risks, the Board of Directors’ Corporate 
Governance Committee and the Delta Risk, Privacy and Compliance Council 
also maintain oversight. In 2018, the EELC received no reports of critical ESG 
concerns or issues. However, we remain aware of concerns related to the 
impact of carbon emissions and climate change from the aviation industry. In 
recognition of industry concerns, we are actively engaged with ICAO efforts 
to establish an efficiency standard and a carbon neutral growth initiative.BOARD EDUCATION & COMMUNICATION
The Board recognizes the importance of continuing education and encourages 
members to take advantage of education opportunities at Delta’s expense. 
Additionally, the Board remains in touch with stakeholder concerns through 
several communication processes.
The Board and the EELC are also regularly briefed on trends related to material 
issues and on stakeholder ESG concerns. Relating directly to ESG, the Board 
enhances its knowledge by:
• Reviewing ESG industry trends related to strategy, performance, policies and goals
• Reviewing other Delta governance body reports
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS & LOBBYING TRANSPARENCY 1,2
In 2018, DeltaPAC gave $1,192,500 to federal-level candidates, committees and party 
committees. In 2018, corporate spending for federal lobbying expenses totaled 
$3,287,092 and state level corporate political contributions totaled $476,217.
RISK MANAGEMENT

commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce 
the returns or results we expect.
•  We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious 
accident involving our aircraft or aircraft of our airline partners.
•  Breaches or lapses in the security of our technology systems and the data we 
store could compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to

and other covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in 
events of default.

The two most important documents we use to verify that our suppliers adhere 
to sustainable business practices are our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier 
Sustainability Guidelines. The Supplier Code of Conduct is distributed to all 
vendors, who are required to read and agree to comply with all requirements. 
To further ensure continuous improvement, we offer a Supplier Performance 
Management program. The program includes the use of monthly performance 
scorecards and periodic business reviews that may include discussions of developing 
and maintaining sustainable business processes. In 2018 most operationally critical 
suppliers participated in business reviews and scorecarding activities. Taking ESG 
factors into account when we select suppliers adds shareholder value by reducing risks. 
It also addresses customer desires to do business with a company that values ethical 
business practices.SUPPLY CHAIN
Delta is firmly committed to social, environmental and economic responsibility 
in all our operations. Delta’s Supply Chain Management (SCM) professionals 
operate at a level befitting a global airline leader, following rigorous internal 
material standards for sourcing, procurement and selection of our suppliers 
and business partners.
Delta’s SCM organization has multiple units that partner with business 
divisions to formulate business and sourcing strategies to deliver sustainable 
results to the company. This ensures a continuous supply of cost-competitive, 
quality goods and services that meet responsibility requirements. SCM is a 
component of the long-term sustainable support we provide to our customers. 
This is why we work hand in hand with vendors and suppliers to manage the 
services and products they provide.
There are many links in our supply chain beyond procurement. These include 
logistics, distribution, materials management and transportation.
We partner with our suppliers and business units to manage services using the 
following values:
• Integrity and ethical behavior
• Fact-based decision-making
• Challenging the status quo
• Enhancing shareholder value
• Diversity
• Teamwork
• Continuous improvement
• Respect for people and the value they bring
• Innovation
• Excellence in performance
SUPPLIER ESG ASSESSMENT
Our strategic sourcing process defines how we work with suppliers to ensure 
that they are operating up to our standards. We actively engage with NGOs, 
industry peers and other stakeholders to develop our strategic sourcing 
process to best address ESG issues within our supply chain. This includes a 
due-diligence policy to screen all key suppliers for potential environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) risk factors. Following this process helps eliminate 
any potential negative impacts of our global supply chain—which in turn 
helps Delta improve. We hold ourselves to the same high standards as our 
suppliers, adhering to operational ESG requirements and using mechanisms for 
monitoring, reporting and correcting ESG issues.
As part of our Procurement Policy, we seek to understand and mitigate supplier 
risk when making sourcing decisions. A key part of this policy includes assessing 
the following ESG risk factors: 
APPENDIX83
DEL TA AIR LINES, INC.  |  2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTSUPPLIER 
DIVERSITY
Delta recognizes the critical role suppliers play in our global value chain. As a 
global service provider, “local” to us means maximizing our responsible returns 
to stakeholders through diversity and by requiring significant expenditures in the 
communities we serve. Expenditures include contracted labor, facility rents and 
landing fees that support local airport station operations across the Delta system.
Commitment to diversity in our supply chain means ensuring that our supplier 
base reflects the diversity of our customers. To do this, we set annual spend 
targets with minority- and women-owned businesses, and we measure progress 
toward achieving these targets.
In 2018, we spent $1.379 million with minority, veteran, LGBTQ and women-owned 
businesses, a 14.3 percent increase over 2017. We’ve achieved this high level by 
identifying viable, diverse companies—then helping them understand and develop 
the capabilities required to compete successfully for Delta business. We encourage 
our Tier I suppliers to build similar relationships with diverse businesses.
