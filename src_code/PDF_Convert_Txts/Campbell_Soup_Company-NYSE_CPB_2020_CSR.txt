In 1869, a fruit merchant had a simple idea: to make the most 
delicious food with the best ingredients affordable to all. Rooted in 
natural ingredients, sourced responsibly, and delivering the same 
delicious taste, every time. 150 years later, we’re still staying true to 
those ideals while striving to fulfill our purpose, Real food that 
matters for life’s moments. This report demonstrates the progress 
we made in fiscal 2019 across our Corporate Responsibility 
priorities, focusing on the family of brands that now make up 
Campbell Soup Company.ROOTED IN

LEAD US FORWARD
WE ARE DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE OF OUR 
PURPOSE BY ADVANCING OUR COMMITMENT TO 
REAL FOOD, TRANSPARENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY, 
AND BY FOSTERING DEEP COMMUNITY 
CONNECTIONS WHERE WE HAVE OPERATIONS.
Mark Clouse
President and CEO
In January 2019, I was named Campbell’s President 
and CEO. Having spent my entire career in the food 
business, I was very familiar with Campbell and  
its brands when I joined. Since then, my respect 
for the company and confidence in our employees 
has only grown. This is based not only on the 
company’s rich history; but also on the progress  
we have made to strengthen Campbell’s foundation 
in support of our growth plans.
In 2019, Campbell celebrated its 150th anniversary, a significant 
milestone. Not many companies have endured such a test of 
time, particularly given the rapidly changing business environ-
ment. But Campbell Soup Company has staying power. This is  
a testament to our heritage and the 
iconic brands that Campbell 
employees – past and present – 
have created and continue to 
nurture and grow. It is also a 
testament to our efforts to improve 
the communities where we live and 
work and act as good stewards of 
our natural resources. 
As we celebrated our history, we took the opportunity to look 
ahead to define our future. This past year, we introduced a new 
strategic plan that we are confident will create value for all of 
our stakeholders. Campbell’s Strategic Objectives
One of the key pillars of our new strategy is to “Deliver on 
the promise of our purpose.” To do this, we are advancing 
our commitment to real food, transparency and sustainability, 
and to fostering deep community connections where we 
have operations.
With this new strategy in place, Campbell is now a focused brand 
powerhouse centered in North America with two divisions: Snacks 
and Meals & Beverages. These two core businesses are comprised 
of iconic brands and united by our values and our purpose, Real 
food that matters for life’s moments. These words ring truer today 
than they ever have, and we are delivering our purpose through 
the brands that consumers know, trust and love. 
I am pleased with how we have advanced our corporate 
responsibility goals and priorities. We have started to 
demonstrate that we can deliver improved financial perfor-
mance while also meeting our sustainability commitments.
This year’s report provides details on these advancements, but I 
would like to highlight several that I find particularly meaningful.DEAR CAMPBELL STAKEHOLDERS,
4Driving Sustainable Change
Our commitment to sustainability can be traced back to our 
founding, when we began canning products. Steel cans are the 
most recycled packaging in the United States, and we have 
trusted them to protect and preserve our food for 150 years. 
Our consumers expect us to do what is right, from responsibly 
sourcing our ingredients to making our food with care. We 
continue to put practices in place that will help build a more 
resilient and sustainable food system.
One such example is our partnership with Land O’Lakes SUSTAIN™ 
to engage wheat growers in more sustainable growing practices 
through farmer engagement and training. Wheat is an important 
ingredient in our portfolio and enables us to deliver more than 
a billion servings of whole grains annually into the marketplace 
through products like our Pepperidge Farm Whole Grain breads 
and Goldfish crackers. We have successfully enrolled 10,000 
acres of wheat from a Pepperidge Farm sourcing region into the 
SUSTAIN™ program and recently expanded the initiative to an 
additional 60,000 acres.
Not surprisingly, tomatoes are Campbell’s largest crop. These 
tomatoes make their way into 60 million U.S. homes every year 
through products such as Campbell's tomato soup (each can of 
which contains six tomatoes), Prego pasta sauces and Pace  
Mexican sauces. Since 2012, in partnership with our tomato 
farmers, we have reduced the amount of water used to grow 
this important crop by 25 percent and cut greenhouse gas 
emissions by 26 percent. 
We also continued to drive sustainability through initiatives  
to improve our packaging. In 2018, Campbell acquired the 
Kettle Brand. Recently, we redesigned our Kettle Brand chip 
bags, resulting in a 43 percent reduction in plastic. With this 
change, we will keep 2 million pounds of plastic out of  
landfills every year. In fiscal 2020, we plan to build upon this  
by introducing new packaging sustainability commitments to 
further reduce our environmental impact.
Fostering a Sense of Community 
Campbell believes that real food should be accessible to 
everyone – and that starts in our hometowns, where our 
employees live and work.
This belief demands that we give back to our local communities. To 
build on this legacy, Campbell formalized five community goals to 
improve the quality of life in our hometowns. By fiscal 2025 we will:
1. Increase food access for 100,000 residents in Campbell 
communities
2. Provide nutrition education to 50,000 people to encourage 
healthy living in Campbell communities
3. Invest $5 million to improve the school food environment 
for children
4. Engage 70 percent of Campbell employees in community- 
based activities
5. Contribute 75,000 traditional and skills-based employee 
volunteer hours across Campbell’s footprint to increase the 
capacity of our community partnersAs one of America’s leading food companies, we will make  
a difference in the availability and quality of food for school 
children, particularly in Campbell communities where the 
need is the greatest. We know that one in seven children live in 
hunger and one in three low-income families report not having 
enough food over the summer. For the past year, the Campbell 
Soup Foundation has been working with nonprofit organizations, 
school districts and national thought leaders to design a program 
that will improve food offerings in schools in Camden, New Jersey, 
and four other communities. It is the first step in Campbell’s 
long-term commitment to support school food programs and 
improve access to nutritious food.
Building a Winning Team and Culture
None of this work is possible without our employees. As I wrote 
last year, culture is a serious part of our agenda at Campbell. 
That is why a key element of our strategic plan is to “Build a 
winning team and culture” by leveraging our values and the 
unique family spirit we have developed over 150 years.
When we implemented a new operating model designed to bring 
our strategy to life, we also invested in change management 
capabilities to ensure the smart changes we have made will stick. 
We have made the conscious decision to refocus on our people 
and invest in them. Through our talent management team, we 
introduced three new programs to support our efforts. They 
include a program to improve our operating discipline, execu-
tion and accountability; a program to enhance inclusivity in the 
workplace; and a leadership program that provides our people 
with development opportunities to advance their careers.
In closing, I am proud of the progress we have made in 2019 
against our corporate responsibility and sustainability commit-
ments, especially as we established a new direction for the 
company. I would like to thank our employees who bring our 
purpose to life every day by driving programs. As you read 
about them, I hope you share my enthusiasm for what we have 
accomplished, both in 2019 and throughout our 150-year 
history, and my optimism and excitement for what comes next.

CELEBRATING
150 YEARS
We proudly celebrated 2019 as 
Campbell’s 150th anniversary. 
This anniversary is much more 
than a number for us. It’s a 
testament to Campbell’s heritage 
and to the iconic brands that 
Campbell employees – past and 
present – have created and continue to nurture and grow. 
Not many companies have endured such a test of time, 
particularly given today’s rapidly changing trends. 
Campbell has demonstrated staying power, being guided 
by a clear purpose and a strong corporate responsibility 
and sustainability strategy. Take a look at some key 
milestones along our journey.1876
1948 1914
1961 1980s 20141897
1920sOur original packaging –  
tin cans and glass jars – is 
inherently sustainable, meant to 
be reused over and over again. 
At this time, the company name 
is stamped into the glass so the 
jars can easily be sent back to 
Campbell to be sanitized and 
used again.
Campbell acquires V8 and with 
it, the Napoleon, Ohio, plant. 
With this plant, we can now 
procure vegetables from local 
farmers in Ohio and Michigan.  
Many vegetables going to the 
Napoleon plant continue to 
be sourced from those same 
regions today. Later, this plant 
becomes the first in the legacy 
Campbell family to have  
solar installed on site. Dr. John T. Dorrance becomes 
President of Campbell, and 
his approach to procurement 
becomes the company standard: 
don't buy anything you wouldn't 
put in front of your own family. 
This is where our Real Food 
Philosophy originates. 
Campbell acquires Pepperidge 
Farm, founded by Margaret 
Rudkin in 1937. Margaret 
Rudkin becomes the first 
woman to sit on Campbell’s 
Board of Directors the  
same year.Snyder's of Hanover consolidates its operations in Hanover, 
Pennsylvania, beside a wheat field owned by the brand's 
founder. The wheat from that field is used to make Snyder′s 
of Hanover pretzels, and continues to supply us today.  
Later, the site builds a LEED Gold certified Research  
Center and a 26-acre solar field.Campbell declares its intention  
to be a purpose-driven  
company and launches our 
purpose, Real food that matters 
for life’s moments. The Real 
Food Philosophy, rooted in the 
values of Campbell’s founders 
is launched in 2016.Dr. John T. Dorrance invents 
condensed soup. By con-
densing soup and letting 
consumers add the water at 
home, the cans are smaller 
and lighter, which in turn 
means using less steel  
and less fuel when  
shipping to customers.
Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, John Dorrance and 
his wife, Ethel, host annual meetings for farmers at 
their home on Campbell's research farm in New Jersey. 
Campbell's in-house agricultural experts discuss new 
growing techniques and methods, educating our farmers 
on crop rotation, water savings, seed selection and how 
to maximize yields.

As a food company, we continually evolve our business to meet market conditions, best practices, and social and 
environmental demands. We take the same approach with our corporate responsibility strategy. After a series of 
key acquisitions and divestitures over the last two years, we took a step back in 2019 and reevaluated our focus 
areas and targets against a renewed Campbell. We asked ourselves where we could have the greatest impact with  
our new family of brands and have evolved to reflect that new focus. And while we remain committed to our strategy, 
we have made some changes to our public goals.

GOAL #5Provide nutrition education 
to 50,000  people  to 
encourage healthy living in 
Campbell communities. Engage 70 percent  of

in Campbell communities.WE ADDED FIVE NEW MEASURABLE GOALS TO  
GAUGE OUR PERFORMANCE IN THE COMMUNITY
We have made considerable progress in 
our work with nonprofits on tackling hunger 
and expanding nutrition education for our 
communities, especially for children – a 
commitment enthusiastically shared by our 
new family of brands at Pacific Foods and 
those we acquired from Snyder’s-Lance. So, 
in FY2019, we formalized five new FY2025 
community goals to help guide our work 
across brands:CORPORATE  
RESPONSIBILITY STRATEGYWe also eliminated two goals and  
deprioritized one raw material  
Given that we are now primarily a North American company, 
our supplier base changed significantly in 2019, and our 
owned and leased manufacturing facilities are now all in 
North America. While we remain committed to supplier 
diversity and human rights in our operations, we have moved 
away from public commitments in these two areas, as there 
are more material corporate responsibility risks for the 
company to focus on. However, we will continue to include 
information on supplier diversity and human rights in our 
operations in our report.
And with the divestiture of Bolthouse Farms, we no longer use 
the volume of carrots that we used to, eliminating the material 
focus for us as a priority raw material. On the other hand, 
through our acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance and the formation of 
the Campbell Snacks division, we are now one of the largest 
purchasers of chipping potatoes in the country, making our 
family of potato farmers close allies in sustainability.
We continued to make progress in expanding partnerships 
with tomato, potato and wheat farmers, retrofitted our 
facilities and plants with energy-saving technologies, and 
celebrated major wins on the packaging front with Kettle 
Brand, V8 and other brands. All of these showcase the 
intended impact of our strategy.Our strategy is always built with major food industry trends 
in mind. From water scarcity, climate change and animal 
welfare to affordability, nutrition and transparency, we are 
driving impact and will continue to do so with our scale, 
household presence and consumer love. And as we work 
together now to lay the foundation for Campbell’s next  
150 years, we remain resolute in our belief that while the 
world continues to change around us, some things must 
remain constant: our commitment to real food and our 
commitment to transparency.
OUR VISION
We strive to build a more resilient food system, making 
real food that improves the world we all share, for 
generations to come.OUR MISSION
To deliver on the promise of our purpose through 
food that is ethically and sustainably grown, sourced, 
produced and shared.

1.  Due to the sale of the Bolthouse Farms business, carrots are no longer a priority ingredient for Campbell and have been removed from our list of 
priority raw materials. In FY2020, we plan to reassess raw material risks to confirm that this is the appropriate list of priority raw materials, given our 
new family of brands.
2.  We removed two goals from our commitments in 2019, reflecting the change in our portfolio with our recent divestitures and acquisitions and our  
focus as a North American company:
 • By FY2020, measurably advance Campbell’s Supplier Diversity Program
 •  By FY2020, proactively assess 100% of Campbell-owned facilities for compliance with Campbell’s Human Rights Principles 
3.  We have removed our commitment to transition steel cans to non-BPA linings in the U.S. and Canada because we reached the commitment in 2017. 
4. With the divestiture of Kelsen and Arnott’s, 11 percent of Campbell’s portfolio now meets our cage-free egg commitment.
5.  We have integrated Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods into our gestation crate-free commitment. After integrating these acquisitions, the total volume 
of pork in our portfolio has increased and most of this acquired pork volume does not yet meet our animal welfare standards. As a result, our progress 
will show as 18 percent, but our goal has become more robust, and we remain committed to converting this new volume by 2022.
6.  Campbell defines its food waste commitment in accordance with Sustainable Development Goal 12.3. As such, we exclude animal feed and 
biomaterial processing from the scope of our goal.

1.  FY2015 and FY2016 data in this section have been slightly adjusted to reflect a change in how we report that occurred in FY2017 when we shifted from calendar year to 
fiscal year reporting. At that time, this change was not carried back to our historical data, so we have done so in this Report. 
2.  In prior reports, these numbers were mislabeled as kg CO2e/tonne of tomato. They have consistently been measured in metric tons (tonnes) CO2e/U.S. short ton of tomato 
and the units have now been labeled appropriately.
3.  In prior reports, these numbers were mislabeled as pounds Nitrogen/tonne of tomato. They have consistently been measured in pounds Nitrogen/U.S. short ton of tomato 
and the units have now been labeled appropriately.
4.  FY2018 wheat data has been restated in order to include Snyder’s-Lance volumes and to correct a discrepancy in how wheat volumes were reported for this sustainable 
agriculture commitment (percent of goal vs. percent of total volume). We will consistently report percent of total volume for this commitment moving forward.
5. Declined due to divestiture of Kelsen and Arnott’s.
6.  We have integrated data from our recent acquisitions, Pacific Foods and Snyder’s-Lance, and removed data from our recent divestitures, Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh 
Gourmet, Kelsen, Arnott’s and Campbell’s International. We have made these changes back to our FY2017 baseline and have restated FY2017 and FY2018 data.
7.  In FY2019, we generated renewable energy, and in prior years we sold it to others.11

1.   In prior years, Scope 3 emissions included only employee business travel by car, plane and train. In FY2019, Campbell estimated additional emissions categories, including Purchased 
Goods and Services, Capital Goods, Fuel and Energy Related Activities, Waste Generated in Operations, Business Travel, Employee Commuting, Upstream Leased Assets, Downstream 
Transportation and Distribution, and End of Life Treatment of Sold Products. We have also corrected a unit error from kg to metric tons, removed divestitures and included acquisitions.
2.  The Plum Organics brand purchases carbon offsets to cover the GHG emissions associated with its office footprint. In FY2019, these offsets represented the portion of the office space 
that Plum employees occupied at our Camden, New Jersey, headquarters. In previous years, they represented Plum’s Emeryville, California, office. This office closed in FY2019.
3.  FY2017, FY2018 and FY2019 have been updated due to a data error discovered post-publication.
4.  Safety data for Pacific Foods and the Snyder’s-Lance brands began to be included in FY2018. This contributed to the increase in TRIR and LTIR over FY2017.12

16MATERIALITY
Corporate responsibility topics are considered material for us if 
they influence the judgment and decisions of our external and 
internal stakeholders, as well as having an impact on them and 
our business. In FY2019, we conducted a robust assessment 
with internal and external stakeholders to understand where  
to focus as our company evolves and identified and prioritized 
our material corporate responsibility topics through a four-step 
assessment process.
Step 1: Identify Issues – We reviewed the material corporate 
responsibility topics reported publicly by our peers and assessed 
issues that are trending in the media and with Campbell’s inves-
tors, customers, suppliers and NGO partners. From this research, 
we added a few new topics to our list, including Risk and Crisis 
Management, Product Innovation, Supply Chain Resilience and 
Commodity Availability, Pesticides and Chemical Contaminants, 
Women’s Empowerment and Responsible Use of Technology.
 
Step 2: Survey Stakeholders – We surveyed internal and external 
stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, retail customers, 
NGOs, trade associations, etc. We also posted the survey on 
Twitter for consumer feedback, which we received. The survey 
asked stakeholders to rate the importance of 25 topics in four 
broad categories: Responsible Business Practices, Societal Impact and Labor Practices, Product Responsibility and Environmental 
Responsibility. Stakeholders were also asked, of the 17 United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals, where Campbell could 
have the most impact. The responses reaffirmed our previous 
alignment with Goals 2, 3, 8, 10, 12 and 13. We received nearly 
1,500 responses in total with employees accounting for  
88 percent of responses.
 
Step 3: Survey Leadership – We surveyed Campbell leadership 
to understand how the 25 topics might impact the business over 
the next five years. Leaders from across the business were asked 
to rate our ability to control potential impacts, the likelihood of 
such impacts and how these might impact our reputation, 
strategic plan, purpose and/or values.
 
Step 4: Validate – The results of the assessment were shared 
with leaders across the business who provide feedback on the 
topics. These results were validated against the results of the 
research along with the feedback of our Campbell leaders. The 
results are shared below and are reevaluated throughout the 
year, as topics can shift in priority. We did see significant shifts 
in the rating of select topics compared to our last assessment 
in FY2016, including the ranking of Transparency along with 
Health, Nutrition and Wellness, among others.

GROWNReal food has roots. Roots in natural ingredients, delicious taste and sustainable 
agriculture. Real food has roots in quality and heritage. And our focus on 
integrating sustainability principles into how we grow our food and nurture our 
land continues in partnership with farmers across the country. 
Campbell’s priority ingredients for sustainable agriculture are tomatoes, wheat, potatoes, soy 
and jalapeños – ingredients important to our brands and our stakeholders. In fact, with the 
acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance and the formation of the Campbell Snacks division, we are now 
one of the largest purchasers of chipping potatoes in America.
We recognize our impact can be significant. That’s why we have 
been working on projects that conserve natural resources, improve 
livelihoods on farms and connect farmers with the latest innova-
tions and data analytics. These efforts empower farmers to make 
better-informed decisions. They also help us be transparent with 
our customers and consumers on the progress we make and on 
challenges that are too complex to be solved with short-term 
solutions. After all, real food must also be rooted in respect for 
nature – and we continue to learn from nature about how to best 
nurture it while growing enough food sustainably and responsibly 
to feed an ever-growing world.
Partnerships are a core component of our approach. In 2019, we 
partnered with The Sustainability Consortium (TSC) to help launch  
a task force on Responsible Pest Management. We assisted in 
recruiting a broader set of members for the task force and helped 
inform its guidelines and objectives. The task force is up and running 
and currently working to collect and analyze available data on pest 
management. The goal: to develop metrics and tools which can be 
used by farmers and companies to measure and report responsible 
pest management, and identify opportunities to reduce risk on farms. OUR APPROACH

1.  In prior reports, these numbers were mislabeled as kg CO2e/tonne of tomato. They have consistently been measured in metric tons (tonnes) CO2e/U.S. short ton of tomato and 
the units have now been labeled appropriately.
2.  In prior reports, these numbers were mislabeled as pounds Nitrogen/tonne of tomato. They have consistently been measured in pounds Nitrogen/U.S. short ton of tomato and the 
units have now been labeled appropriately.22In 2015, we set a goal to enroll 70,000 acres of wheat in a 
fertilizer optimization plan by 2020. In 2018, we expanded  
our commitment by setting a target to sustainably source  
50 percent of our wheat by 2025.
To accomplish these goals, we collaborated with Land O’Lakes 
SUSTAIN™ and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) as they 
developed a data analytics tool called the Truterra™ Insights Engine. 
This data platform helps farmers advance their environmental 
stewardship acre-by-acre and see the financial return on their 
sustainability investments. It also creates a framework for 
continuous improvement while benchmarking against yield 
and profitability to ensure 
specific and scalable 
on-farm solutions that 
benefit both natural 
resources and the farmer.
Additionally, the SUSTAIN™ 
partnership leverages the 
nationwide network of Land 
O’Lakes’ agricultural retailers. 
As trusted advisors to 
farmers, these retailers are 
ideally positioned to deploy 
the Truterra™ Insights Engine, 
deliver expert advice on 
each field, and facilitate flows 
of information between 
farmers and other partners 
in the wheat value chain. In 2017, we launched the first phase of our wheat sustainability 
program in the Chesapeake Bay watershed area of Maryland 
and Pennsylvania. Here, SUSTAIN™ began working with local 
agricultural retailer, The Mill, to advance stewardship efforts 
with farmers across 10,000 acres of wheat. Activities included 
direct farmer engagement; conservation trainings for both The 
Mill and their farmers; and deployment of the Truterra™ Insights 
Engine to collect an array of data, generate a baseline of  
results for each field, and identify areas of improvement for 
each farmer. 
From this baseline assessment, we learned that many farmers 
in Maryland and Pennsylvania have already adopted several 
growing practices that mitigate nutrient loss and runoff while 
building healthy soil. Early baseline results included that, 
among the acres assessed:
• 55 percent have cover crops,
•  89 percent benefit from a nitrogen management plan; and
•  75 percent receive split application of fertilizer.
Once we had an in-depth snapshot of the farmland acre-by-
acre, we began working to build on this progress to further 
enhance farm stewardship, productivity and resiliency. The 
ultimate goal: to equip wheat farmers with new tools to help 
protect the air, land and water – and the economic health  
of their farm – while supporting sustainability across the  
supply chain. 
In 2019, we began collaborating with Heritage Cooperative 
to launch a similar effort in Ohio, another important wheat 
sourcing region for Campbell. By the end of FY2019, Heritage 
had engaged about 20,000 acres of wheat in the SUSTAIN™ 
program and was moving quickly toward our 2020 target.GROWN // STORIES OF PROGRESS
NEW DATA ANALYTICS TOOL HELPS ADVANCE 
WHEAT FARMERS’ SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS 
23
The most notable strengths of our tomato supply chain relate to 
our partnership with our tomato farmers. Two key aspects are 
the proximity of the family-owned farms we work with – many 
within just five miles of our processing plants – and the close 
and long-term relationships we enjoy with our tomato farmers, 
some of them working with us since the 1940s. 
Working closely with these 
farmers and seed compa-
nies each year, we select 
tomato varieties that have 
higher initial “tomato solids” 
content (sugars, minerals, 
proteins, etc.). This helps to 
reduce the amount of en-
ergy required to evaporate 
the water out of them to 
create tomato paste. In the 
fields, farmers increasingly 
adopt drip irrigation, which 
helps save water, and regularly test soil samples to optimize 
fertilizer use. For years, we have worked with growers individu-
ally to embed sustainability into field management, while using 
data to inform best practices.Sustainability doesn’t just stop at the edge of the tomato field.  
It is also embedded throughout our plant operations. Over  
90 percent of the tomatoes that go into Campbell products 
come from our two tomato processing plants in California at 
Dixon and Stockton. Acquired in 1976, these two plants serve 
as an important step in our tomatoes’ journey as they ultimately 
make their way into over 60 million households across the 
United States every year. And there is not a single part of the 
tomato that is wasted in the process. The tomato ingredients 
are crafted via Campbell’s proprietary methods specifically for 
use in our high-quality product recipes.
The people at our plants have their own personal stories, rich 
with appreciation for Campbell, their work and the familial 
bonds they have established over decades. The average 
length of employment at our tomato plants is 20 years, but 
some workers have been working at the plants for over 40 
years. Three Dixon, California, plant employees – Rosalio, 
Eugenia and Sara – have been there since 1975, when the 
plant opened. Our operations manager started at the plant 
when he was 18 years old as a mechanic, and one of our top 
mechanics began his career years ago as a sorter on the line. 
And it goes on. These are the stories that make us proud –  
and help us live up to our Real Food Philosophy, one tomato  
at a time.WHEN IT COMES TO TOMATOES, WE’RE FAMIL Y

24Our plant-based priority ingredients are tomatoes, wheat, 
potatoes, soy and jalapeños. Here’s a snapshot of how we 
continued to work toward our sustainable agriculture goals 
in FY2019:
Tomatoes
Given how critical tomatoes are as the largest ingredient 
category for our Meals & Beverages division, we continue to 
prioritize working with farmers on embedding sustainable 
agricultural practices. In FY2019, drip irrigation adoption 
increased to cover 78 percent of tomato acres. Because of this, 
water used to irrigate Campbell tomatoes has been reduced  
by 25 percent per pound of tomato since 2012. CO 2 emissions 
from fertilizer use also dropped 26 percent in the same period, 
helping farmers become more resource efficient while also 
increasing yields.
Over the years, we have worked with farmers in other ways  
as well, helping them write grant proposals for state funds to 
incorporate sustainability efforts that meet the state of California’s 
requirements for GHG reductions from business and agriculture. 
And, on an individual basis throughout the year, we provide 
them with know-how and best practices on things such as 
irrigation scheduling technologies. Finally, we’ve started working 
more closely with our brand teams to spotlight our family farmers 
and partners in the field through ongoing social media engage-
ment, including advertorials, a #TomatoTuesday Twitter series 
(held during the harvesting season to connect consumers to the 
origins of their beloved tomato products through sustainability 
messages), as well as a YouTube video partnership with Prego 
Farmers Market featuring one of our family farmers.
Wheat
In 2019 we began to work with Heritage Cooperative in Ohio to 
launch a SUSTAIN™ partnership with wheat growers in our Ohio 
sourcing region. The cooperative is owned by farmers and also 
provides agriculture inputs and farm management advice. We 
have a goal of enrolling 60,000 acres of wheat into this sustain-
able management program in Ohio by the end of 2020. And by 
the end of FY2019, our new partner had already enrolled 20,000 
acres and was moving quickly toward achieving the full goal.
Potatoes
In 2018, Campbell greatly increased its sourcing of potatoes with 
the acquisition of Kettle Brand, Cape Cod, Jays and Tom’s  chip 
brands. We have been laying the groundwork to launch a 2020 
potato sustainability program, by baselining how our farmers 
have been managing environmental and social issues to identify opportunities for improvement. Kettle Brand’s longstanding 
commitment to sustainability and its tradition of transparently 
telling farmer stories already gives us a fantastic foundation to 
build on!
Soy
Soybeans are legumes that use little fertilizer, while adding 
organic matter to the soil, making it a good crop for rotating with 
grains and other row crops. We source all of our soy domestically 
in the United States and in 2019, began building relationships 
with the soybean industry to learn about sustainability efforts  
in our supply chain. The United Soybean Board invited our then 
Manager of Sustainable Agriculture to be featured in a video on 
soybean sustainability efforts which furthered these relationships.
Jalapeños
In 2019, we initiated Sustainability and Responsible Sourcing 
self-assessments with some of the suppliers of the jalapeños 
used in our Pace salsas. We anticipate using the baseline data 
for expanded assessments in FY2020.GROWN // STORIES OF PROGRESS
SUSTAINING OUR PRIORITY INGREDIENTS: BUILDING 
RELATIONSHIPS, INVESTING IN THE LONG TERM
A FARMER ONLY GETS 40 CHANCES
Prego Farmers Market 
partnered with YouTube 
channel True Food TV 
for “How Does it Grow ,” 
the story of processing 
tomatoes. The show 
features Campbell farmer 
Dustin Timothy and his 
now-retired father Ron –  
capturing the harvest through their eyes. Dustin is the fifth- 
generation operator of his family’s farm and is familiar with 
the many complications and complexities of bringing a crop 
to harvest. His father reflects, “As a farmer you only get 
maybe 40 to 45 chances, because you got 40 or 45 years 
in your career. You can’t make too many mistakes.” Building 
on Ron’s experience and technological advancements, Dustin 
employs a whole suite of tools to maintain his farm’s health, 
including crop rotation between tomatoes and sunflowers, 
and drip irrigation for water savings. In 2019, he was able  
to reduce water use by 30 percent per acre – as the next 
season approaches, the work continues.
25In 2007, we established the Campbell Soup Company Fund  
for Research in Sustainable Agriculture in Vegetables at the 
University of California, Davis (UC Davis) College of Agricultural 
and Environmental Sciences to support education and public 
outreach about sustainable agriculture and research. The 
endowment has helped fund over a decade of critical research 
in natural pest management, soil health, crop rotation, cover 
crops, nitrogen uptake, and water and drought management. 
The research has helped uncover new sustainable practices 
and opportunities for us, including work in 2011 on the reduc-
tion of CO 2 emissions through drip irrigation, which has been  
a cornerstone of our tomato sustainability program. And in 2017, 
UC Davis students worked in the field and labs to better 
understand the long-term impact on soil health from improved 
farm management practices over a 20-year period.GROWN // STORIES OF PROGRESS

SOURCEDOne of the key principles of our Real Food Philosophy is that Transparency 
Builds Trust – and as we celebrated our 150th year in 2019, this holds true  
today more than ever. Our consumers expect us to do what’s right and be  
transparent with them – from the farm to their kitchen counter.
Whether that’s growing our food sustainably, sourcing our key ingredients responsibly or 
reducing our overall impact on the environment. In 2019, we took the opportunity to review our 
15 key ingredients – 14 food ingredients and paper packaging – and began creating a plan to 
ultimately ensure that everything we source is done so responsibly. The way to get there will 
require diverse solutions, partnerships and focus – and we are committed to working closely 
with suppliers, farmers and others on making that happen. We’ve already engaged more than 
250 suppliers from all of our 15 priority categories, including our top six paper packaging 
suppliers, to gain transparency into where our raw materials come from.
In 2019, Campbell became a member of Sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange), bolstering the 
company’s commitment to responsible sourcing and transparency. Sedex enables Campbell 
to better understand how our suppliers conduct business and hold them accountable to 
environmental, labor, health and safety, and business ethics standards. Supplier auditing 
will begin in 2020.
Similarly, our approach to packaging is based on research, consumer trends 
and where we can have the greatest impact. Operating as a responsible 
business requires that we focus our efforts on what will ultimately change 
consumer behavior, not piecemeal short-term solutions. This has led us  
to set three key priorities for packaging sustainability:
• Reducing the amount of packaging sent to landfill;
•  Increasing the use of post-consumer recycled materials in our  
packages; and
•  Increasing recycling rates through education and infrastructure. 
Together, these multipronged solutions will allow us to more systemically eliminate the environ-
mental impact of our packaging for the long term and ensure we are working toward building a 
clean, sustainable future.OUR APPROACH

Following our acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods, 
we spent much of 2019 reorganizing how we approach and 
implement our responsible sourcing function. This included 
evaluating and mapping our key ingredients, revisiting our 
commitments to make sure they continue to reflect our product 
portfolio and consumer expectations, building a foundation of 
data to help identify hot spots and opportunities for remediation, 
and engaging with key suppliers to conduct due diligence and 
ensure compliance with our responsible sourcing code. 
One key result of the work was the further integration of 
responsible sourcing into the procurement function. Now, 
every new ingredient review includes a member of the 
responsible sourcing team to ensure additional social and 
environmental oversight and that, right from the start, every 
approved ingredient is being traced through an ingredient database all the way to its country of origin. This will ensure 
we are building consistent and systematic traceability beyond 
country of manufacturing. 
Campbell uses animal-derived ingredients in products ranging 
from soup and broth to cookies and crackers. We remain 
dedicated to and continue to partner with our suppliers to 
advance the humane treatment of animals, including a commit-
ment to transition exclusively to cage-free eggs in our supply 
chain by 2025. Currently, our Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse  
cookies and Chunk cookies are baked only with cage-free eggs. 
Through a whole-bird model, which allows us full transparency 
into the life cycle of the chicken, we ensure that all the chicken 
meat we use is raised with No Antibiotics Ever (NAE). In addition, 
we have aligned with peers in our industry to move toward higher 
broiler chicken welfare standards by 2024, which would include:
• Providing more space for chickens by reducing stocking 
density to a maximum of six pounds per square foot
• Offering improved environments including litter, lighting 
and enrichment
• Processing chickens in a manner that avoids pre-stun 
handling and instead uses multistep, controlled  
atmospheric stunning
• Transitioning to breeds of birds approved by Royal Society for 
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) or the Global 
Animal Partnership (GAP) and, which are scientifically recog-
nized as having higher welfare outcomes (deadline: 2026)
• Using third-party auditing to ensure complianceWith the acquisition of Pacific Foods, 13 percent of our 
chicken supply is certified GAP 2 by the Global Animal 
Partnership, which includes three of the five criteria  
for higher broiler chicken welfare. 
In 2012, we committed to eliminating gestation crates from our 
pork supply chain and have been making steady progress. 
Over the past year, we learned that while pigs are spending 
less time in gestation crates, the crates were still used at 
certain times. We’ve worked with our suppliers and  
the University of Pennsylvania to better understand housing 
systems for pigs and their social behaviors. As a result, we are 
using the Ohio Livestock Care Standards to define our commit-
ment. While we remain committed to ultimately eliminating the 
use of gestation crates and are partnering with suppliers to 
limit the amount of time spent by pigs in crates, there may 
be occasions when keeping pigs out of group housing may 
be beneficial for the well-being of all pigs by reducing 
unwanted aggression.REFRESHING WHAT RESPONSIBLE SOURCING CAN DELIVER
ENSURING THE HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS SOURCED // STORIES OF PROGRESS
2930We also spent time in FY2019 to refresh how we approach supplier diversity and what it 
should and could include, as well as reestablishing how these certifications are tracked and 
updated. Based on what we heard from our suppliers and farmers, we are working to make 
the definition of “diverse supplier” in 2020 more inclusive, expanding the types of certifi-
cations we accept and recognizing small business. This allows more of our suppliers to be 
recognized as diverse, without having to worry about the costliness of certain certifications. 
This would especially benefit our diverse farmers who may be able to get a different type of 
accreditation/certification from their local municipalities at a much lower cost.
When we acquired the Snyder’s-Lance portfolio in 2019, we 
worked hard to map the brands that joined the Campbell family 
against our existing 100 percent certified RSPO palm oil commit -
ment. We are excited to be integrating these brands into our 
commitment and are on target to achieve 100 percent certifica -
tion by the end of FY2021. Transparency and collaboration 
will remain key priorities for us as we continue to formalize 
our commitments and work across the areas of animal 
welfare, human rights, climate change and unsustainable 
resource consumption.
REESTABLISHING THE SCOPE OF CERTIFICATIONS
OUR RSPO JOURNEYSOURCED // STORIES OF PROGRESS
31Working in close partnership, our packaging and operations 
teams made a seemingly simple change to our V8  labels in 
2019 to make the containers easier to recycle. While the V8  
bottles have always been easily recyclable, the shrink sleeve 
labels around them were not. This is a common challenge 
because rigid plastics, like bottles, are easier to recycle than 
flexible plastics, like labels. 
This becomes even more challenging when a shrink sleeve 
label covers the full bottle. Current recycling technology 
cannot always sort bottles that use full-coverage shrink sleeve 
labels. This meant that prior to this label change, consumers 
needed to remove the outer label before they put the plastic 
bottle in their recycling bins.To overcome this challenge, we 
changed our labels on V8 V-Fusion  
and V8 Blends multiserve bottles, 
from shrink sleeve labels to wrap 
labels that cover only part of the 
bottle. Recycling technology can now easily sort the bottles 
and remove the wrap label in the municipal recycling process. 
Now our consumers no longer need to remove the labels 
before placing V8  bottles into their recycling bins. The result: 
tens of millions of bottles can now be fully recycled with ease. 
The newly designed packaging hit store shelves in July 2019 
and showcases how we continue to make our packaging 
more sustainable. 
V8 V-FUSION AND BLENDS BOTTLES,   
NOW FULL Y RECYCLABLE  SOURCED // STORIES OF PROGRESS
While we continuously strive to improve our 
packaging, our soups have used steel cans 
for more than a century. Campbell has trusted 
the can to protect and preserve our food for 
millions of families. This infinitely recyclable 
packaging is part of our heritage and plays an important role in our portfolio today. Steel 
cans are the most recycled packaging material 
in the United States, with a recycling rate of 
over 70 percent. That means that the steel 
used in cans produced by Campbell 100 years 
ago could very well make up our cans today!LOVING THE CAN SINCE 1869
One of our newly acquired brands is Kettle Brand. Sustainability 
has been a part of Kettle Brand’s Natural Promise for decades. 
When you open a bag of Kettle Brand chips, you expect real 
ingredients made by real people, sustainably. The brand team 
applied that same principle to the snack’s environmental footprint 
in 2019 when they redesigned the bag, resulting in a 43 percent 
reduction in plastic. What’s more, the associated GHG emissions 
from packaging are down by half and will help keep 2 million 
pounds of plastic from going to the landfill each year. 
The efforts have paid off in another big way: the previous bag 
design was historically difficult to open without using scissors. 
Now with less packaging, the bag is easy to open without  
sacrificing quality. 
Packaging is a critical piece of our 
environmental footprint – and one we 
have made a priority to reduce. What 
makes it complicated is that often the 
impact is directly reliant on consumers’ 
product use and disposal. In order to 
make more and more of our packag-
ing from recycled content, we need to 
advance two parallel efforts: keep 
packaging out of landfills as much as 
possible and ensure that there is a 
steady stream of clean recycled 
material. In 2008, the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC) 
launched a project to look into how consumers engage with 
on-pack labeling and whether there could be a standardized 
way of helping make recycling easy and guess-free. The result 
was the first consumer-facing How2Recycle label, launched 
publicly in 2012.
Three years later, the results are in – and responses indicate 
that the label inspires better behavior and cleaner recycling 
streams, also affirmed by our Plum Organics brand team, an 
early adopter of the label in 2017. So, in 2019, we expanded 
How2Recycle labels to six additional brands:
• Campbell’s
• Prego
• SpaghettiOs
• Swanson
• V8
• Well Yes!
• GoldfishFor 2020, we are reviewing all pack formats across Meals & 
Beverages and Snacks for additional opportunities to implement 
the label. Many of these will require label redesign, resizing and/or 
other adjustments to make the label work, but we are optimistic 
and look forward to rolling them out soon.KETTLE BRAND’S NATURAL PROMISE  EXTENDS TO ITS BAG

PRODUCEDReal food is rooted in care – care for our natural resources, for quality and safety, 
and for our planet. As the world’s population rises, so does the urgency of  
continuing to produce enough food to feed everyone amid a changing climate.
In FY2019, we focused on learning how our new brands approach sustainability, reexamining our 
commitments and roadmaps, and developing a comprehensive approach to continue making 
progress against our goals. We have much to be proud of and on which to build. Our operational 
sustainability program started in earnest in 2010 when we set our first series of commitments to 
reduce water and energy usage, as well as improve our recycle rates.  
In FY2017, we set new environmental commit-
ments to reflect who we were at that time. Now 
looking forward, our newly acquired brands 
will reshape Campbell’s sustainability program 
once again. In 2019, we integrated our acquired 
businesses into our data systems and goals and 
removed our divested businesses. We have reset 
our FY2017 baseline for our public commitments 
to reflect these changes and continue to strive to manage our impacts on the environment. 
And with our new family of brands, we have increased our on-
site renewable impact to a total of five solar installations and 
two fuel cells that generate renewable electricity for Campbell, 
contributing to our renewable energy commitment.
We completed a water risk assessment in FY2019 to better under-
stand our regional water risks, continued to improve energy effi-
ciency at our plants, made progress against our food waste and 
waste-to-landfill goals, and consolidated our Global Food Safety 
Initiative (GFSI) certification under NSF International, known for 
their rigorous food safety standards. Producing our food with care 
is of utmost importance to us – whether it’s the energy or water 
used to make it or our approach to eliminating waste from our 
system – and one that we will continue to prioritize.OUR APPROACH

renewable  
electricity10% For Kettle Brand, sustainability comes first – and supporting 
renewable energy was a natural choice back in 2003 when 
600 solar panels were installed on the roof of the Salem, 
Oregon, plant – then the largest solar array of its kind in the 
Pacific Northwest. The panels generate 120,000 kWh per 
year, enough electricity to produce 272,000 bags of chips 
and avoid 85 tonnes of CO 2 emissions annually. 
Additionally, the Salem, Oregon, site offsets 100 percent of its 
electricity use by purchasing wind credits, eliminating 14,850 
tonnes of CO 2 emissions annually as a result. That’s equal to 
taking 3,153 cars off the road every year. 
In FY2019, we conducted a comprehensive water risk assessment 
encompassing all of our plants. In partnership with a third-party 
firm, we looked at water from three risk categories:
• Local basin-level water risk 
• Assessment of future water risk 
• Financial or strategic water risk impacts on the business
The assessment included 
benchmarking against peers, 
evaluating facility-level water 
risk using a variety of screening-  
level tools, analyzing a 
preliminary set of most-at-
risk facilities with additional 
data, including value at risk, 
as well as on-site interviews 
to validate and refine model 
findings and document best practices. The process and 
results were then reviewed with internal stakeholders.Ultimately, after applying multiple risk models and conducting plant 
interviews, it was determined that none of Campbell’s facilities are 
currently at high risk for water quality and/or quantity impacts. The 
assessment found that our programs and management approach-
es were leading or near leading among our peers and sector 
leaders. It also highlighted an opportunity to better connect our 
stewardship with setting risk-informed goals and incorporating 
water as a material risk into our governance. In FY2020, we plan to 
incorporate the key findings of the assessment into an action plan.
High on our list will be replicating the risk assessment process 
every year, establishing a stakeholder group of cross-functional 
leaders, reporting back findings and beginning to assess 
supply chain risks. Additionally, we completed third-party 
assurance of our water data for the very first time.ASSESSING OUR WATER STEWARDSHIP AND RISKS PRODUCED // STORIES OF PROGRESS

36KETTLE BRAND CHIPS, POWERED BY NATURE37Making real food is the foundation of our purpose. Real food is 
prepared with care, and providing safe, high-quality food is a 
key part of the culture at Campbell and essential to maintaining 
trust with our customers and consumers.  
We continue to improve the consumer experience. Over the last 
five years, overall consumer complaints have been reduced by 
16.4 percent, driven by our cross-functional focus on continuous 
improvement, food safety and consumer satisfaction. In FY2019, 
we also reorganized our Customer Care team under the Quality 
team to bring the two functions closer together and improve 
collaboration and data analysis. This change increased our focus 
on consumer engagement across all channels, including social 
media, chat, web inquiries and phone calls. As part of the same 
team, it will be easier to share information, increase visibility 
and examine root causes to improve our ability to respond to 
consumer concerns.
In our operations, we continue to focus on integration,  
standardization and continuous improvement. Our internal 
subject matter experts in sanitation, process safety, microbiology, 
toxicology and chemistry are constantly working to improve  
our programs. In FY2019, we continued to integrate our new 
acquisitions into our food safety and quality standards and 
processes. To further elevate our food safety performance, we 
consolidated our Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) certification 
for all internal manufacturing facilities under NSF International, 
which is known for its rigorous standards. This move further raises 
the bar on our commitment to food safety and quality compliance.
We also rely heavily on our ingredient and packaging suppliers 
to fulfill our commitment to food safety and quality, as well as to 
deliver on the promise of our purpose, Real food that matters for life’s moments. To accomplish this, it is important that our 
suppliers share our same objective: to ensure consistently safe, 
quality products that meet or exceed our customer and 
consumer expectations. In order to ensure our suppliers  
are meeting these expectations, we have a robust supplier 
auditing program and, in FY2019, increased the number of 
audits conducted by nearly 6 percent over FY2018.
Campbell’s supplier requirements have been developed from 
internal and external food safety and quality standards, regula-
tory requirements, benchmarking with other food company 
programs, reviews of supplier performance, and critical issues 
for the food industry. Taking steps to support these programs 
ultimately helps prevent product recalls and consumer complaints, 
as well as driving continuous improvement throughout the 
supply chain for us and our suppliers. 
STRENGTHENING FOOD SAFETY  
THROUGH SUPPL Y CHAIN ENGAGEMENTPRODUCED // STORIES OF PROGRESS
Small improvements can add up if done right. For our Napoleon, 
Ohio, plant, which makes Campbell’s soups, V8  beverages and 
Prego sauces, several small initiatives identified by the team led 
to a 13 percent reduction in water use in FY2019, compared to 
a baseline of FY2017. The annual savings: $158,000. The team’s 
efforts included:
• Identifying and systematically optimizing all water lines 
going to the cookers• Closing an automatic valve in the chiller room, which was 
not sealed properly and was allowing water to pass through 
• Using tracers to identify problems, allowing for quicker and 
better identification of leaks and other issues 
A combination of system improvements, behavior change and 
engaged employees play a key role in achieving these savings 
at Napoleon and other plants.ENGAGED EMPLOYEES DRIVE WATER SAVINGS IN 
NAPOLEON, OHIO 
38Maxton, North Carolina and Napoleon, Ohio
Our Maxton plant team focused on reducing their energy use by innovating on how 
they could use waste heat produced during food processing instead of expelling it 
into the air through cooling towers. The team introduced a heat recovery process 
to capture the heat and return it to the boiler house for reuse. The heat is now 
captured at the front end and used in the plant’s hot water system, resulting in 
annual savings of $350,000. We also cut our lighting electricity use in half by 
converting both the Maxton, North Carolina, and Napoleon, Ohio, plants to LED 
lighting. This update will reduce GHG emissions by 7,500 tonnes and save us 
$950,000 annually.
Charlotte, North Carolina
Innovation can come in the smallest of ways – and when the energy management 
program is owned and led by employees, it can have tremendous results. For instance, an employee  
in our Lance crackers facility in Charlotte noticed that uncovered belts were running, even when the  
cracker product wasn’t. The problem was quickly fixed, extending the life of the belts and reducing the 
costs and energy needed to run the belts. Similarly, upgrading the combustion fan on one of our saltine 
cracker ovens led to unexpected savings. An old combustion fan was requiring the team to run heavier 
crackers to prevent breakage. The new combustion fan allows better control of heat during the baking 
process and helps prevent breakage, thereby allowing for a lighter-weight cracker. The result: a reduction  
in the amount of dough needed to make the crackers, a lighter cracker and $250,000 in annual savings.
Stockton, California
We continued to focus on water efficiency at our tomato processing plant in Stockton, California. The tomatoes 
processed here are used to make V8  beverages, Campbell’s soups, Pace salsas, and Prego sauces. In 
FY2019, we accomplished significant water savings, reducing consumption by 29 percent through several 
innovative methods, including:
• Recycling the water evaporated out of the tomatoes when we make paste to offset freshwater  
use in cleaning various equipment in the plant;
• Using recirculated water instead of fresh water, to move tomatoes throughout the plant; and
• Raising general awareness and daily feedback to and from employees on how to limit wasteful  
uses of water.
 
Pepperidge Farm Bakeries
We completed converting all remaining heating and cooling systems across our Pepperidge Farm facilities 
from R22 to natural refrigerants ahead of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2020 deadline. R22 
has been declared an ozone-depleting substance in the Montreal Protocol, and the switch to ammonia and 
CO 2, which are natural refrigerants, will result in reduced energy consumption and GHG emissions.SMART INNOVATIONS LEAD TO SAVINGS

TACKLING FOOD WASTE IN OUR OPERATIONS
The United States generates roughly 60 million tons of food waste annually, and nearly 40 million 
tons of that goes to landfill. About 25 to 40 percent of the food that is grown, processed and 
transported in the United States will never be consumed, making eliminating food waste a core 
priority for us. Here's how we're doing it:OUR GOAL:
TO REDUCE WASTE TO LANDFILL BY  
25 PERCENT BY 2025 AND REDUCE FOOD 
WASTE BY 50 PERCENT BY 2030, IN LINE 
WITH UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT GOAL 12.3.
SOURCE REDUCTION  
AND REUSE: At our  
Lakeland, Florida, bakery, 
bread that would otherwise 
go to waste is sold to 
another company to make 
breadcrumbs.
COMPOSTING: At our headquarters in Camden, New 
Jersey, we send food waste from our cafeteria to compost, 
and at our Stockton, California, plant, a third-party composts 
vines and damaged fruit from tomato processing.FEED ANIMALS: Many of our plants send 
food byproducts that would otherwise go  
to waste to feed animals. This is the largest 
category of food waste diversion for our 
company. Potato waste from our Salem, 
Oregon, chip plant for instance, goes to a 
local dairy to feed their cows. And pomace 
from the fresh vegetables that we process  
at our Napoleon, Ohio, plant to make V8  
beverages is made into pet food.FEED HUNGRY PEOPLE:  
In FY2019, Campbell donated 
product in the amount of  
$59.9 million to support the 
local communities where  
we operate.
LANDFILL:  The remaining portion of food waste is sent 
to incineration or landfill. We have a goal to reduce 
waste to landfill by 25 percent by 2025 and aim to 
reduce food waste by 50 percent by 2030, in line with 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12.3. 
In FY2019, we reduced waste to landfill by two percent 
and food waste by 36 percent.ANAEROBIC DIGESTION AND WASTE OILS:  
At our Napoleon, Ohio, plant, where we make 
soups, sauces and beverages, we send 
product that does not meet quality stan-
dards or is expired to anaerobic digestion. 
The packaging is removed and recycled, 
while the food waste is used to create 
energy. At our chip plant in Salem, Oregon, 
waste food oil is recycled into biofuels.Least PreferredMost Preferred40

EMPLOYEES41At Campbell, our purpose extends to how we maintain a culture of transparency, 
integrity, innovation and care. Our people are our most important resources and 
join the Campbell team because they see their values reciprocated and respected. 
Our rich legacy is a keen attraction for talent and one that we take immense pride 
in celebrating and encouraging. 
As we’ve welcomed new brands into our family over 
the last few years, we’ve also spent time reevaluating 
our approach to employee engagement, inclusion 
and diversity, training and development, and continu-
ous improvement. 
Our new CEO Mark Clouse signed the CEO Action for 
Diversity & Inclusion and is committed to enabling 
more inclusive workplaces. In the last year, we began 
embedding inclusion and diversity professionals 
within our operating divisions – Snacks and Meals & 
Beverages – to ensure more focused objectives, 
programming and engagement. We are in the process 
of evaluating our recruitment process for areas where 
we can change the minimum requirements for posi-
tions, which will encourage more diverse candidates to apply. We also adjusted 
the types of questions we ask in interviews to make sure we are bringing people 
in who reflect our values.
 
Our Human Resources team launched three new training and development 
programs this past year to support our efforts to build a winning team and 
culture: perform to WIN, manage to WIN and include to WIN to equip current 
employees with the tools they need to thrive at Campbell. And we remained 
focused on employee safety with training and development across our facili-
ties, achieving a 14 percent decrease in incident rates as a result in FY2019.
We continued to advance our digital efforts, recognizing our employees’ preference for digital 
communications. Workplace by Facebook, which was launched in 2017, continues to grow in popu-
larity, supported by employee-led resource groups, work chats, polls, events and shared photos. 
These not only have led to more engaged employees across our network, but also to a renewed 
sense of togetherness and pride. 
Finally, we conducted a number of celebrations across our facilities to engage our employees in the 
celebration of our 150th anniversary. Take a look at some of the fun we had at these events that 
honored our heritage and recognized our employees who have been instrumental in our legacy!WORKPLACE BY

GOAL:  
Achieve 3% decrease in reportable and 
lost time incidents per year with long-
term goal of 0 incidents43“Safety first.” It’s a common refrain, and for good reason. Safety 
at our facilities is paramount and is a foundational expectation 
of doing business. We’re continually looking for ways to reduce 
incidents, and over the past year, elevated our safety focus 
even further. Knowing that times of change can sometimes 
bring increased injury rates, we’re taking the opportunity to 
create standardized, proactive processes across Campbell that 
will help everyone stay safe every day. 
We partnered with CorpU, a provider of learning and development 
programs, to roll out our new standards to approximately  
500 facility employees, including emerging leaders, middle-  
level managers, and senior leaders. The program includes the 
following elements: 
•  New Leadership and Associate Expectations – We’re setting 
new expectations for leaders to have daily conversations with 
their teams about safety. A set of critical safety rules can be 
used to focus these conversations. 
•  Change Management – We can’t make change without 
alignment. As we adopt new standards, we’re partnering 
with other business units and corporate functions to 
ensure all parties are aligned from safety, quality and 
environmental perspectives. 
•  Risk Management – Supported by senior leadership, we’re 
putting more guidance around how we manage risk. We’ll 
deliver this guidance to facility leaders through a combination 
of trainings and virtual touchpoints. 
•  Safety Observations and Behavior – Our goal is to transform  
our safety culture to one where peers look out for one another 
and safe behaviors become second nature. At the beginning 
of each meeting at our facilities, team members share any 
safety items that need to be addressed, and these are added 
to a short-term action board. Leaders follow up on short-term 
actions until all are completed. •  Accident Investigation and Root Cause Analysis – While we 
continue to strive for zero incidents, we use any incidents 
that do occur as opportunities to learn and improve. We’ve 
improved our data management so that we can better see 
patterns and respond quickly when incidents arise. 
As a result of these changes, Campbell achieved a 14 percent 
reduction in our Total Reportable Incident Rate and a 31 percent 
reduction in our Lost Time Incident Rate. Our Lakeland, Florida, 
facility went 365 days without a reportable incident. 
A NEW PATH FORWARD  
FOR SAFETY  SHARED: EMPLOYEES // STORIES OF PROGRESS
RAISING SAFETY TAGS
 
Our Campbell Snacks facility in Richmond, Utah, 
came up with a “safety tag” system to draw attention  
to potential safety risks. When an employee sees an 
issue that needs to be addressed, they grab a safety 
tag, write down the problem and hang it up for all to 
see. They also give a copy of the report to their 
supervisors. The tags remain out in the plant until 
they are addressed, serving as a visual reminder of 
actions that need to be taken to keep everyone safe. 
44As we transform our company, it’s more important than ever for us to help employees 
grow their skills and chart their career paths at Campbell. Our Talent Management 
team’s vision is to create real talent with the right capabilities to ignite our company’s 
growth. We’re doing this with several new programs designed for employees at 
varying levels of the company. These include: 
BUILDING THE SKILLS WE NEED TO WIN SHARED: EMPLOYEES // STORIES OF PROGRESS
perform to WIN uses an objective and 
key result (OKR) model through which 
employees set clear objectives aligned 
to our companies’ strategic priorities 
for the year. It’s designed to drive 
greater focus and alignment, improve 
our operating discipline, and increase 
accountability. In 2019, 98 percent  
of salaried employees logged their 
FY2020 OKRs in Campbell’s tracking 
system. In addition, three times per 
year, employees and managers meet 
for a check-in to help them see where 
they are succeeding and where they 
have room to improve, and at the end 
of the year, employees are recognized 
and rewarded for performance. We 
also launched an e-learning module, 
titled “Home Truths,” which provided 
guidance on how to navigate these 
manager check-ins, and more than 
900 employees registered.Managers need support to 
continually build their capabilities, 
too. manage to WIN is a program 
providing development opportuni-
ties for managers. The program 
includes a two-day in-person 
summit combined with virtual 
learning on performance coaching, 
delegation, inclusion and other 
topics, and provides a forum for 
managers across the enterprise  
to come together as a learning 
community and strengthen their 
capabilities together.include to WIN is a subset of our 
overall inclusion and diversity pro-
grams. It comprises online inclusion 
training that is available to all salaried 
employees and is mandatory for all 
managers. In FY2020, we will be 
launching two new trainings, “The  
In Crowd” and “Micro-messages.” 
45
Inclusion and diversity are crucial to building a winning culture 
– one that commits to listening to, learning from and understanding 
one another in every interaction. In 2019, we advanced our efforts 
to foster this winning culture by creating an Inclusion and Diversity 
Advisory Board. This board, which consists of 11 employees from 
across Campbell divisions and locations, will collaborate with the 
Talent Management team and advise our Campbell Leadership 
Team on what it believes is most important to our employees and 
where it thinks we should focus our inclusion and diversity efforts.
As a result of our business transformation, we reinforced our 
commitment to inclusion and diversity by embedding inclusion 
and diversity resources into Campbell’s two business divisions, as 
well as the enterprise function. This structure allows our business 
units to develop objectives and action items that align with their 
business needs. For example, after our Meals & Beverages Sales 
division began collaborating with the Network of Executive Women 
(NEW), our Campbell Snacks Sales division committed to support 
70 sales professionals in joining NEW to participate in webinars 
and other NEW-hosted events. We also sent several sales 
professionals, including our Sales Senior Vice President, to NEW’s 
annual business conference. Because of the broad appeal of this 
network and the value of its programming, we are positioning our 
affiliation with NEW to align with the other work of our Women 
of Campbell Employee Resource Group in Snacks. 
Employee resource groups continue to provide a way for 
employees to connect, develop and discuss important issues 
–  and they’ve been active for years. For example, the Maxton, 
North Carolina, location of the Black Resource Group reached 
its 10-year anniversary in 2019 and celebrated this milestone 
with a gala. We have 10 employee resource groups at Campbell: 
• Asian Network of Campbell (ANC)
• Black Resource Group (BRG)
• Bridge Network
• Campbell Administrative Professionals (CAPs)
• Latino Network
• Maxton American Indian Network (MAIN)
• Our Pride Employee Network (OPEN)• Roots
• Veterans Connection 
• Women of Campbell (WoC)
Among other engagement activities, some of our employee  
resource groups host professional development workshops 
and in 2019, the focus was on perform to WIN and writing strong 
objectives and key results (OKRs). Others, like the Asian Network, 
have worked with brands such as Kettle Brand and Swanson on 
refining their Asian-inspired product flavors, packaging design 
executions and marketing messages.
Empowering Young Women
In January 2019, Campbell hosted a career development event  
for the Women of Tomorrow Mentor and Scholarship Program 
of Greater Philadelphia. The organization’s mission is to “inspire, 
motivate and empower at-risk young women to live up to their  
full potential through a unique mentoring program with highly 
accomplished professional women and scholarship opportunities.”
The event was sponsored by our Black Resource Group (BRG) 
at our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, and featured a 
diversity awareness icebreaker and a career-pathing panel 
discussion, as well as presentations by BRG leaders and members. 
Approximately 50 students and program managers attended. The 
event happened to coincide with the first day at work of our then 
new CEO Mark Clouse, who graciously treated the participants 
to a visit and photo op. Finally, the company recognized the 
volunteer hours our employees spent organizing this event through 
our Dollars for Doers program and made a corresponding donation 
to the organization.MAKING DIVERSITY

WOMEN ON BOARD 
 
We’ve long been committed to having women represented 
on Campbell’s Board of Directors. When Campbell 
acquired Pepperidge Farm in 1961, founder Margaret 
Rudkin became the first woman to serve on Campbell’s 
Board. In 2019, three leading organizations – the Executive 
Women of New Jersey, the Forum of Executive Women 
and the Women’s Forum of New York – honored Campbell 
for having four directors who are women, representing 
33 percent of Board members.46

CONSUMERS47From our humble beginnings canning whole, fresh tomatoes for use throughout 
the winter, to the multitude of products we make today, Campbell has spent the 
last 150 years providing multiple generations of American families with hearty and 
healthy food options. Our purpose – Real food that matters for life’s moments –  
holds true despite the many changes we’ve seen across diets, lifestyles and 
expectations from consumers over those years. 
Our Real Food Philosophy, which  
emphasizes transparency, consumer 
sentiments and expectations, as well as 
food prepared sustainably and with care, 
guides our work to develop new products 
and innovate existing ones. This Philosophy 
ensures we are giving people real food 
that they can enjoy, trust and afford, and 
that meet their health and well-being goals. 
As consumers continue to show more 
interest in plant-based options, more 
natural ingredients and clean labels,  
we work hard to keep our research  
and development efforts in line with  
our Philosophy and these changing 
consumer demands.
For instance, with the Well Yes! line of sipping soups, we are changing how millennials view and 
consume soup. They want convenience, great taste and purposefully chosen, nutritious and 
recognizable ingredients. And it has been a success for us because we’ve married doing the right 
thing with what consumers want. This has required agility, a keen sense of what’s ahead, build-
ing close relationships with our suppliers and always ensuring that our Real Food Philosophy is a 
driving factor in our decision-making.
We also worked with our panel of scientific advisors, made up of respected food and nutrition 
scientists from leading universities and private organizations, to build more transparency around 
our stance on sensitive issues. We know that transparency is important to our consumers and 
other stakeholders, and in FY2019, we finalized and published our first corporate position paper 
on sodium.
As tastes and diets continue to evolve, we will continue to keep our eyes set on what our consumers 
want and what we believe is the right way forward for accessible and nutritious food. Just as we led 
the food industry in our commitment to voluntarily label genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in 
our food, we remain committed to stakeholder transparency into the future so that our consumers 
can make the best decisions for themselves and their families. FRUITS & VEGGIES –

Campbell is committed to meeting consumers’ needs. We’re responding to demands for convenient 
foods that fit into a variety of lifestyles, from a desire for more plant-based ingredients to a preference 
for on-the-go options. Check out some of our recent innovations: 
Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse  
Hearty White 
We developed a new recipe and packaging for 
our top-selling Farmhouse bread. Hearty White 
has thick slices and fresh-from-the-oven taste, 
plus no colors or flavors from artificial sources 
and no high fructose corn syrup. 
V8 +HYDRATE 
One of Campbell’s nutrition scientists discovered 
that a blend of sweet potato juice and water is 
an ideal mixture for quick rehydration and from 
this, the idea for V8 +Hydrate was born. We 
paired sweet potato juice with hints of fruit in four 
delicious flavors: Strawberry Cucumber, Coconut 
Watermelon, Orange Grapefruit and Blueberry 
Acai for a refreshing way to rehydrate.
Well Yes! Sipping Soups
Soups are a great way to get your 
veggies – but they’re not always easy to 
eat on the go. Our sipping soups provide 
20 percent or more of a person’s daily 
vegetable needs in a microwaveable  
cup that can be sipped anywhere. 
Pacific Foods Bone Broths
Simple, clean ingredients like organic chicken, turkey 
or beef bones are slow simmered with vegetables, 
herbs and just a touch of apple cider vinegar. The 
result is a hearty bone broth full of naturally occurring 
collagen protein, which can be sipped by the cup or 
added to your favorite recipe. Pacific Foods Barista Series  
Plant-Based Beverages
The first branded line of plant-based 
beverages specially crafted to pair with 
coffee, Barista Series oat, almond, coconut, 
rice and soy beverages use the highest-quality 
ingredients to deliver great texture and taste.
Prego Sensitive Recipe
This traditional tomato sauce makes delicious 
Italian meals possible even for those who are 
avoiding onions and garlic. It’s also suitable for 
those following a low-FODMAP diet. Best of 
all, it’s priced right in line with the rest of our 
Prego portfolio. 
Plum Organics Mighty Protein  
& Fiber Pouches 
This line of toddler pouches delivers plant-
based protein from veggies, seeds and fruit. 
Each pouch provides at least 2 grams of 
fiber per serving, 200 mg of omega-3 ALA 
from chia seeds and is certified organic 
with no genetically modified ingredients.

50The V8  brand introduced its newest plant-powered beverage, 
V8 +Hydrate. Our new plant-based hydration beverage uses 
the goodness of sweet potato juice to provide consumers with 
naturally occurring electrolytes and glucose that aid in hydra-
tion and replenishment. With only 45 calories in each 8-oz can, 
V8 +Hydrate has one full serving of vegetables, no artificial 
sweeteners, is non-GMO, gluten free and vegan friendly.  
V8 +Hydrate brings consumers what they want: great taste, 
natural electrolytes and functionality – all at an accessible price

for Hangover Research” to show the rehydrating power of  
V8 +Hydrate. Check out Dr. Ken's research here .

Food Marketing Institute (FMI): As a 
member of the Food Marketing Institute, we 
connect and collaborate with our customers 
on major industry initiatives, including health 
and wellness. As one example, our nutrition 
team sits on FMI’s Health & Well-being Council with other 
consumer products goods companies and customer 
members to promote retail health and wellness programs. 
One important initiative that this group leads is Family 
Meals Month from the FMI Foundation. This month-long 
celebration and awareness campaign encourages 
families to commit to eating more meals together. We 
support this initiative through customer partnerships, 
health professional communications, social and digital 
campaigns, and more. 
Produce for Better Health Foundation: 
Last year, we sponsored a session at the 
Produce for Better Health Foundation’s 
annual Consumer Connection Conference 
with our Director of Sustainable Agriculture 
leading the session and educating attendees about the 
overlap between nutrition and sustainability. We also 
discussed what they can do to promote healthy and 
sustainable eating patterns and shared what the industry 
is doing to address sustainability issues. This session 
provided continuing education for the health professionals 
and helped to better inform their communications about 
sustainability and nutrition.
SHARED: CONSUMERS // STORIES OF PROGRESS51Campbell is a proud partner of the Whole Grains Council, which 
is committed to increasing consumption of whole grains for 
better health. The Council does this through consumer educa-
tion resources, media engagement and their Whole Grain Stamp 
program. To receive a stamp, each product goes through 
third-party validation from the Whole Grains Council to confirm 
that each serving of the product is at least 50 percent whole 
grain. Over 75 of our products currently carry this stamp, 
including our Late July chips, Pepperidge Farm Whole Grain 
breads, Lance sandwich crackers and more. In FY2019, we 
delivered over 1.5 billion servings1 of whole grains through 
Pepperidge Farm and Campbell brands.
At the same time, we also offer products that meet the needs of 
people adhering to a gluten-free diet. Our Kettle Brand chips 
and Emerald nuts are 100-percent-certified gluten-free, and 
brands like Snyder’s of Hanover and Late July provide gluten- 
free versions of their products. For several years, Snyder’s of Hanover and Lance have 
made donations to support 
the Celiac Disease Founda-
tion’s mission. Our Meals & 
Beverages portfolio also 
provides gluten-free options 
for select products from 
Pace, Prego, Swanson and 
V8. In FY2019 alone, we 
sold over $2.5 billion in 
gluten-free snacks, bever-
ages, broths and sauces.
1 This data does not include our newly-acquired 
Snyder's-Lance brands. As a result, the number of 
servings of whole grains is underreported here. 
We are working to integrate our acquisitions into 
our data tracking systems to improve our data 
accuracy in the future.GRAIN OPTIONS THAT FIT CONSUMERS’ NEEDS 
In 2018, we identified the opportunity to share best practices across Campbell's 
brands that are marketing natural and organic products. As a result, we created 
a cross-functional task force that allowed brands to share learnings on topics 
including labeling, nutrition, supply chain transparency and more. The Organic-  
Natural Task Force (ONTF) functioned across brands to enhance awareness 
around the organic-natural consumer base and the unique marketing, 
innovation and supply chain opportunities that they provide. Through the 
ONTF, we fueled our collective growth through collaboration and in 2019, 
we also created a governance council to ensure ongoing engagement 
between Task Force members. This council enables content development 
for shareability, the championing of initiatives as identified and acts as liaisons 
between the Task Force and various functions.We believe in telling our consumers what is in our products so 
they can make informed choices about the foods they enjoy. 
This is why we are committed to transparency – providing 
information about our products on packaging and online to help 
consumers make food choices that meet their needs and the 
needs of their family. And we ensure that 100 percent of our 
products provide nutrition information on packaging globally.
 
Our multidisciplinary team of experts follows a rigorous multistep 
review process to ensure any claims we make for our products 
are truthful and not misleading to consumers. In addition to an 
extensive internal review process, regulatory agencies enforce 
compliance in our operating markets. At a minimum, we label for energy (calories), total fat, saturated fat, sodium, carbohydrates 
and protein. Most products also include a percentage of recom-
mended daily intakes for nutrients per serving.
 
We participate in front-of-pack labeling systems mandated by 
regulations throughout Central and South American markets. 
We also participate in voluntary front-of-pack labeling programs 
throughout other regions as determined by individual businesses. 
 
For consumers who want more information about our food, 
beyond what we can fit on product packaging, additional 
information about ingredients, nutrition and claims is available 
online on individual brand websites.

COMMUNITIES53Supporting and engaging with our communities is core to who we are at Campbell. 
It has been a part of our DNA from the beginning – starting with our founders – and 
has continued to drive our philanthropy today. Throughout our 150-year history, this 
legacy of giving has remained one of the critical ways in which we deliver on the 
promise of our purpose.
Our Giving That Matters community affairs programming is built around our mission to strengthen 
and empower healthy communities in our hometowns and enhance employees’ connections to 
both company and personal purpose. Through our direct grantmaking, including the Campbell 
Soup Foundation and signature Campbell’s Healthy Communities program, employee engagement 
initiatives, in-kind giving, disaster relief and more, we work to achieve this mission by focusing our 
philanthropy on three focus areas:
• Increasing healthy food access
• Encouraging healthy living
• Nurturing Campbell neighborhoods
We work to increase healthy food access by concentrating on driving 
long-term solutions and changes to food systems that result in better 
accessibility to fresh, healthy foods. We also understand that in order 
to change the food people eat, we need to encourage healthy living by 
providing access to nutrition education and active lifestyle programs. 
Finally, nurturing Campbell neighborhoods, by transforming the 
physical spaces where people live, learn and play, is a necessary 
foundation for building healthy communities wherever we are.
We believe that in order to build solutions to meet our communities’ 
most pressing social needs, we must engage in initiatives that are 
informed and championed by local residents to ensure their sustain-
ability. This, coupled with the passion and skills of our employees, our 
expertise as a food company and learnings from our signature Campbell’s Healthy Communities 
program, are helping inform what’s next for Campbell and our philanthropy.
We are excited to share five new FY2025 community goals to build on our strong foundation  
of giving and further expand our impact in a few key areas. 
1. Increase food access for 100,000 residents in Campbell communities. 
2.  Provide nutrition education to 50,000 people to encourage healthy living in Campbell 
communities. 
3. Invest $5 million to improve the school food environment for children.
4.  Engage 70 percent of Campbell employees in community-based activities. 
5.  Contribute 75,000 traditional and skills-based employee volunteer hours across Campbell’s 
footprint to increase the capacity of our community partners.OUR APPROACH

Campbell formalized five new community goals in 2019 to improve the quality of life in our hometowns:We consider our grants a success when they lead to sustainable 
change in our communities. Therefore, the core criteria we use 
to inform our grant decisions include:
• How the organization’s work leads to behavior change that 
can be sustained by beneficiaries even when they are no 
longer directly participating in a program
• How the organization leverages other dollars and partner-
ships to sustain their work
• How well they take advantage of the skills of our employ-
ees to multiply their impact
• How effectively they engage residents in their work and 
use resident input to inform programming 
• Whether or not they partner across sectors to create  
systemic change . 
While our grant programs take different forms and have 
different levels of geographic reach, breadth and depth, and 
different processes – these criteria apply across them and help 
us gauge whether we are having the impact that we seek.SHARED: COMMUNITIES // STORIES OF PROGRESS

56Campbell’s Healthy Communities
Our signature community affairs program, Campbell’s Healthy Communities, is a 10-year, $10 million 
commitment to measurably improve the health of young people in our hometown communities. 
Launched in 2011, Campbell’s Healthy Communities brings together an ecosystem of partners that 
work together and conduct mutually reinforcing activities, primarily in our headquarters of Camden, 
New Jersey. The work focuses on four areas that we believe make communities healthier: food 
access, nutrition education, physical activity and public will. Activities take place across a variety 
of settings, including schools, health care sites and food retailers.SHARED: COMMUNITIES // STORIES OF PROGRESS
Working Collaboratively in 
the School Environment
Our grantees’ collective work at 
our partner schools was a key 
highlight in FY2019. All our 
Campbell’s Healthy Communities 
organizations have worked 
collaboratively at KIPP Cooper 
Norcross Academy in Camden 
over the past five years, building school gardens, teaching 
nutrition education lessons, offering after-school physical 
activity programs, assisting with taste tests and food 
distributions, and transforming the food in the cafeteria. Big 
wins in 2019 include the launch and subsequent expansion 
of the salad bar in the cafeteria, an 80 percent increase in 
student engagement in cafeteria taste tests, and nutrition 
education in the classroom to complement the USDA Fresh 
Fruit and Vegetable Program. These programs are succeed-
ing because students have both access to healthy food and 
education about healthy food. HIGHLIGHT: HIGHLIGHT: 
Incorporating Student 
Voice with the Camden 
Youth Advisory Council
Another exciting component of 
our Campbell’s Healthy  
Communities program is our 
Camden Youth Advisory Council, 
a group of high school students 
who serve as advisors and 
thought partners to our work. For the past several years, 
the Council chose to focus its efforts on school food and 
the changes they want to see in their school cafeterias. The 
Council surveyed 120 classmates across five schools and 
compiled a comprehensive report outlining the areas of 
need, which they then presented to the head of food 
service and nutrition for the school district. This is a great 
example of young people using their voice to spur change 
and to make their schools into healthier communities.

Improving School Food
With our signature program, Campbell’s 
Healthy Communities, having just fin-
ished year eight of the 10-year initiative, 
we are beginning to look to the future, 
taking what we have learned from this 
program to launch our next initiative. In 
FY2019, the Campbell Soup Founda-
tion allocated strategic funds toward 
our long-term priority of improving food offerings in schools. 
Building from the success at our KIPP schools in Camden, we 
are planning to take this work to the next level. Through a 
combination of larger grants to national partners and smaller 
grants in support of local organizations working on the ground 
in districts, we are helping to create a school food environment 
in which all students have access to real, healthy food. 
In year one, we supported:
• FoodCorps service members who are placed in schools 
across several districts focusing on hands-on learning 
about healthy food, healthy school meals and creating a 
school-wide culture of health
• Wellness in the Schools’ efforts to rewrite school menus 
and train cafeteria staff to prepare fresh and healthy meals 
for kids
• Mini grants to improve equipment in cafeterias to make 
them conducive to healthy cooking and eating
Campbell Soup Foundation
FY2019 marked the launch of two new Foundation programs: the 
Healthy School Food program, which builds off the success of 
our work in schools through our signature program, Campbell’s 
Healthy Communities, and the Community Impact Grants program.
HEALTHY CORNER STORE INITIATIVE
 
The Healthy Corner Store Initiative remains a highlight of 
the Campbell’s Healthy Communities program. Corner 
stores are a significant source of food, particularly in 
underserved communities, but these stores do not always 
stock fresh, healthy food choices. With Campbell’s support, 
local nonprofit The Food Trust provides store owners 
with technical assistance and support to stock and market 
healthy foods. Starting with two stores in 2011, the initiative 
has grown to 44 stores (40 percent of all corner stores 
in Camden) that promote and sell healthy food, serving 
13 low-income neighborhoods. 
Beyond making fresh food more readily available, the 
Campbell’s Healthy Communities program makes it more 
affordable with “Heart Bucks,” coupons redeemable in 
participating corner stores for heart-healthy foods after 
participating in in-store nutrition lessons. For the past 
several years, 99 percent of distributed Heart Bucks have 
been redeemed. Additionally, this year, 83 percent of 
participating store owners who were surveyed reported 
an increase in sales of healthy food items.

Community Impact Grants
Our Community Impact Grants Program was created to expand 
the geographic reach of our funding and to engage more  
employees in our grantmaking process. Through this program, 
we rely on select employee nominators from across our Camp-
bell locations to nominate nonprofit organizations operating in 
their communities to apply for a grant. Nominators are trained 
to identify organizations whose work aligns with our communi-
ty affairs mission and focus areas and who meet the other crite-
ria Campbell considers when making grants. During FY2019, 
the first year of the program, we received 68 nominations, 
which our Foundation executive committee and Board of 
Trustees ultimately narrowed down to 31 recipients across  
15 Campbell locations. The grants ranged between $15,000 
and $25,000 and were unrestricted, allowing organizations  
to use funds to build capacity and support their organizations 
as they see fit. 
Examples of FY2019 Community Impact grantees include:
• Marion Polk Foodshare, whose mission is to end hunger in 
Salem, Oregon, and the surrounding county by addressing 
food insecurity through not only traditional food distribution 
programs, but also through a prescription veggie program, 
Meals on Wheels and nutrition education; 
• Victory Garden Initiative, whose focus is on helping people 
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, grow their own food, thereby 
creating a community-based, equitable, sustainable and 
nutritious food system; and
• The Northeast Texas Trail Coalition, who is working  
to “re-cycle” a rail banked corridor in Paris, Texas, into 
pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian trails to allow for  
safe exercise and transportation, including safe bike  
routes to school.RALLYING MORE FUNDING FOR CAMDEN
 
The BUILD Health Challenge, supported by Campbell, aims 
to help communities address the root causes of health 
disparities. Campbell funded workshops for community 
partners to attend which prepared them for the BUILD 
grant application process and taught them principles 
around upstream solutions and cross-sector collabora-
tion. The result was a winning application for Camden! 
The Roots to Prevention collaborative (spearheaded by 
Camden organization Parkside Business and Community 
in Partnership) will receive a $250,000 grant award from 
the BUILD Health Challenge (with a $250,000 match 
from local health care partner Virtua Hospital) to address 
upstream causes to chronic disease in families linked to 
a lack of healthy food access in Camden.
59We continued to evolve our 
Giving That Matters employee 
giving programs this past 
year. We recognize that 
employees want to support 
causes and charities that 
matter to them. That’s why our 
new programs are designed 
with choice at their core. 
Employees have $1,500 in 
matching available to them 
from day one of employment 
at Campbell and they can choose where to give. In addition to 
open giving, employees are empowered to create specialized 
“funds” – groupings of nonprofits by focus area – on our 
giving platform where they can invite others to support 
causes they care about. Employees can also give their time, 
and recipient nonprofits will benefit from $10 per eligible 
volunteer hour. In FY2019, Campbell employees donated  
more than 10,500 service hours across the United States.EMPOWERING EMPLOYEE GIVING THROUGH CHOICESHARED: COMMUNITIES // STORIES OF PROGRESS

For Pacific Foods, nourishment 
dictates everything: from 
products that are made from 
simple, carefully sourced 
ingredients to the team’s 
efforts to nourish the environ-
ment and communities. In 
2019, Pacific Foods formalized 
its community work under their 
Nourish Every Kid program with 
clear guidelines, partnership 
parameters and an outreach 
plan to ensure they were reach-
ing the most people with the 
most needs. 
For years, Pacific has run 
multiple donation initiatives, 
including its flagship effort: donating over 100,000 meals to 
local children every year in partnership with local food banks, 
elementary schools and donation centers. Nourish Every Kid 
builds on the insight that thousands of children in the brand’s 
very backyard – the Pacific Northwest – continue to dread 
weekends and school breaks because of the anxiety associated 
with where their meals might come from. In 2019, the team took 
their work a step further and developed a protein-rich food box containing enough food for about three days. 
They partnered with their paper supplier, 
International Paper, who donated the 
materials and designed a box in a size a 
child could carry or fit in a backpack. 
Pacific Foods employees continue to be 
involved in the initiative by participating in 
regularly held team building events to make  
the boxes and using paid time off to volunteer.
Nourish Every Kid supports 23 schools and other organizations, 
and the team is taking steps to formalize the program even 
more in coming years.  DONATIONS THAT NOURISH EVERY KID SHARED: COMMUNITIES // STORIES OF PROGRESS

Alliance, Plum Organics donates Super Smoothie  
product and supports product distribution costs to 
preschools across Colorado and on the South Dakota 
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Once delivered, the 
smoothies are placed in children’s backpacks to take 
home, providing a reliable source of nutrition that can  
help boost health and readiness to learn. OVER A 20-YEAR PARTNERSHIP

When disasters strike, we respond by coming together and 
supporting our colleagues in need. When Hurricane Florence 
made landfall in September 2018, it left the area surrounding 
our Maxton, North Carolina, facility inundated with flood waters. 
The homes of more than 70 employees were severely damaged. 
We immediately activated our Emergency Assistance Fund 
(EAF) to provide quick support to our employees who needed 
emergency food, water and shelter. A similar response was 
provided to several employees at our Campbell Snacks location 
in Columbus, Georgia, who were severely affected by the 
tornadoes that ripped through the area in March 2019.
Campbell prides itself on responding to natural disasters with 
a two-tiered approach beginning with food donations and 
financial support for immediate relief items such as mucking 
supplies, tarps, lights and emergency gear. After the initial wave of support has left these communities, we work with 
local and national partners to support the long-term recovery 
of these impacted regions. In 2019, Campbell provided 
support to the American Red Cross, Center for Disaster 
Philanthropy, CARE, Catholic Relief Services and Convoy of 
Hope for the recovery of regions impacted by Hurricanes 
Florence and Michael, tornadoes in Alabama and Georgia and 
the volcanic eruption in Guatemala.CARING FOR COMMUNITIES AFTER DISASTER

Rooted in the beliefs of our Founders, we have been making food 
that we are proud to serve in our own homes since 1869. The work 
we do every day is guided by our values, as we strive to fulfill the 
promise of our purpose, and deliver our corporate responsibility 
goals. Thank you for inviting us into your homes for these many 
years and for joining us on our journey to make delicious food that 
is rooted in goodness, prepared with care, and accessible to all.REAL FOOD THAT 
MATTERS FOR  
LIFE’S MOMENTS
6263GOVERNANCE
Campbell’s commitment to corporate responsibility is reflected in our purpose, Real food that matters 
for life’s moments. Because of this, our governance structure helps ensure that corporate responsibility 
is integrated into our business decisions. In FY2019, we continued to deepen this integration, moving 
the corporate responsibility and sustainability function into the business under supply chain. We also 
continued to link incentive compensation with sustainability progress for both our Chief Executive 
Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Supply Chain.
We continue to make transparency a priority, embedding it in 
our new strategic plan and expanding both what it means and its 
audience beyond consumers. The following principles will guide 
our decision-making, measurement, reporting, communication 
and engagement. We are committed to:
• Understanding the expectations of all stakeholders, 
including our employees, so that we can build trust;
• Engaging on the topics that matter most to our  
stakeholders and that impact society, the economy  
and the environment; and
• Providing communications that are always honest,  
timely, relevant and accessible.
Our governance structure reflects this priority with company- 
wide decision-making taking place at the Campbell Leadership 
Team (CLT) level, which is then integrated into our two divisions 
– Snacks and Meals & Beverages – by our division heads and 
supported by corporate responsibility and sustainability through 
the Strategic Planning Process. We also now have sustainability 
leads in each division responsible for ensuring sustainability is 
integrated into business strategies, plans and operations. In FY2019, we further evolved our Sustainability Steering 
Committee, sponsored by the Executive Vice President of 
Global Supply Chain, who is also a member of the CLT. Led by 
our Vice President of Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability, 
we included new members on the Steering Committee this past 
year to support our new divisional structure. The Steering 
Committee serves as the advisory body for the development 
and achievement of Campbell’s sustainability strategy and goals.
Together with Ernst & Young, we also organized a workshop 
with leaders across Campbell on how to integrate environmen-
tal, social and governance (ESG) risk factors into our existing 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. The Corporate 
Responsibility & Sustainability team worked in collaboration 
with the Audit team, which manages the ERM process, to design 
a four-hour educational session for colleagues from Legal, 
Procurement, Strategy, IT, Human Resources, Marketing, 
Operations, Sales, R&D, Quality, Nutrition, Regulatory and 
Government Affairs. Ernst & Young facilitated much of the 
session using the World Business Council on Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD) guidance and COSO framework for 
integrating ESG into ERM. This workshop is the first step on 
Campbell’s journey to more fully integrate ESG risk factors 
into our risk management processes across the company.64

Everything we do at Campbell reflects our strong foundation 
of ethical business practices. This foundation allows us to 
attract and retain talented people who share our values and 
reduces the potential for risk or reputational damage. We pride 
ourselves on having built an ethical company where employ-
ees are proud to work. Campbell’s corporate compliance and 
ethics program, Winning with Integrity, reflects our conviction 
that conducting business in compliance with the law and the 
highest standards of business ethics is essential to our success. 
As reflected in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, 
employees share responsibility for ensuring that the Winning 
with Integrity principles are fulfilled every day, through each 
and every action taken – whether in the marketplace, the 
workplace or the community.The Code outlines our company’s basic standards and 
expectations, highlights important policies and summarizes 
certain fundamental legal requirements that employees must 
follow. Employees receive a copy of the Code when they  
join Campbell and participate in training regularly. The most 
recently updated version was approved by the CEO and the 
Board of Directors, is available in multiple languages, and is 
posted on the company’s internal and external websites.
Campbell’s Legal Department is responsible for maintaining 
and administering the Winning with Integrity program. The Vice

Campbell has a long history of actively monitoring pesticide residues on 
incoming ingredients via our own internal chemical residue testing laboratory. 
Ingredients and suppliers are selected for sampling using a risk-based approach 
using internal and external data sources on likely residue risk to set sampling 
frequency. In tomato ingredients, Campbell’s number one ingredient type for 
our legacy brands, we have over a decade of requiring farmer compliance with 
Campbell pesticide requirements which are stricter than U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) and California EPA standards. Farmer pesticide 
application reports are monitored, and tomato farmers out of compliance with 
these requirements cannot harvest their fields for Campbell.
416-2 Incidents of non-compliance concerning the health 
and safety impacts of products and servicesIn FY2019, Campbell had no Class I or Class II recalls in North America and had 
one recall related to mislabeling of Arnott's Shapes and Cheds in the United 
Kingdom, which caused two allergens – mustard and celery – to be undeclared.
