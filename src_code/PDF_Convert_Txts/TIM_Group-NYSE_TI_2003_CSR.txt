7Financial data and value added“Telecom Italia Group proposes Sustainability as a business value, a tool for programming,
management and control”.
The dedicated awareness placed by the Group on satisfying those bearing legitimate interests
on which the Group depends and, at the same time, influences by its own activities, has beenconstantly renewed for the last seven years.
As from last year, the Annual Report has included the 2003 sustainability section, taking the place
of “Other information”, which the legislator now leaves to the discretion of the companies.
This section is divided according to the stakeholders affected by Sustainability: Customers,
Suppliers, Competitors, the State and Institutions, the Environment, the Community, HumanResources and Shareholders.
The section on Shareholders also contains information on Financial Communications, the
Safeguarding of Privacy and Corporate Governance.
The section is drawn up accordingly with Global Compact principles.
The simbol “ ” beside the text identifies the most relevant paragraphes.
2003 sustainability section 2…Since we were well aware that there could be no reliable, long-lasting growth without
integrity, a good reputation and trust, we took action to make our administrative decisionseven more transparent, to ensure that the interests of all our shareholders would berespected, and to establish a continuous, open dialogue with the financial community.With respect to corporate governance, we want to be at the top not only nationally but alsointernationally, so that every level of corporate operations will adopt the kind of conduct thatwill guarantee the utmost honesty and transparency. It is a continuous process: another stepforward was the decision, starting with the Board of Directors taking office in 2004, that the
board should have a majority of independent directors of the highest possible standing fromboth a personal and professional standpoint.In more general terms, we have stepped up our commitment to implement policies ofcorporate responsibility that aim to satisfy all the bearers of legitimate interest – customers,employees, suppliers, the public at large, future generations – by supporting the principles ofthe Global Compact, the key benchmark at world level launched in 2000 by the U.N.O. topromote respect for human rights and labor standards and the safeguarding of theenvironment. By making the Sustainability Program an integral part of the Industrial Plan,we have planned the measures needed to assure the ethical excellence of the whole Group…3CONTEXT >>

/L50123COMMITMENTS
15 “areas of interest” have been selected and will be monitored to see whether they have 
a positive or negative impact in terms of sustainability, in order to harmonize stakeholders’expectations and raise their level of satisfaction. Particular focus points in 2004 include customer satisfaction and quality of service. Planning activities have been set in motion toachieve these objectives.
A joint period of active testing is to be organized with the Bocconi University in Milan to assess
the Group’s non-financial performance (intangible assets). The aim is to assess the creation ofvalue generated by pursuing the aims of Sustainability.
This year will also see the start of a systematic campaign to emphasize the commitment made by

When it was defining and implementing the strategy and programs for Sustainability, Telecom
Italia Group used the guidelines proposed by the main bodies responsible for orienting andstandardizing Corporate Responsibility.
Since 2002, Telecom Italia has subscribed to the nine principles of the Global Compact, 
the key benchmark at world level launched in 2000 by the UN to promote the safeguarding of the environment and respect for human rights and labor standards in companies.
The model for monitoring and reporting on Sustainability is based on a multi-stakeholder analysis
approach and on a set of performance indicators (314). Telecom Italia Group bases its reporting on
the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), according to the principles of the GlobalCompact. These guidelines are intended to encourage harmonious reporting on economic,environmental and social issues (triple bottom line).
The indicators being monitored are consistent with the information required by the main rating
agencies (SAM for the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, EIRIS for the FTSE4Good and SIRI) foradmission to listing on the sustainability stock exchanges.
The Sustainability management system also takes into account the main international standards for
the various stakeholders:–ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 quality certification for systems for managing quality and the
environment, to ensure quality of service for customers and respect for the environment;
–
Social Accountability 8000 (SA8000), the aim of which is to encourage respect for human
rights and decent working conditions on the part of suppliers and sub-suppliers alike;
–London Benchmarking Group (LBG) guidelines for measuring investments in the Community;
–International Labour Organization (ILO) for respect for the fundamental rights of workers and
the Human Development Enterprise (HDE) index of proper labor and employment practices,also drawn up by the ILO, to measure performance with regard to Human Resources.
The Group’s Corporate Governance system is based on criteria of exactness and transparency 
and reflects the highest national and international standards, since protecting its shareholders is a top priority.
The Group not only observes the most common standards but monitors out the various stakeholders
involved and compares its own performance with that of the competition and the best practices of Sustainability. Constant monitoring of Corporate Responsibility and its management tools is also a top priority.

The “Trust Us - Survey of Corporate Sustainability Reporting” survey, conducted at the end of
2002 by UNEP (UN) included Telecom Italia, the only Italian company to be represented, amongthe 100 best companies in the world in terms of the quality of its reporting on Sustainability.
In 2003, the two main companies of the Group listed on the Stock Exchange, Telecom Italia and
TIM, were admitted to the main FTSE4Good Indexes (Global 100 and Europe 50), the GlobalEthibel Sustainability Index (ESI) and the ethical indexes of E.Capital Partners. Both weredeclared eligible and were classified as runners up in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. Inother words, they will automatically be able to fill the place in the index should any one of thecompanies in that specific sector “leave” during the course of 2004.
In November 2003, Telecom Italia received the Operational Excellence Award, awarded by the 
Tele Management Forum (an international, non-profit organization for promoting the ICT services
industry), for the development of its new broadband platform.
In the 2003 edition of “Best 100, the best companies to work for” organized by Skillpass
(a company specialized in training and selecting personnel, in which Sviluppo Italia and leadingItalian banks hold investments), Telecom Italia was rated as the most desirable company to workfor in Italy. Telecom Italia was “the company which won the highest number of votes from the
Italian public, who thus rewarded two years of innovative management and the dynamicperformance of the Group, bestowing a prestigious honor on the corporate brand of Telecom andthe values which it succeeds in conveying through its activities”.
In the sphere of the “Pubblicità per bene” award, Telecom Italia received a special mention as a
company which has distinguished itself in making an economic contribution for social purposesfor the “numerous initiatives geared to promoting, raising awareness of and supporting social and
cultural ends” achieved through Progetto Italia.

customer focus, pro-action and transparency of information among its primary corporate values.In 2003, Telecom Italia SpA introduced a parameter linked to customer satisfaction in the overallincentive system. In fact, alongside the profitability indicator (gross operating profit), a CustomerLoyalty indicator has be added that carries a weight of 30% on the profit bonus. The indicator isan average of customer satisfaction with regard to the offer of services, Customer RelationshipManagement (CRM) system, corporate image and technical quality.This change, which is highly innovative within the Italian industrial spectrum, shows the highpriority being given by Telecom Italia to the satisfaction expressed by the customer. It also shows that it regards this factor as being a fundamental prerequisite for the creation of value and the maintenance of its position as market leader.

Telecom Italia Group began collaborating with the main consumer associations in 1997, when it
signed the General Framework Agreement with the 11 main associations. Negotiations andmeetings continued in 2003 aimed at safeguarding customers’ rights, particularly throughmonitoring and improving the application of the Charters of Services and the GeneralSubscription Conditions.The aim of a meeting held between Telecom Italia top management and the nationalrepresentatives of the Consumer Associations at the Future Center in Venice, was to verify andconfirm the content of the General Framework Agreement, by analyzing the impact oftechnological development and TLC services and evaluating the main problems raised by theassociations.Within the framework of the Consumers’ Forum, which brought together Consumer Associations,companies and research institutions operating in the sphere of consumers’ rights, numerousresearch projects were launched. The projects, which will examine consumerism and the role ofthe associations, will be completed by mid-2004.The representatives of the Consumer Associations were involved in the review of the Charters ofServices, contracts and the Conciliation Regulations of the Group.
The Group’s commitment to the area of consumers’ rights was also expressed in the following
activities:–spreading information about the possibility of benefiting from special contractual conditions
destined for the categories of weaker customers;
–collaboration with the Italian Communications Authority (AGCOM) for services that must be
provided as part of the Universal Service and the adoption by the Agency of a procedure forreconciliation and arbitration between the operators and users of the services;
–development of a procedure to safeguard users from potential hoaxes played on the Internet
using services such as 709, including the free permanent disconnection of these services andthe freezing of the amounts involved in disputes.

Telecom Italia Group’s procurement policy is based on criteria of transparency and reciprocal
cooperation. Suppliers selection is based on the competition between “qualified” suppliers, whohave been admitted to a special Register of Vendors. At year-end 2003, the register containedapproximately 1,750 suppliers.
The Purchasing Function has been organized in a centralized way at Group level so that relationswith suppliers can be managed in a uniform way and with the aim of improving the efficiency ofthe procurement process. In order to ensure that competitive bids take place in full respect of thecriteria of objectivity, so that every supplier has the same opportunities, and with the aim ofstimulating competition among suppliers, on-line bidding is being encouraged. Among otherthings, this will enable suppliers to check on developments and to learn the final result of the bidsin real time.The Purchasing-Quality Function always asks the main suppliers to comment on the process ofevaluation and control adopted by the Telecom Italia Group. The aim of this is partly to identifyareas for improvement and partly to establish a constructive dialogue with suppliers which, at thesame time, is receptive to the requirements of the stakeholder.
/L50123NEW PROCEDURES
A new procedure has been adopted for the Qualification of suppliers for all the companies in the
Group. The parameters used to evaluate companies who apply to be included in the Telecom ItaliaGroup Register of Vendors have been updated, with the introduction of the criterion of ethicalsuitability. This move safeguards all the stakeholders to a higher degree and improves relationswith the actual suppliers in the medium/long-term.

In particular, suppliers are asked to respect the principles in the sphere of human rights, labor
and the environment contained in the “Global Compact”, promoted by the United NationsOrganization, to which the Ethical Code of Telecom Italia Group specifically refers.A new Group Vendor Rating procedure has been determined to evaluate all the technical,commercial and administrative aspects of purchases.Periodical monitoring takes place for each commodity category on an annual or six-monthly basis.
The main factors to be monitored through this process are:–the extent to which the production process meets technical specifications;
–respect of delivery terms;
–behavior with regard to commercial dealings;
–the efficiency of the administrative invoicing process;
–respect for the guidelines expressed in the qualification procedure, and for Sustainability
parameters.
Once the global vendor rating (IVR) indicator has been determined, the Vendor Rating process
then classifies the supplier. This classification makes it possible to scale the controls on the qualityof the supplies and ensures that the supplier will remain in the Register of Vendors permanently.Suppliers are systematically informed of the results of the Vendor Rating procedure, so that theyare aware of the Group’s “degree of satisfaction” with them and the positioning of theirevaluation compared to that of their competitors.Guidelines have been established for controlling the quality of incoming goods for all the Group’sBusiness Units and Corporate Functions, with the aim of creating synergies and rationalizing theentire process. Deeper controls are carried out in the case of new suppliers or those with a lowrating, whereas, in the case of suppliers who offer high enough guarantees of overall reliability,controls are delegated to a greater or lesser extent to the actual supplier, by means of a self-certification process (comaking report), which shifts the responsibility for checking suppliesupstream of the production process as much as possible.“Guidelines for monitoring suppliers and the drawing up of contracts regarding waste disposalmanagement” have also been established. The guidelines require special controls to ensure thatthe services commissioned are being carried out correctly and in full respect of the higheststandards governing waste management and disposal. The frequency with which controls arecarried out is established according to the size of individual suppliers and their sphere ofoperation. The results of these controls help to establish the Vendor Rating.
/L50123CONTROL
The quality rating of suppliers is monitored throughout the procurement process. It starts before
the contract is drawn up. First, suppliers are selected through the Qualification process. Next,supplies are verified and their quality rating is assessed, together with the overall performance ofthe suppliers, through the Vendor Rating process described above.Controls are generally carried out on a random sample basis, according to a specific risk assessmentmodel for the commodity category to which the supplier belongs. Further controls may be carriedout in the case of new suppliers or if particular problems have been encountered. The results of thecontrols, which in 2003 numbered more than 13,600, lead to the following action:–inclusion in/exclusion from the Register of Vendors listing the qualified suppliers of the TI Group;
–authorization (where appropriate) to sub-contract activities to third-party companies;
–overall assessment of the supplier with regard to specific commodity procurement categories
through the award of a Vendor Rating;
–acceptance or refusal of the supplies;
–possible contractual implications which, through the application of penalties, may lead to the
eventual termination of the contract.

During 2003, Telecom Italia Group continued its collaboration with the OLO (Other Licensed
Operators), ISP (Internet Service Providers) and other television licensees. In many cases, thelatter are also commercial partners or customers vis-à-vis the products and services offered bythe Group.A description of the main initiatives undertaken with competitors in 2003 is commented below.
Telecom Italia
In the experimental field of Digital TV , Telecom Italia participated, in collaboration with its
competitors, in conferences, seminars, study days and round tables on the main technical,economic and regulatory topics of the sector, particularly with reference to the development ofinnovative services. Telecom Italia Group, which has entered the Digital TV sector with the La7and MTV channels, is actively co-operating with other television companies and is continuingtesting of digital terrestrial television on its own sites.
Along with other operators of the wireline network, Telecom Italia has organized numerous
encounters with the aim of creating a framework agreement for the setting up and operation of asingle database containing all the numbers and other data required for identifying the subscribers offixed national telephone service carriers. The aim is to provide Italian consumers with an information
service based on one directory containing the names of all the subscribers to the fixed network.
The aim of the introduction of the ENUM (tElephone NUmber Mapping) protocol is to supply a
translation function between telephone numbers and Internet names. By using ENUM, it ispossible to turn the telephone number into a “universal name” associated with the customer,both for phone and voice/data services, using already-existing networks. Telecom Italia and otherItalian TLC operators have participated in the public consultation begun by the NationalRegulatory Agency, with the aim of evaluating the appropriateness of and interest in introducingthe protocol from the point of view of operators and the general public.
TIM
Under the aegis of the National Regulatory Agency, TIM signed an agreement with other mobile
telephone operators to create a database of mobile terminal identification codes (InternationalMobile Equipment Identity – IMEI). The database will enable stolen phones to be identifiedremotely and rendered unusable through connection to the CEIR (Central Equipment IdentityRegister), a centralized database set up by the GSM Association. In future, the agreement, whichshould become operational during the first half of 2004, will make it possible to integrate withsimilar systems existing in other European countries.

/L50123RELATIONSHIP WITH ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS
On a European level, relations with sector institutions were given a further boost with the aim of
sharing experiences in the field of the regulatory framework with other competing operators andcreating a truly competitive international context. Of the many initiatives, Telecom Italia supportsa market and investment strategy which is directed to the promotion of eEurope. This is an actionplan which aims to speed up the development of digital services in member states of the EU andestablish a series of measures which the countries involved must adopt in order to exploit theopportunities offered by information technologies.Along with the CEO of the leading European companies operating in the sphere oftelecommunications, Telecom Italia has organized a round table which will act as an interface withthe European Commission for deciding the future of the evolution of the Regulatory Framework.Periodically, meetings will be arranged to discuss the most important aspects of the regulations.
Numerous initiatives were continued at Community level within the context of the variousassociations, for example:–the Brussels Round Table, which, through a cycle of events organized during the year, intends to
outline the future development scenarios of the telecommunications market, particularly forbroadband services;
–ETNO (European Telecommunications Network Operators’ association), which is the largest
association in the sector on the Continent. Its aims include the development of a competitive,efficient European telecommunications market, through coordination between the variousoperators and dialogue with institutions. Telecom Italia is on the Executive Board and chairs theSustainability working group;
–ITU (International Telecommunications Union), which is part of the United Nations System and
aims to promote the development of the sector on an international level through cooperationbetween the public and private sectors.
Together with other operators in the sector, Telecom Italia Group participates in the activities of
the Fondazione Ugo Bordoni which conducts research work in the most advanced hi-tech spheresof the telecommunications sector. Projects include work on Internet security, digital cinema andtelevision, second-generation Internet, e-learning, radio systems with low environmental impact,new technologies for search engines and Internet access from wireless equipment. TelecomItalia’s annual contribution to Fondazione Bordoni are included in the calculation of thecontribution to the “Community” stakeholder according to the model of the LondonBenchmarking Group.
Work continued in the management of relations with associations and the coordination of
representation and lobbying activities with Confindustria and member associations. Initiatives atnational and local level, which, in some cases, are shared with competitors, consist in action andmeetings to promote business development and the safeguarding of corporate interests. Topicsinclude economics, standards, labour unions and labour.
/L50123REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
The regulatory framework of the telecommunications sector in Italy has been transformed with
the coming into force on September 16, 2003 of the new “Code of electronic communications”which, among other things, incorporated into the national regulatory framework the EC Directivesreferred to in the “‘99 Review” relating to electronic communications networks and services (the Directives on “Access”, “Authorization”, “Framework” and “Universal Service”).

41 The communityThe new regulations were issued on the basis of Law No. 166 dated August 1, 2002 which gave
the Government a mandate to implement the new directives, and to adopt a code of legal andregulatory measures regarding telecommunications. Furthermore, in accordance with a precisecriteria of the mandate, the law demanded the streamlining of administrative processes, and theexpress abrogation of outdated standards so that operators would have a picture of existing lawswhich is clear and easily accessible.
There follows a brief description of the standards adopted by the competent authorities in 2003:
x-DSL services
In Resolution No. 06/03/CIR of April 15, 2003, the Italian Communications Authority (AGCOM)
approved the new prices of Telecom Italia’s range of wholesale x-DSL services, that is, the
intermediate services which operators acquire from Telecom Italia in order to supply ADSL to thepublic, unless they have their own infrastructures or do not use unbundling. The new range ofservices includes price reductions for ADSL access, the introduction of longer time-scales forstarting to market new wholesale services, the specification of the factors used to define the priceof wholesale services based on the retail-minus principle, and the integration of an operators’Service Level Agreement with regard to the disconnection of services.
Interconnection and Local loop unbundling
In Resolution No. 02/03/CIR of February 27, 2003, the Italian Communications Authority approved
the rates for the Interconnection Reference Rate Plan (OIR) for 2002 which Telecom Italia will apply to competing operators for the use of its network, together with criteria for changing the
charges of the OIR starting in 2003 over the next four years (the so-called network cap).In Resolution No. 11/03/CIR of July 25, 2003, the Italian Communications Authority approvedTelecom Italia’s interconnection rates for the year 2003, published on April 11, 2003. The
resolution includes additions and changes, particularly regarding the application of the network-cap mechanism, introduced with Resolution 03/03/CIR, for the range of some interconnectionlines, and for co-sharing, local loop unbundling, partial lines and permanent virtual lines services.In Resolution No. 12/03/CIR of November 27, 2003, the Italian Communications Authorityestablished the criteria for calculating the surcharge applied by Telecom Italia to interconnectionservices for collecting calls originating from public telephone services.In Resolution No. 16/03/CIR of December 23, 2003, the Italian Communications Authorityannounced a public consultation concerning the approval of the interconnection rate plan for2004 announced by Telecom Italia on October 31, 2003.
Maximum costs of fixed-mobile calls
In Resolution No. 47/03/CONS of February 5, 2003, the Italian Communications Authority
approved the new maximum costs, with effect from June 1, 2003, for calls from a fixed phone to
a mobile phone. The new prices include a reduction of rates for termination and retention. Withregard to the latter component, the Italian Communications Authority has also ordered that itshould be included in the new basket of final services subjected to the price-cap mechanism.
National frequency plan for digital TV
In Resolution No. 15/03/CONS of January 29, 2003, the Italian Communications Authority approved
the new national plan to assign frequencies for television broadcasting using digital technology(PNAF-DVB), in a way similar to that established for frequencies using analog technology. Accordingto the plan, frequencies will be assigned for national and local networks on a regional basis. Thedecision to keep similar structures for the analog and digital plans will simplify the transition fromanalog to digital technology for the holders of the licenses that have been issued.
The above-mentioned plan was integrated, for local broadcasting, in Resolution 399/03/CONS ofNovember 12, 2003, in which the Italian Communications Authority approved the “National integrated
plan to assign frequencies for television broadcasting using land-based digital technology” (PNAF-DVB-T).

the maximum change (7.2%) that can be applied to charges for the range of vocal telephoneservices from Telecom Italia’s public telephone systems.
/L50123INTERBUSINESS SERVICES
As required by the Antitrust Authority, the accounting principles used to determine the economic
values for Interbusiness services are described below. These accounting principles have been
verified by the auditors ever since 1996.
In 2003, this examination was performed by Reconta Ernst & Young SpA.
•Revenues are stated at market prices for competitive services and at rates established by the
resolutions of the Italian Communications Authority for the services of leased lines andrecorded on the accrual basis. In the case of services provided that imply the use of dedicatedaccess lines by the final customer, the revenues also include the income from leasing such lines(valued on the basis of the rates defined in the related resolutions of the ItalianCommunications Authority), with the consequent recognition of the same amount in costs.
•
Direct costs
–labour costs represent the cost of personnel who worked to provide such services; the cost
includes salary and wages, social security costs, provisions for employee terminationindemnities and other sundry costs recorded on the basis of the number of persons in thededicated operating structures and using cost accounting standards;

41 The community–network utilization costs include the cost to use the regulated carrier services (direct
connections) and the cost to use the carrier products/services offered in a competitiveenvironment; they are therefore valued, respectively, using the rates established by the ItalianCommunications Authority resolutions and the rates applied to all third-party customers, thesame as that which occurs in the cost structure of other carriers in the sector;
–
other costs refer to direct costs (marketing, service connection, operating and maintenance,
etc.) and indirect costs (corporate structure costs supporting the operating lines) valuedusing cost accounting standards and applying specific allocation methods.
•
Depreciation of fixed assets directly employed in providing the services in question are
determined on the basis of the estimated useful life of the fixed assets of Telecom Italia.
The economic results of the interbusiness services are reported as follows:
2003 2002 Change
(thousands of euro) amount %
Revenues 62,822 70,157 (7,335) (10%)
Direct costs (46,856) (56,286) 9,430 (17%)

Labour costs (2,016) (2,871) 855 (30%)
Network utilization costs (38,548) (36,023) (2,525) 7%

Depreciation (16,731) (17,696) 965 (5%)
Operating loss (765) (3,825) 3,060 n.s.
The results for 2003 show an operating loss of euro 0.76 million compared to a loss of 
euro 3.8 million in 2002. Such result is due to the combined effect of the reduction in revenuesthat was more than offset by the reduction in costs. The impact on revenues (– 10%) is mainlyon account of a decline in customers who switched to alternative commercial offers. The reduction of resources absorbed by the service is due to a decreasing number of customersand, in some cases, a reduction in the unit cost; in total, therefore, costs decreased by 17%.Depreciation shows a reduction of 5%.

Telecom Italia Group maintains constant, transparent relations with the central national
institutions (Parliament and Government), with the aim of representing the Group’s position inareas of specific interest and monitoring the procedure of approval of the standards governingthose areas. Constant support is given to the competent institutions (Parliamentary commissions,the Ministry of Communications and other government departments) in preparing standards onissues of corporate interest.
/L50123INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
Telecom Italia plays a continuous, interactive role with the European Commission, the Council of
the European Union and the European Parliament with the aim of monitoring the activities whichhave a significant impact on the Group. Numerous meetings were held with the EuropeanCommission and the European Parliament to discuss and initiate various projects, for example:“Local Loop Unbundling”, “Partial lines”, “Recommendation on remedies”, “Intellectual PropertyRights (IPR)”, “eEurope”, the “2005 Action Plan”, “Regulatory policies in the broadband sector”,“TV without boundaries”, “Services of General Interest (SIG)” and “Unsolicited commercialcommunications (SPAM)”.The Group contributed to the publication of the “IX Implementation Report” by providinginformation and data, and also participated in debates organized by institutional organizationssuch as ERG (European Regulatory Group) and CoCom (Communication Committee) on topics ofstrategic importance, including the re-sale of customer access, leased lines, partial lines and theimplementation of the new regulatory framework.
/L50123NATIONAL LEGISLATION
The efforts of the Group are concentrated on the following legislation of key interest to the sector:
–Legislative Decree containing the Code of Electronic Communications, which, according to the
mandate ordered by Law No. 166/2002, contains the new legal and regulatory measures for thereorganization of the field of telecommunications. The Code also implements the EC directiveson TLC within the national regulatory framework, thus bringing it into line with its Europeancounterpart. The important factor about this legislative decree, considering that the previouslaw for the postal system and telecommunications dates from 1973, is that all the legislation onthis subject, following the express abrogation of outdated laws, was established in a single law.By improving the level of certainty of the laws and streamlining administrative processes, thenew framework hopes to give operators a clear and easily accessible picture of existing laws.
–Legislative Decree No. 196 of June 30, 2003, which introduced the Code protecting personal
information and also implements the EU Directive 2002/58/CE on the treatment of personalinformation and the protection of privacy. The measures contained in the Code becameeffective on January 1, 2004.
–Bill for reorganizing the television system, of interest to the Telecom Italia Group since it owns
channels such as La7 and MTV , and on account of the aspects of the bill relating to anti-trust rules.
–Legislative Decree No. 70/2003 which implements the EU Directive 2000/31/CE regulating 
e-commerce.
–Legislative Decree No. 196/2003 containing the “Code for protecting personal information”
which, in addition to incorporating the measures regulating data protection in a code,implements the EU Directive 2002/58/CE relating to the use of personal information and theprotection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.

The 2004 Finance Bill also confirmed thatthe grants would be awarded in 2004, the amounts being established in the Ministerial Decree ofDecember 30, 2003.
With reference to the audit records, it is noted that the number of Parliamentary
questions/interpellations addressed to the Group showed a stable trend, similar to that of the prior year.
The Group continued to monitor and intervene on the constitutional bill which will form the basis
for changing the second part of the Constitution. The Bill establishes a Federal Senate to which it
entrusts the examination of the fundamental principles in legislation covering the same subjectmatter, including the communications regulations, delegating power to issue laws on matters ofminor importance to the Regions.Telecom Italia is supporting a proposal to change the document currently under examination with
the aim of removing telecommunications regulations from the competence of the Federal Senate and the Regions and bringing them back within the sphere of competence of Parliament,to avoid an increase in the legislative activities of local authorities in matters of key interest tothe Group.
/L50123INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION
The Group concentrated on the following measures with regard to international legislation:
–“Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on environmental
liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage”: the proposal of the Environment Directorate-General was approved for a second reading at the EuropeanParliament, but full agreement has yet to be reached on the contents of the proposal. 
The adoption procedure is currently being followed through the ETNO Sustainability working group.
–“Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament -
Modernizing Company Law and Enhancing Corporate Governance in the European Union - APlan to Move Forward”: a public consultation is currently being held on this subject, conductedby the Directorate-General for the Internal Market, to which the ETNO Sustainability working
group contributed with a Reflection Document (RD182), suggested by the executive board.
–“Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum health
and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physicalagents (electromagnetic fields)”: the Task Force on Electro-magnetic Fields, created by theETNO Sustainability working group has drawn up a Reflection Document - RD171 - which hasalready been sent to the European Commission, with the collaboration of GSM Europe and theMobile Manufacturers Forum. The document on electromagnetic fields is directed at membersof the European Parliament and aims to emphasize the initiatives being taken by operatingcompanies to safeguard public health, the current status of scientific knowledge and theproblems linked to the implementation of 3G networks.
–“Draft proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing 
a framework for Eco-design of End Use Equipment”: The Directive proposal is still being worked out.

Respect for the environment, which is an integral part of Telecom Italia Group’s commitment in
adopting Sustainability as one of its prime values, is a specific stakeholder in the Group’s“Strategic Plan for Sustainability”.
/L50123ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Group identified four major areas for assessing its performance:
•waste management;
•water;
•energy consumption;
•emissions.
All the data reported below has been calculated by processing operating data that has been
appropriately reclassified with particular reference to the data required by the law.
The basic data used for determining corporate performance has been inserted by the reference
person of the Business Units through a special, uniform computerized procedure used by all thesubsidiaries in the Group.
When analyzing the data relating to 2003, it should be borne in mind that the scope considered in
gathering the data has increased compared to the previous year, and that, at that time, the basic
data was collected and evaluated using methods that had not yet been systematically organized atGroup level.
The tables relating to the aggregate of Telecom Italia SpA include a column showing the percentage
pertaining to the Wireline Business Unit compared to the complete scope of Telecom Italia SpA.
As a result, the automated system for collecting basic data relating to Sustainability is now an
integral part of the overall traditional system of data-collection used by the Planning and ControlDepartment for economic and financial accounting purposes.
/L50123WASTE MANAGEMENT
The data relating to waste management shown below is stated in kilograms and refers to the
quantity of waste, for the most part recorded in accordance with the law.
The law clearly states that the data recorded in the waste management registers which must be
presented to the relative institutions may be changed within 3 months of the waste being sent tothe waste treatment and disposal plant, so that it may be updated with the real weight measuredat the disposal plant.2003 sustainability section 273CONTEXT

Eco-recovery of wooden telephone poles
Around 8 million wooden poles are used to support overhead lines. To make them last longer, 
they are treated with toxic preserving substances such as copper salts, chromium and arsenic (CCA).
With the passing of time, the poles impregnated with these substances tend to release some of
these substances which then infiltrate water, soil and sediments.Total quantity of wasteTotal quantity of waste collected for

If the wood impregnated with these substances is used as fuel, dioxins are released into the
atmosphere.
–Between 1993-1996, in collaboration with the “La Sapienza” University in Rome, Telecom Italia
Group undertook a research project to investigate the pollution potential of the woodentelephone poles impregnated with the above-mentioned substances. The results of the researchand the soil samples taken in the field showed that environmental pollution is restricted to apiece of ground with a radius of about 20 cm around the bottom of the pole. No evidence wasfound of water tables being affected, a factor probably due to microbic absorption and the low
level of solubility of the substances used.
–On May 27, 2003, Telecom Italia, the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Production
Activities, the Conference of State and the Regions and recycling companies signed anagreement for a program to prevent the production of waste deriving from the management ofwooden telephone poles. The impregnated poles are regarded as dangerous waste.
In this context, Telecom Italia, as owner of the poles, undertakes:-to carry out a structured analysis with the aim of re-using the poles for other purposes that
are compatible with the safeguarding of the environment;
-to gradually replace 200,000 degraded poles a year with others that are not dangerous for
the local habitat;
-to step up maintenance to prevent its activities from having a negative impact on the
environment.
Recovery companies have undertaken to find another use for the recovered material for activities
which will not have a negative impact on the environment and, together with transport andnetwork companies, to respect a series of conditions in terms of stockpiling and transport.The Ministries of the Environment and Production Activities will have to promote research toencourage the use of non-dangerous substances for treating wood.The Regions will ensure that the treated poles are re-used for work and projects within theirsphere of competence.Furthermore, a Vigilance and Control Committee made up of representatives of the varioussignatories of the agreement, together with representatives from the National Observatory onWaste, APAT and the High Institute of Health, will monitor the implementation of the agreement
and examine and propose any adaptations which may prove necessary.

Atmospheric emissions
Emissions may be in gas, liquid or solid form.
The emissions of certain substances into the air pollute the atmosphere, while the emissions of
other substances contribute to global warming.
As far as the industrial operations of Telecom Italia Group are concerned, the most typical and
significant emissions in terms of quantity belong to the second category, which includes carbondioxide (CO
2) from “indirect” emission, due to the purchase of energy from national suppliers
(Enel and other companies) and fuel consumption for heating and transportation purposes.
CO2is a typical product of combustion and, as such, is produced almost exclusively by thermo-
electric systems.
The quantity of emissions per amount of energy purchase has been estimated on the basis of
periodical controls of the amount and composition of geo-thermic steam used by power plants.2003 sustainability section 333CONTEXT

During the last year, despite the recovery of geo-thermic electricity production, reduction of
emissions continued, thanks to the adoption of abatement systems.
CO2emissions have been calculated according to the instructions contained in the guidelines
published by UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) and others recommended by ETNO(European Telecommunications Network Operators’ Association) within the framework of the“Climate Change” project.
The amount of CO
2produced by combustion is calculated by applying specific emission factors to
the consumption of the various fuels(1).
In 2003, the data relating to emissions produced by the use of electrical energy was taken from
the parameters published by Enel (2002 Environmental Report).
The data relating to emissions in 2002 have been re-calculated using the same parameters.

Telecom Italia SpA helped to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the emissions 
of carbon dioxide (CO 2) produced by the energy system of the Group (consumption of natural
resources to produce electricity, fuel for the corporate fleet and heating) by approximately 7%compared to 2002.
(1) The factors used in the past (for reasons of uniformity, using the criteria adopted at that time by the Ministry of the
Environment) were: 4.03 t of CO 2/tep for coal and derivatives; 3.27 for oil products; 2.35 for natural gas.
These factors were replaced with the ones recommended in the 1996 Guidelines published by the IPCC (International Panel on Clim ate
Change) for the national inventory of greenhouse gases and have already been used for the second national communication onemissions: fuel oil: 3.24 t of CO
2/tep; orimulsion: 3.38; diesel fuel: 3.10; natural gas: 2.35; coal: 4.02; lignite: 4.24; cokery gas: 2.00.
Each one of the above is then multiplied by a correcting co-efficient which takes into account the typical fraction of unburnt carbon
(solid fuel: 0.980; liquid fuel: 0.990; gas fuel: 0.995).
As in the past, the resulting figure regards burnt carbon – which, however, as just mentioned, is now assumed to be less than 100%

Electromagnetic emissions
Telecom Italia Group’s concern for the topic of electromagnetic emissions can be summarized in
the following commitments and action:
1. Absolute respect for existing laws in countries in which it operates(1).
2. Careful and scrupulous management of company installations throughout the whole life cycle,
and in compliance with latest additional internal efficiency and safety standards.
3. Use of, and constant search for, hi-tech technological tools for monitoring and investigating
activities(2).
Verification
In 2003, TIM controlled all its transmission systems, its new installations and the changes that
had been made to existing systems. The electromagnetic emissions of such systems weremeasured to ensure that they conform to current standards in the field of public health.
In most cases, TIM relies on external companies to carry out these measurements, whereas, in
others, it directly delegates the responsibility of measuring emissions to the territorialrepresentatives of the Ministry of the Environment and the ARPA (Regional Offices for theProtection of the Environment), especially when specific environmental situations are involved(regional laws, local regulations, and so on).
Even in the absence of any change to its installations, TIM carries out measurements of
electromagnetic emissions in agreement with the land-owners and/or towns or in compliancewith the UNI EN ISO 14001 or UNI EN ISO 9001 certifications, for the networks nationwidewhich have obtained certification.
The ARPA often carry out measurements ex post, the cost of which is charged to TIM, as laid
down by regional laws.
During 2003, 2,985 investigations were carried out for a total cost of euro 4,566,954.

The technology developed for measuring the carrier power output rating generated by a base
radio station will soon be integrated by a sensor which will allow direct measurement ofelectromagnetic pollution. This technology, which is being patented, should be moreeconomical and more efficient than solutions currently available.
(1) Italian law on the subject is particularly strict and the corporate process is structured on rigorous project engineering, si te
selection and plant installation management. In particular, every transmission mast is protected to create a restricted-accessarea (exclusion zone) where permitted exposure values could be exceeded.
(2) Specifically regarding GSM, a procedure for monitoring the fraction of power emitted with respect to the maximum rated
power, obtaining testing data from measurements on the connection between base radio stations and base radio stationcontrollers (BSC), is currently at an advanced stage of development.Subsequently it will be assessed whether to implement the application on a national scale.With regard to UMTS, definition of methodologies of analysis and simulation for estimation of radioelectric power in various
propagating environments and multimedia traffic contexts is in the process of refinement. The first results have already beenpresented at a number of international conferences.0100200300400500Emissions saved by

–APOGEO Project
The APOGEO (Antennas Procedures On Geographic Enhanced Orientation) procedure aims to
calculate radioelectric parameters relating to the three-dimensional positioning of TACS, GSMand UMTS transmitters.
The calculation is made using the geo-reference points of topographical features provided by
the GPS satellite system, the precision of which is increased by using the differentialcorrection technique provided by GEOTIM (network of permanent GPS reference stations).The application consists in positioning the “lobe of radiation” of a transmitter accurately,and, at the same time, verifying its electromagnetic compatibility.
Radioelectric parameters have to be measured accurately to optimize the mobile planning
process and reduce interference on TIM networks. Furthermore, the accuracy of the datameasured is considered essential for evaluating the exclusion zones (TIM can certify its owninstallation data by guaranteeing transparency and respect for current laws) with the aim ofrespecting and safeguarding the environment.
In 2003, 33 complete instrumentation kits were acquired for a total of euro 678,000.The kit consists of a GPS satellite receiver and an integrated laser for measuring
topographical features.
The use of this instrumentation according to the APOGEO operating procedure (a TIM patent)
aims to give the correct geographical reference points (latitude, longitude and height abovesea level) of the radio base stations and accurately measure the Tilt, the Azimuth and theheight of transmitters.
–STEREOSP
ACE Project
StereoSpace software makes it possible to visualise twin images, acquired digitally and
appropriately oriented (SV Master) stereoscopically on a computer screen, and to carry out
measurements, and make comparisons and updates, with the same precision as thatproduced using classic measuring tools.
StereoSpace contains digital images (stereophotomaps) of areas regarded as being of
strategic importance to TIM. These images are of key importance not only because they areaerial photographs with an adequate amount of resolution, but especially because they givekey geo-reference points. The tool makes it possible to identify the exact position of the
transmission installations, thus providing accurate data for frequency planning and forcalculating and seeing the exclusion zones on screen.
In 2003, digital stereo photomaps were acquired for 17 different areas for a total of euro
235,484.
With regard to the mobile phones marketed through its sales network, TIM makes a selection
based on the level of technical innovation and the measurements of the Standard AbsorptionRate (SAR) to guarantee reduced electromagnetic emissions levels.
In cooperation with a number of Italian universities and various national and international
organizations, Telecom Italia SpA promoted investigations to check the emission values ofelectromagnetic radiation and possible environmental effect. These investigations confirmedthat the values of the electromagnetic fields produced by the equipment managed by theTelecom Italia Group in Italy are within the statutory limits and that, according to current
knowledge, there are no associated risks at biological level.2003 sustainability section 373CONTEXT

/L50123ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
The industrial part of Telecom Italia SpA (Wireline - Network) designs, implements and manages
its production and support processes and ensures that they conform to existing legalrequirements. It also identifies action plans with a view to prevention and potential improvement,bearing in mind fundamental values, with the following specific environmental objectives:
•to optimize the use of energy sources, natural resources, materials and products;
•to improve waste management by making efforts to re-utilize and re-cycle materials used and
residues from processes;
•to minimize the negative impact and maximize those which, thanks to the dissemination of hi-
tech telecommunications services, have a positive impact on the environment;
•to adopt procurement policies which are sensitive to environmental problems, by involving
suppliers;
•to improve the indicators of effectiveness and efficiency relating to corporate processes.
The ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications are regarded as the main levers for ensuring that
corporate production processes give quality service to its customers and reflect the principles ofsustainable development.
To support this policy, an integrated system for Managing Quality and the Environment is being
developed and applied throughout the Group.
The impact of the company on the environment is identified, controlled and governed through
special management tools and the procedures of the Environmental Management System (EMS)are being implemented in every corporate sector. The aim is to extend these procedures graduallyto the whole Group, through a special project coordinated by the Corporate Function.
Some of the Environmental management Systems obtained certification from DNV (Det Norske
Veritas, an internationally accredited certification agency) in 2001 and, in 2003, the certification
project was completed for the UNI EN ISO 14001 standard of the Environmental ManagementSystem for the whole of Wireline. Since 2002, checks have been carried out by the CertificationEntity IMQ-CSQ on structures belonging to the Wireline Network nationwide, all of which yieldedpositive results.
When all the checks had been completed, all the certificates issued for individual structures
converged in a single ISO 14001 certificate, which is valid for the whole Network Function.
Numerous information tools are used for monitoring, reporting and auditing for the
Environmental Management System, including the following software applications:
•GAVI (Gestione Automatiche delle Verifiche Ispettive – Automatic Verification Management): this
system is devoted to the management of planning, work assignment, auditing reportmanagement and non-conformity of internal verifications;
•MOSE (MOnitoraggio Sistema Ecoambientale – Monitoring of the Eco-System and the
Environment): this system is devoted to collecting and analyzing environmental indicators;
•Hermes: a procedure for managing communications relating to environmental problems;
•ENEA (Elenco Norme Eco Ambientali – List of Eco-environmental standards): an electronic
archive of legislative measures that can be used by the Network Function for environmentalmatters.2003 sustainability section 383CONTEXT

Environmental Management System, developed in compliance with the UNI EN ISO 9001 and UNIEN ISO 14001 standards at the premises of the Network Function. The process will be completedduring 2004.
A plan has been launched to monitor the consumption of natural resources and energy (in keeping
with the development of the EMS), together with a plan to reduce the production of waste.In particular, this initiative aims to reduce the total number of lead accumulators being used.Organizations which have received certification have activated separate collections for paper andtoners. In addition, a communication program has been started involving all the employees,partly through the corporate Intranet, as well as local authorities and suppliers of the territorialorganizations concerned.
Initiatives have been launched to reduce the visible impact of base radio stations with the aim of
improving the integration of the installations on the territory.
TIM intends to publish information about its environmental management with the aim of
increasing its customers’ confidence and satisfaction, as well as that of the community at large. It intends also to promote its environmental policy amongst its suppliers and to develop arelationship of collaboration with the Public Administrations.

Telecom Italia Lab
The Wireline, Mobile, Internet and Media Business Units and the IT Group Function made a
significant financial contribution to scientific research conducted by Telecom Italia Lab. Researchincluded the following initiatives:
–development of the access network (given the growth in demand for band availability) and the
transport network (associated with the gradual transition towards optical technologies);
–development of phone services, with the aim of making the network architecture converge with
an “all-IP” model;
–development of the mobile phone network and hi-tech services of the third generation;
–the new frontiers of the Internet, multimedia and security.
CRSA (Control & Risk Self Assessment)
The aim of the project is to spread a tool for identifying, assessing and managing operational
risks that is integrated with the planning and control process at Group level. Another aim is tobring the Group in line with national and international best practices in the sphere of CorporateGovernance. The project is based on risk self-assessment on the part of the management, afterwhich the existing control system is examined and proposals are made for improving controls inthe future. The first phase of the project has already been completed.
A specific web-based application is being prepared to support the phases of risk assessment and
management and for implementing the proposed action plans.
Crisis Management Model
This is the main tool used for tackling risks which would have a major impact, but are very
unlikely to happen. The model is based on interaction with the Crisis Management Board, which isin charge of strategic coordination, and the Operational Crisis Teams (OCT), who are responsiblefor the operational and territorial management of the crisis. A Group “Policy of Crisis
Management” has been prepared, along with “Group Guidelines” and a number of “OperatingProcedures”, which differ according to the type of crisis involved. The most important aspects ofthe model are:
•the pro-active logic of crisis management;
•different types of OCT based on the characteristics of the various business units;
•the uniformity of the operating solutions, ensured by strategic co-ordination by the Crisis
Management Board.
Sistema Ci.Pro. (Civil Protection)
The aim of this project is to achieve optimum management of emergencies such as natural
disasters, catastrophes or other exceptional events. It relies on a database containing a completelist of all the leaders to contact if a crisis arises, and description of all the technical resources andvehicles available. The information is supported by maps which users can access to give warning
of any problems or emergencies that may have occurred, and by a detailed analysis of thepotential risk (seismic, hydro-geological, etc.) nationwide.
Sistema I.C.S. (International Contact System)
This is based on a procedure managed by special software, using travel documentation, enabling
users to keep up-to-date with the situation of their employees working abroad. In the case ofnatural calamities, terrorist attacks, or other disasters, the employees can immediately becontacted, report their status and make requests for help.2003 sustainability section 473CONTEXT

(and corresponding to one ordinary share for every option), but the number of shares of the new
Company corresponding to the ratio established for the shareholders of the two companies, equalto 0.471553 ordinary shares for each ex-Olivetti option and 3.300871 shares for each ex-TelecomItalia option.
The per unit subscription price of the ordinary shares coming from the exercise of the options
was thus changed for each Plan, dividing the exercise price already determined by the relativeexercise ratio.
In the cases where the application of this ratio to the various lots results in a fraction of a share
in the exchange, the holder of the options has the right to subscribe for each lot a whole numberof shares rounded down to the nearest unit, exercising only the corresponding quota-part of theoptions. Following the exercise of the options after the date of the merger, there were residualoptions for fractions of shares.On December 31, 2003, the period for exercising rights on the first lot of the Stock Option Plan 1999 expired. The lot was entirely exercised except for the residual options for fractions ofshares which arose as a result of the above, which, accordingly, on the same date, expired.
In compliance with the recommendation contained in Consob Communication No. 11508 dated
February 15, 2000, the following table summarizes the key features of the stock option plans inforce in 2003. For the sake of ensuring a consistent reading of the table, the figures shown 
(for the market prices and the subscription prices of the shares as a result of exercising theoptions), relating to the number, exercise, expiration dates, forfeitures or cancellations whichoccurred prior to the effectiveness of the merger, have been adjusted on the basis of the ratiosand returns thus rendering them comparable to the prices relating to the ordinary shares of the Company resulting from the merger.2003 sustainability section 57Options New options Options Options expired Options forfeited Options of which

/L50123INTRODUCTION
The merger of Telecom Italia into Olivetti was concluded and became effective from 4 August
2003; the company resulting from the merger adopted the name of Telecom Italia. The Board ofDirectors of the new company, elected on 26 May 2003 by the Olivetti shareholders’ meeting,appointed the corporate officers, assigned the related powers and basically took over the
corporate governance system of the “old” (i.e. pre-merger) Telecom Italia. However, it alsoadopted a new Self-Regulatory Code HYPERLINKcontaining significant innovations with respect tothe earlier governance rules in the light of international best practice.In general, the Company’s corporate governance system is based on the central role of the Boardof Directors, transparency in operational decisions, effective internal controls and rigorous rulesgoverning conflicts of interest. This system, designed and constructed bearing in mind theprinciples formulated by the Committee for Corporate Governance of Borsa Italiana (known as thePreda Code), has been implemented with the adoption of codes, rules and procedures coveringthe activity of all the organizational and operational components of the Company. Thesedocuments are checked constantly and updated to respond effectively to legislative and regulatorydevelopments and changes in operational practice. This section of the Report describes how Telecom Italia’s corporate governance system workedduring the year. The name Telecom Italia indicates the company resulting from the merger,without a break vis-à-vis the “old” Telecom Italia; where appropriate, reference will also be madeto the activity of Olivetti S.p.A. before the merger.The present section represents an extract of the corresponding section of the “Report onoperations 2003”, to which reference is made for the complete text Da inserire nella nota amargine.

The Board of Directors has the power (and the duty) to lead the Company by pursuing the
primary objective of creating value for its shareholders; to that end it takes all the decisionsneeded to achieve the corporate purpose (Article 2 of the Self-Regulatory Code). The Self-Regulatory Code reserves several especially important tasks exclusively to the Board, includingthose of:
(i) examining and approving the strategic, business and financial plans of the Company and the
Group; 
(ii) evaluating and approving the annual budget of the Company and the Group;(iii) examining and approving transactions – including investments and disinvestments – with a
substantial impact on the Company’s activity in view of their nature, strategic importance orsize;

61 Shareholders/L50123Meetings
The Self-Regulatory Code requires the Board to meet periodically (and at least quarterly).
In 2003 the Board of Directors met 11 times (the Board of Directors of Olivetti met 5 timesbefore the merger). Board meetings were always well attended, with 81% of the directors beingpresent on average. The independent directors were assiduous participants, with an overallattendance rate of 76%.
When board meetings were to be held, documentation permitting informed participation
in the proceedings was transmitted in good time to the directors and the members of theBoard of Auditors.In November 2003 the Company distributed a calendar scheduling at least 7 meetingsfor 2004.
/L50123Appointment
The members of the Board of Directors are elected by means of “slates” (Article 9 of the bylaws).
The slate system, which de facto renders the creation of a nominating committee superfluous, isdesigned to ensure an adequate representation on the Board of Directors of persons drawn fromlists presented by minority shareholders (slates may be presented by shareholders whoindividually or together with others hold at least 1% of the share capital with the right to vote inordinary shareholders’ meetings).Although the Company’s current Board of Directors was elected by the Olivetti shareholders’meeting of 26 May 2003 under the old Olivetti bylaws, which did not contemplate slates, themeeting basically confirmed the composition of the Board of Directors of the “old” TelecomItalia, which included 3 directors drawn from slates presented in October 2001 by minorityshareholders (Umberto Colombo from the slate presented by the Ministry for the Economy andFinance, and Francesco Denozza and Guido Ferrarini from the slate presented by Italianinstitutional investors). On that occasion the shareholders who put forward the proposals for directors to beappointed made available the profiles of the individual candidates so that all the shareholders
could know their personal and professional data and exercise the right to vote in an informedmanner. This principle is expressly contemplated by the current bylaws of Telecom Italia.
/L50123Composition
Telecom Italia’s Board of Directors has not less than 7 and not more than 23 members; it is up to
the shareholders’ meeting to decide the exact number (Article 9 of the bylaws). The Olivetti shareholders’ meeting of 26 May 2003 elected the present directors afterestablishing their number at 15. The new Board took office on 4 August 2003 (the dateon which the merger became effective) and will remain in office until the date of the approvalof the annual accounts for the year to 31 December 2003. It is made up of the followingdirectors:

/L50123Independent directors
The Company has adopted specific criteria conforming with international best practice
and the Preda Code to qualify directors as “independent”. On the basis of these criteriaand in the light of the declarations submitted by the members of the Board of Directors,5 of the 15 directors are considered independent, namely, Umberto Colombo, FrancescoDenozza, Luigi Fausti, Guido Ferrarini and Natalino Irti. The directors in question:(i) neither have nor have recently had, directly, indirectly or on behalf of third parties,
business relationships of a significance able to influence their autonomous judgement withthe Company, its subsidiaries, the executive directors or the shareholder or group ofshareholders who control the Company. The timeframe considered is the last three fiscalyears for employment and executive directorships and the last fiscal year for other
business relationships;
(ii) do not hold, directly, indirectly or on behalf of third parties, equity interests allowing
them to control the Company or exercise a significant influence over it;
(iii) do not participate in shareholders’ agreements to control the Company or
containing clauses regarding the composition of the Board of Directors or its decisions.This requirement is interpreted broadly, with an eye to the “substantial” independencethat an independent director must enjoy. Accordingly, “participation in shareholders’agreements” precludes independence not only when a natural person, a director

situations indicated above (i.e. persons tied to the Group by significant businessdealings; shareholders or groups of shareholders who control the Company or have asignificant influence over it; participants in shareholders’ agreements to control theCompany or containing clauses regarding the composition of the Board of Directors or itsdecisions).
/L50123Executive directors
The authority to grant delegated powers to directors and revoke such mandates is reserved to the
Board of Directors, which also establishes the limits of such powers, the manner in which theymay be exercised and the quarterly or shorter intervals at which persons with delegated powersmust report to the Board of Directors and the Board of Auditors on the activity performed underthe mandates conferred on them. The authority to determine the duties and powers of the generalmanagers is also reserved to the Board of Directors.On 4 August 2003 the Board of Directors of Telecom Italia, confirming decisions already taken inthe “old” Telecom Italia, appointed Marco Tronchetti Provera as Chairman of the Company,Gilberto Benetton as Deputy Chairman, Carlo Buora and Riccardo Ruggiero as Managing Directors,and Riccardo Ruggiero and Giuseppe Sala as General Managers.The Board of Directors is composed of 3 executive Directors and 12 non-executive Directors, 5 ofwhom, as already said, are indipendent.  The powers delegated to the Company’s executive directors (the Chairman and ManagingDirectors) are as follows:–Marco Tronchetti Provera (Chairman) is entrusted with the powers needed to carry out
every transaction relating to the Company’s activity, except for acquisitions and disposalsof shareholdings involving control or affiliation, and of businesses or business segmentswhere the value of the transaction exceeds 
€ 250 million. Moreover, the Chairman must
sign jointly with a Managing Director for the issue of guarantees in respect of bonds ofTelecom Italia or its subsidiaries where the amount exceeds 
€ 250 million and in respect
of bonds of third parties where the amount exceeds € 100 million. The Chairman is
authorized to act as a matter of urgency in the matters for which the Board of Directors iscompetent and is entrusted with the tasks of reporting to the Board of Auditors in themanner and within the time limits established in the bylaws, overseeing the managementof confidential information and ensuring the effectiveness and adequacy of the internalcontrol system.
–Carlo Buora (Managing Director) is authorized to carry out every transaction relating to the
Company’s activity, except for acquisitions and disposals where the amount of the transactionexceeds 
€ 150 million. Mr. Buora may issue guarantees in respect of bonds of Telecom Italia or

–Riccardo Ruggiero (Managing Director) is authorized to carry out every transaction relating to
the Company’s activity, except for investments and disposals where the amount of thetransaction exceeds 
€ 75 million and the issue of guarantees.
For the purposes of compliance with the above-mentioned thresholds, a set of transactionsthat individually fall below the relevant threshold but are interconnected within the samestrategic or executive structure are considered to constitute a single transaction and,accordingly, may exceed the threshold.In practice, transactions of particular significance have been submitted to the Board ofDirectors even though their conclusion theoretically fell within the scope of the executivedirectors’ delegated powers.

nature (e.g. transactions with related parties and atypical or unusual transactions), strategicimportance or size is reserved to the Board of Directors.Moreover, the Company has adopted a procedure formalizing the rules for gathering andtransmitting information to the Board of Auditors and the Board of Directors on the activityperformed, transactions with major implications for the profitability, financial position and/orbalance sheet of the Company and the Group, transactions with related parties (includingintra-group dealings) and atypical or unusual transactions. This procedure generatesthe information flows by means of which the directors with delegated powers periodicallyreport to the Board of Directors and the Board of Auditors not only on the steps they havetaken under their mandates, through the organizational structure of the Company and itssubsidiaries or otherwise, including the decisions adopted and the projects launched,but also on the implementation of transactions already approved by the Board of Directors.
/L50123Directors’ remuneration
It is up to the Board of Directors to determine the remuneration of the Chairman and the
Managing Directors, after examining the proposals of the Board’s Remuneration Committeeand consulting the Board of Auditors. The Board is also required to allocate the totalcompensation to be paid to the individual members of the Board and its committees if theshareholders’ meeting has not already done so.The Board’s Remuneration Committee is charged with fact-finding and advisory functions.In particular, it formulates proposals for the remuneration of the directors who hold particularoffices and (acting on a report by the Managing Directors) for the criteria for the remunerationof the Company’s senior management. The Committee is composed exclusively of non-executive directors (Umberto Colombo, Pier Francesco Saviotti and Luigi Fausti, chairman), themajority of whom are independent (Umberto Colombo and Luigi Fausti).The Committee held two meetings in 2003.As with the Board’s composition, in the case of directors’ compensation the Olivettishareholders’ meeting of 26 May 2003 again simply replicated the situation existing in the“old” Telecom Italia, In particular, the total annual compensation of the Board of Directors wasfixed at 
€ 1,860,000, equivalent to the figure of 3.6 billion lire decided by the shareholders’
meeting of the “old” Telecom Italia on 7 November 2001.The current remuneration system for executive directors provides for them to receive a fixedcomponent and a variable component, subject to the achievement of pre-established budgetobjectives (EBIT with positive Delta EVA). On the other hand, there is no provision for stockoptions for the directors (whether executive or non-executive). Further information on the division of the total compensation among the members of theBoard of Directors as well as on the compensation paid to the executive directors can be foundin a table in the Notes to the Accounts.Lastly, the remuneration system for management provides performance and loyalty incentiveson top of a basic salary. The incentives include stock options. Details in this regard are given inthe section on “Human Resources”.
/L50123THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM
/L50123The internal control system, internal auditing and the organizational model
The Company’s internal control system is conceived as a process for the achievement of
substantial and procedural fairness, transparency and accountability by ensuring that corporateoperations are efficient and can be known and verified, that accounting and operational data areaccurate, that applicable laws and regulations are complied with, and that the assets of thebusiness are safeguarded, not least with a view to preventing the perpetration of fraud againstthe Company and the consequent repercussions on the shareholders.

61 ShareholdersThe cardinal rules of Telecom Italia’s internal control system are:
(i) separation of roles in the performance of the principal activities involved in each operating
process;
(ii) traceability and constant visibility of decisions, so that responsibility can be pinpointed and
the rationale identified; 
(iii) decision-making on an objective basis, so that purely subjective considerations are set aside
and decisions are taken according to criteria that are established in advance and can beverified.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the internal control system. It lays down the guidelinesfor the system and verifies that it is adequate and works effectively, making sure that the main
corporate risks are appropriately identified and managed. To verify the correct operation of theinternal control system the Board uses the Committee for Internal Control and CorporateGovernance and a suitably independent person endowed with sufficient resources to perform theinternal control function.There is a broad consensus, both in theory and in international practice, that the tasks of theperson responsible for internal control should be to verify the adequacy and effectiveness of thesystem and, where anomalies are found, to recommend the necessary remedies. In conformitywith this approach, Telecom Italia has appointed the Company’s internal auditor (Telecom ItaliaAudit), in the person of the director assigned to the task, to be responsible for its internal control
system.A director appointed for the purpose (currently the Chairman of the Board) determines themechanisms of the internal control system and the manner in which it is to be implementedunder the guidelines established by the Board, and ensures the system’s overall adequacy, itseffectiveness and its adaptation to changes in operating conditions and the legislative andregulatory framework. Any “maintenance” work that the person responsible for the internalcontrol system may recommend is performed by the competent sectors of the Company or Groupcompanies. The efficient operation of the system is promoted by the appointment of managers ofparticular standing and authority within the organization as “persons responsible forimplementation”.Internal auditing has been entrusted by the Group to a consortium company called TelecomItalia Audit, in which Tim and TI Media also hold equity interests. The organizational solutionadopted maximizes the independence of the appointed company in the performance of theinternal audit function within Telecom Italia. Audit reports are submitted to the competentTelecom Italia director, the Committee for Internal Control and Corporate Governance and the
Board of the Auditors.This organizational solution has been submitted to PriceWaterhouseCoopers for strategicanalysis. The Institute of Internal Auditors will conduct a quality assessment of Telecom ItaliaAudit to verify its operating capacity in terms of organization, methods and professional
resources and the degree of assurance it provides.The Group’s internal control system was implemented during the year through the adoption ofan ad hoc organizational model designed in particular to meet the needs arising fromLegislative Decree 231/2001 concerning the administrative liability of companies for crimescommitted by their employees or collaborators.The organizational model is based on the principles of the Group’s Code of Ethics andfocused on situations where there is a significant risk of crime (corruption, extortion,
misappropriation, undue receipt of disbursements, fraud against the State, etc.).In particular, it consists of rules for dealings with representatives of governmental bodies thatapply the precepts of the Code of Ethics at the operational level and “internal control
checklists” that list the rules for identifying the principal phases of every process, the possiblecrimes in connection with the individual processes, and the control activities for preventing therelated risks.The functioning of the model and compliance with it are monitored by a Supervisory Panelcomposed of a member of the Board of Auditors (Ferdinando Superti Furga, chairman), an

61 Shareholdersindependent director who is a member of the Committee for Internal Control and Corporate
Governance (Guido Ferrarini) and the person responsible for internal control. The panel’scomposition thus embraces all the professional skills that contribute to corporate control andhighlights its autonomy.The Supervisory Panel will encourage the Board of Directors to adapt the model as needed tochanges in the legislative and regulatory framework, the nature of the Company’s businessactivities and the ways they are conducted. It reports to the Board of Directors, the Committeefor Internal Control and Corporate Governance and the Board of Auditors on the checks performed
and their results.
/L50123The Committee for Internal Control and Corporate Governance
The Board of Directors of Telecom Italia has its own Committee for Internal Control and
Corporate Governance, charged with advisory functions and the formulation of proposals.The Committee:(i) evaluates the adequacy of the internal control system; (ii) evaluates the work plan prepared by the person responsible for internal control, from whom
it receives periodic reports;
(iii) assesses, together with the heads of the Company’s administrative departments and the
external auditors, whether the accounting policies have been correctly applied and arehomogeneous for the purpose of preparing the consolidated accounts; 
(iv) evaluates the proposals made by the external auditors in order to be awarded the
appointment, the audit plan and the results set out in the letter of suggestions;
(v) reports to the Board of Directors at least once every half year on the activity performed and
the adequacy of the internal control system; 
(vi) performs the additional tasks that may be assigned to it by the Board of Directors,
particularly as regards relations with the external auditors; 
(vii) monitors compliance with the rules of corporate governance and the periodic updating
thereof.
The Committee is composed exclusively of independent directors (Luigi Fausti, Natalino Irtiand Guido Ferrarini, chairman). In 2003 it held seven meetings, which were assiduouslyattended by its members. Committee meetings are also attended by the Chairman of the
Board of Auditors or by the auditor he designates. Where it is deemed desirable in the lightof the issues on the agenda, the Committee for Internal Control and Corporate Governanceand the Board of Auditors may hold joint meetings.In 2003 the Committee contributed significantly to the process of implementing theCompany’s system of corporate governance, taking part in the analysis and drafting of thedocuments that the Company adopted. Special mention should be made of the new GroupProcedure for the Appointment of External Auditors, approved by the Board of Directors on 10October 2003, which not only satisfies the requirements of Italian law but also takes intoaccount the obligations arising from the fact that Telecom Italia is registered under Section12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is therefore subject to US securities laws and,in particular, to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the implementing regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commission. Following the merger the Committee participatedactively in revising and updating the governance mechanisms originally put in place by the“old” Telecom Italia, paying constant attention to legislative and regulatory changes and todevelopments in the field of self-regulation.The Committee periodically checked the activities performed by the internal auditor andexamined the request the external auditors submitted after the merger for an increase in thefees that the Olivetti Shareholders’ Meeting had originally approved.

61 Shareholders/L50123BOARD OF AUDITORS
The Company’s Board of Auditors was appointed by the Olivetti shareholders’ meeting of 26 May
2003 and has five members: Ferdinando Superti Furga (Chairman), Gianfranco Zanda, SalvatoreSpiniello, Rosalba Casiraghi and Paolo Golia. Rosalba Casiraghi and Paolo Golia were elected fromslates presented by minority shareholders (Article 16 of the bylaws).The Board of Auditors plays a key role in the Company’s system of corporate governance.This is confirmed not only by the number of meetings in 2003 (no less than 25, of which some,as mentioned earlier, were held jointly with the Committee for Internal Control and CorporateGovernance) but also by the Company’s choices with regard to US company law.More specifically, the Board of Auditors has been identified as Telecom Italia’s Audit Committee forthe purposes of the applicable US legislation. In fact the SEC has allowed foreign companies torefrain from establishing an audit committee from among the directors when their governingbodies already include a “board of auditors” that is separate from the board of directors and notan expression of the management and that is responsible – within the limits of applicable law –“for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of any registered publicaccounting firm engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performingother audit, review or attest services for the issuer”. This body – which is required to “establishprocedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internalaccounting controls or auditing matters, including procedures for the confidential, anonymoussubmission by employees of the issuer of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditingmatters” (currently being prepared) – must be provided with appropriate funding to engageindependent counsel and other advisors. Among other things the US legislation makes it obligatory for the audit committee to approve allthe services rendered by the auditing firm (and associated persons) to the issuer and its directlyand indirectly controlled subsidiaries. Telecom Italia has consequently adopted a Group Procedurefor the Appointment of Auditors that establishes the general principle of centralized control of
relations with auditing firms with the aim of preventing engagements being granted to firms thatfail to comply with the applicable Italian or US law and could undermine auditor independence.The procedure regulates the engagement of auditing firms and persons (consulting firms, lawfirms, etc.) associated with the auditing firm on a continuous basis and significantly limits the
power of the Board of Directors (and the management) while enhancing the control functionperformed by Telecom Italia’s Board of Auditors. At the same time the Company has adopted thegeneral principle of employing the same auditing firm throughout the group it heads and requiresthe appointment of a different firm to be agreed in advance with the parent company following areasoned request on which Telecom Italia’s Board of Auditors gives its opinion on the basis ofinvestigations carried out by the person responsible for internal control.In order to make available the broad range of information needed by the Board of Auditors toperform its control function effectively, a specific procedure has been put in place, as mentionedearlier, for the collection and transmission to the members of the Board of Auditors (and thedirectors) of in-depth information on:1. the activity carried out by the Company, with special reference to the implementation of
transactions already approved by the Board of Directors and the action taken by executivedirectors in the exercise of their delegated powers, including the projects launched;
2. the transactions of greatest significance for the Company’s profitability, financial position and
balance sheet, highlighting the strategic goals, consistency with the budget and the businessplan, the manner of implementation and developments, and any resulting constraints on orimplications for the activity of the Group;
3. any transactions potentially involving a conflict of interest, i.e. intra-group transactions and
transactions with related parties other than those of an intra-group nature. The information onsuch transactions must indicate the underlying interest for the Company (and in the case ofintra-group transactions their rationale within the context of the Group), as well as the mannerof implementation and the evaluation procedures followed;

the transaction falls outside the normal sphere of the Company’s business and those that haveparticularly critical aspects in relation to their nature, the risks inherent in the type of thecounterparty or the time needed for their implementation. Here again the informationprovided must indicate the underlying interest for the Company and describe the manner ofimplementation of the transactions, with special reference to the evaluation proceduresfollowed.
/L50123SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETINGS
Ordinary and extraordinary shareholder’s meetings of the “old” Telecom Italia and Olivetti
were held on respectively 24 and 26 May 2003. In addition to adopting the annual reports for the
year to 31 December 2002, the shareholders of the two companies approved the merger of
Telecom Italia into Olivetti and the contemporaneous change of the latter’s name to Telecom
Italia. Subsequently, on 9 June 2003, a special meeting of the “old” Telecom Italia’s savingsshareholders was held.The Company seeks to encourage and facilitate shareholders’ participation in meetings byproviding the documents needed to follow the discussion and allowing ordinary shareholders tovote by mail. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 18 of the bylaws, the Company assists associations
of employee shareholders by making available special areas where they can provide informationand collect proxy forms.At present the Company does not have any rules of proceeding for shareholders’ meetings sincethose adopted by the “old” Telecom Italia’s shareholders’ meeting on 20 October 2000 lapsedwhen the company’s merger into Olivetti became effective. However, the Board of Directorsintends to propose the adoption of new rules to the shareholders’ meeting called to approve theAnnual Report for the year to 31 December 2003.
/L50123CODE OF ETHICS
The Code of Ethics of the Telecom Italia Group can ideally be considered as lying upstream
from the whole system of corporate governance and as enshrining the set of fundamentalvalues and principles that serve to ensure an ethically-oriented conduct of business. The Code,
which has gradually been adopted by all the companies belonging to the Group, specifies theobjectives to be aimed at and the values to be fostered in relation to all the main stakeholdersTelecom Italia interacts with every day: shareholders, financial markets, customers, local
communities and employees.Like all the Company’s other instruments of corporate governance, the Code of Ethics iscontinuously reviewed in the light of developments in the applicable law and operational andmarket practices, and with consideration also given to the results of the monitoring of units’compliance by the person responsible for internal control. The current version of the Code hasrecently been revised to take account, among other things, of US requirements andsuggestions.

The Company has adopted a series of guidelines HYPERLINKon the way transactions with related
parties are to be carried out.

adequately informed of all the relevant aspects (the nature of the relationship, the manner ofcarrying out the transaction, the economic and other conditions, the evaluation procedures used,the rationale for the transaction and the Company’s interest in its implementation and theassociated risks). Moreover, if the related party is a director or a third party that is related via adirector, the person concerned may only provide clarifications and must leave the meeting whenthe motion is examined and put to a vote. Depending on the nature, value and other characteristics of related-party transactions, the Boardmay be assisted by one or more outside experts engaged to give an opinion on their economicclauses and/or legitimacy and/or technical aspects, in order to prevent their being concluded atinappropriate conditions. Such experts must have suitable professional experience andqualifications in the field in question and their independence and freedom from conflicts ofinterests must be carefully assessed.
/L50123HANDLING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, THE DISCLOSURE
COMMITTEE AND THE CODE OF CONDUCT FOR INSIDER DEALING
Transparent relations with holders of the Company’s financial instruments and, more generally,
with the financial markets, and the provision of accurate, clear and complete information arestandards for the conduct of the members of the governing bodies, the management and all theworkers of the Telecom Italia Group.
Confidential information is managed by the director appointed for the purpose (currently theChairman of the Board) on the basis of procedures for the internal handling and disclosure tothird parties of documents and information concerning the Company, with special reference toprice-sensitive information.A special procedure establishes the ways in which price-sensitive information is to becommunicated to the market. It identifies the units of the Company’s organization involved andlays down guidelines for the action to be taken in the presence of rumours and in response torequests for information from those responsible for supervising and operating the markets(Consob and Borsa Italiana). The procedure also lays down guidelines for meetings with thefinancial community and the press, to ensure that information concerning the Company and the
Group is not disclosed selectively.The Company has also established a Disclosure Committee to provide assistance to the Board ofDirectors and top management as regards the processing and handling of data and newsnecessary for the correct provision of information. The main tasks of the Committee are:(i) to assist the Board in the preparation of corporate communications, the top management in
the certification of the annual report in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and thedirector appointed to handle price-sensitive information;
(ii) to ensure that corporate communications are prepared correctly with a view to their approval
by the competent body;
(iii) to monitor the application of the procedures and controls for the collection, analysis and
retention of data and information for publication and filing, verify their adequacy andeffectiveness and propose corrective measures;
(iv) to verify the correct application and need for updating of the “Procedure for communicating
price-sensitive information” and suggest improvements where appropriate;
(v) to supervise the structure and updating of the Company’s website as regards its institutional
contents.
Lastly, the Telecom Italia has a Code of Conduct for Insider Dealing that lays down the disclosurerequirements and rules applicable to transactions involving financial instruments carried out bypersons who, as a consequence of their position in the Company, have access to materialinformation (taken to mean information on matters capable of producing significant changes inthe outlook for the profitability, financial position and/or balance sheet of the Company and the

question). The criteria applied in drawing up the Code are consistent with the basic choicesunderpinning the Company’s system of corporate governance: rigour, transparency and alignmentwith best international practice. The key features of the Code are:–flexibility in identifying the persons subject to the disclosure obligations, to take account of
situations where persons come to have temporary access to inside information;
–immediate disclosure to the market of transactions whose amount, summed with the amounts
of other transactions carried out in the three preceding months and not yet declared to theCompany, exceeds 
€ 80,000;
–quarterly disclosure of transactions whose cumulativ e amount is more than 35,000 and less
than € 80,000;
–extension of the disclosure obligations to the exercise of stock options and pre-emption rights
and all transactions involving securities issued by companies belonging to the Telecom ItaliaGroup, even when carried out under a contract for the management of an investment portfoliounder which the investor renounces the right to give instructions;
–black-out periods during which, in general, persons subject to the disclosure obligations may
not carry out transactions.
In the event of non-compliance, the Code provides for particularly severe sanctions; where theoffender is a director or a member of the Board of Auditors, the Board of Directors may proposethe revocation of his/her appointment to the next shareholders’ meeting.
