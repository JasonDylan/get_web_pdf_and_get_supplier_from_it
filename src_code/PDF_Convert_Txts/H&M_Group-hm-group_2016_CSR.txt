The H&M group makes affordable, good-quality and sustainable 
fashion available for many people, regardless of their income or 
where they live – that is our passion and our everyday work.
We believe sustainable fashion should 
be available for everyone. The idea is 
that people who enjoy fashion should be 
equally able to dress sustainably. How -
ever, to be able to continue to offer sus -
tainable fashion to present and future generations in a world with growing pop -
ulations and finite resources, both the 
H&M group and the industry must look 
for new ways of working. That is why we are taking a circular approach to how fashion is made and used. That includes 
a more effective use of resources, support 
of innovations within recycling tech -
nologies as well as an increased use of 
existing or new sustainable materials. 
Our ongoing work to contribute to good working conditions for the people mak -
ing our products is just as important.
Investing in sustainability issues such 
as these is a business opportunity – and 
vital for our future business success. But also, as stated in international guidelines 
such as the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights, it’s part of our responsibility as a company. Corpo -
rations have a big responsibility to act in a way that helps to drive change, making their business economically, socially and 
environmentally sustainable. 
Our sustainability work is built on three 
foundations. First, it’s integrated into 
all parts of the business – in every single department and function and in all 
brands and markets. Sustainability is 
part of our company’s DNA and values.

term way of working is the only way 
forward. As a result, we always take 
a long-term view instead of choosing short-term solutions that don’t lead 
to lasting change. Finally, we have a 
collaborative mindset. As many of the challenges we are facing are systemic 
and industry-wide, we need to work with 
others. Our collaboration with brands, trade unions, NGOs, experts and scien -
tists, business partners and civil society will continue – no matter if it’s about recycling innovations, new sustainable 
materials or the work to improve  
working conditions for the people  making our clothes. 
This is why we very much welcome  
the collaborative focus within the UN  
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
and the SDG Agenda. Through our continued commitment to the United 
Nations Global Compact, we take shared 
responsibility for achieving positive change. Our sustainability priorities 
are aligned with the SDGs and aim to 
mobilise efforts to end poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change, 
see more on p. 117. The SDG Agenda pro -
vides a good framework when designing 
strategies going forward and finding new 
collaborations. 
We contribute to several of the SDGs, for 
example, through our circular approach 
and efforts to close the loop on textiles 
(SDG 12). We are a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Circular Econ -
omy 100 to help accelerate the transition from a linear to a circular economy. From

to act in a way that makes it possible not just for the present but also future  generations to enjoy fashion.  
”
a sustainability perspective, this tran -
sition is necessary. However, it requires 
more effective use of resources as well as 
innovations within recycling and mate -
rials. Garment collecting in our stores is 
one step on our circularity journey, invit -
ing our customers to become part of the solution and help expand the lifespan of 
garments and increase reuse or recycling 
of materials. The Global Change Award

porting this development through both investments and knowledge.
Our efforts to improve working condi -
tions in the countries where our prod -
ucts are made is also in line with the 
SDG Agenda (SDG 8). We are committed 
to focusing our efforts on creating a well-functioning dialogue in the labour 
market since this is a precondition for 
achieving lasting improvements in work -
ing conditions for people. We are work -
ing to promote a dialogue where free -
dom of association is respected, where 
workers’ representatives have a voice 
and where trade unions can negotiate and bargain collectively. These issues 
are also central in several of our collab -
orations, for example, within the Global 
Framework Agreement with IndustriALL and IF Metall which was converted into 
a permanent partnership in 2016. 
The H&M group wants to contribute to 
structures and frameworks, to inspire, 
educate and bring the best from the Swedish labour market to countries like 
Bangladesh and Cambodia – but we will 
not be able to push development on our own. The countries and the people living 
there should be in charge – but obviously with support from the H&M group and 
many others who want to continue their 
commitment in these countries in the long term. 
It has always been important for us to 
act in a way that makes it possible not 
just for present but also future genera -
tions to enjoy fashion. However, along 
with the rest of the industry, we still 
have a long way to go. It is now time to 
lift our ambitions and push the bound -
aries again. I’m convinced that our new 
sustainability strategy presented in this 
report will take us closer towards our vision: to lead the change towards circu -
lar and renewable fashion while being  
a fair and equal company.

our environment and our society are 
facing some serious challenges. The rise in global temperatures is already 
affecting our climate, and the world 
needs to stay well below a 2°C increase to avoid increasingly damaging out -
comes. According to the World Bank, we will soon face a global shortage of vital resources. For example, there is a 
projected 40% gap between water sup -
ply and demand by 2030,* and we are 
losing about 130,000 square kilometres 
– equivalent to 48 football fields every 
minute – of forest every year.**The H&M group has a strong history in sustainability. Ultimately, 
we want to make sure that fashion continues to be enjoyed today 
and for generations to come. But to create a truly sustainable 
fashion industry that is good for people, communities and the planet, we need to take our work to the next level. Our vision is 
therefore to use our size and scale to lead the change towards 
circular and renewable fashion while being a fair and equal company. This vision applies to every brand in the H&M group,  
all of which share the same passion for fashion and quality, as well 
as the ambition to serve our customers in a sustainable way.
Our global society is also facing serious 
challenges. Many people are already 
living in extreme poverty, and issues 
such as forced labour and discrimination prevent millions of people from living  
a good life. 
These challenges are compounded by the 
size and growth of the world’s popula -
tion, which is set to increase from seven 
billion people today to about eight and 
a half billion by 2030*** – five billion 
of whom are predicted to move into the middle class.**** This growth and demo -

and industry. By preparing to meet this change in a sustainable way, businesses 
have an opportunity to flourish and cre -

the world. 
We believe that our industry needs to 
increase the pace of change in addressing 
these global environmental and social 
issues. The size, scale and global reach of the H&M group means we have a respon -sibility – and an opportunity – to create this acceleration and facilitate the right 
collaborations for success. We believe  
in moving the whole market forward,  for our own business and for other busi -

Adopting a 100% Circular & Renewable 
approach to making and using fashion is 
an essential step to helping our business 
continue to thrive for the next decades and beyond. It’s not just important, but a pre -
requisite for our growth and future success, just as it is for every other fashion brand. 
When it comes to striving for 100% Fair 
& Equal, we want our business to benefit everyone it connects with, from empow -
ering our customers to express their personality through fashion – wherever they are in the world – to the millions of 
people who work across our value chain. 
By building stronger, more rewarding con -
nections with our customers, employees 
and suppliers, our business will benefit in 
many different ways. 
Our new vision sets a high bar. Ultimately, 
it will help us create sustained and bal -
anced growth that meets demand while 
also helping to improve our environment 
and society. However, although this vision is essential to the future of our business, we 
don’t yet have all of the solutions in place 
for achieving our goals, many of which are breaking new ground. We know there is 
a significant journey ahead of us, but our 
vision gives us clear long-term focus and direction and provides the motivation we 
will need to succeed.fashion. It is built on our vision to use  
our size and scale to lead the change 
towards circular and renewable fashion 
while being a fair and equal company. This vision is built on three ambitions: 
100% LEADING THE CHANGE
– Promote and scale innovation
– Drive transparency
– Reward sustainable actions
100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE
–  A circular approach to how products  are made and used 
–  Use only recycled or sustainably  
sourced materials
–  Use only renewable energy in our  
value chain
100% FAIR & EQUAL
– Fair jobs for all 
–  Stewards for diversity and inclusiveness
Our commitment to 100% Leading the change will drive and accelerate our impact as we seek to fulfil our vision. To us, it is an 
ambition that can help set new standards, 
find innovative solutions and discover new ways of engaging our stakeholders to create 
a truly sustainable fashion industry. 
Of course, it is important to recognise the 
business case that our vision represents.

The H&M group has come a long way 
since our first sustainability strategy in 
2009. In 2016, we reported on our seven 
Conscious Commitments for the last time. This year, we have started report -
ing on our new vision and strategy.
We have developed our new strategy in 
partnership with internal and external 
stakeholders and experts from across our value chain. We mapped and prioritised 
our human rights risks, and identified 
how we could leverage positive change by addressing these risks. And we used 
an inclusive and science-based process. 
Working with our partners, we defined our ambition areas as 100% Leading the 
change, 100% Circular & Renewable and 
100% Fair & Equal. Each area is covered in an individual chapter in this report. 
That said ‘100%’ is not an exact goal – it 
demonstrates the scale of our ambition 
and our commitment to change, and 
creates a clear long-term direction and momentum at H&M group and across 
our industry that will lead to the best 
possible results.At the heart of our sustainability work is our Change-Making Programme, 
which makes our strategy come to life. By 
bringing together all of the component parts of our strategy, including our goals, 
roadmaps, standards and methods, it 
integrates sustainability into every part of our business. Read more about the 
Change-Making Programme on page 17. 
Underpinning all of this is our ongoing 
commitment to engage changemakers 
– the people from across our value chain who turn goals and ambitions into action 
and achievements. There is simply no way 
we will fulfil our vision without their help.VISION & STRATEGYMESSAGE FROM OUR CEO / KEY FACTS & FIGURES 2016 / OUR VISION / OUR STRATEGY  / Q&A WITH THE HEAD OF SUSTAINABILITY / OUR CHANGE-MAKING PROGRAMME / HOW WE ARE ORGANISED / IMPACTS ALONG OUR VALUE CHAIN

Q&A with Anna Gedda, head of sustainabilityVision & Strategy
Why has the H&M group updated its 
sustainability strategy? 
The H&M group has been committed to 
sustainability for a long time, and we are proud of what we have achieved so far. 
But the fashion industry is still facing big 
challenges and we need to rethink how fashion is made and used. We have the 
size, scale and ambition to help lead  
that change. 
Sustainability is fundamental to the 
future of our business. Looking 20 or 30 years ahead, we need a strategy that 
will both help ensure that our planet 
has enough resources to go around and that enables us to use and produce those 
materials in a sustainable way. 
Our new strategy is built on years of 
hard work and experiences of both 
successes and setbacks. But all of the original building blocks, such as set -
ting long-term goals, collaboration and integrating sustainability in all of our business operations, are still there. Our Anna Gedda, head of sustainability at 
the H&M group, explains where the 
new strategy came from and how it will become a reality. seven Conscious Commitments helped us achieve a lot, and our new vision and focus areas will take us even further. 
 
What makes the H&M group’s sustaina -
bility strategy unique?  
Many things. First, our ambition. We want to lead the change towards a circu -
lar and renewable fashion industry while 
also being a fair and equal company. That 
is a huge commitment to make. 
Second, the size of our business. We are 
one of the world’s biggest fashion compa -
nies. This comes with both responsibility 
and opportunities as we have a unique 
reach and possibility to create change. Because of this, our sustainability ambi -
tions won’t just set our agenda, they will help drive change across the industry.  
The third thing that makes our strategy 
unique is that it is about true sustaina -
bility. We are not here to outperform our 
competitors. It doesn’t matter if we have 
the smallest carbon footprint compared to anyone else. Instead, we are using a 
scientific approach to find out where our 
planet needs us to be – in terms of our environmental and social impact – and 
then setting goals around that. 
And finally, because there is simply no way we will be able to reach these 
goals without getting our customers, employees, business partners and other 
stakeholders on board, our strategy is 
founded on the need for engagement  
and collaboration. 
 
How can you continue to expand while also becoming more sustainable?  
According to the UN, there will be 9.7 billion people living on this planet by 2050, with a rapidly growing middle 
class. We believe that all of these peo -
ple should be able to access and afford 
clothes they love that are also sustain -
able – no matter where they live or how much money they have. To accomplish this, we have to grow our business sus -
tainably and move towards a circular use of resources. That means making sure our growth is not linked to, or dependent 
on, similar growth in our resource use.  
It won’t happen overnight, but we will get there. 
Leadership is obviously a key element  
of the new strategy. Why is that?  
Our size, scale and influence mean that 
we have both a responsibility to do the right thing and an opportunity to create 
real, lasting change. We have the ability 
to create large-scale impacts that few others have. VISION & STRATEGYMESSAGE FROM OUR CEO / KEY FACTS & FIGURES 2016 / OUR VISION / OUR STRATEGY / Q&A WITH THE HEAD OF SUSTAINABILITY / OUR CHANGE-MAKING PROGRAMME / HOW WE ARE ORGANISED / IMPACTS ALONG OUR VALUE CHAIN

For me, being a leader means using this 
position to lead by example and break 
new ground. By testing new ideas or 
doing what others have not done before, we can pave the way and try new things. 
This will also hopefully lead others to 
follow our example or join us in our movement for change. 
Of course, while being first gives you an 
advantage, it also means you are more 
likely to make mistakes. That’s why it 
is important to remember that perfect is the enemy of good. Instead of putting 
brands off from taking the kind of bold 
steps we need, I hope that we can cele -
brate the milestones that take us closer 
to a more sustainable industry. I believe 
leadership deserves both scrutiny and encouragement, and I hope our efforts 
will attract both.
 What does 100% mean? 
Basically, ‘100%’ is our ultimate ambi -
tion, and it will take us decades to 
achieve. Any company can say it wants 
to become circular, but unless we all aim 
for 100% we’ll never fully get there. We want to be part of the solution and help 
advance science in this area, and to do 
that we need to be transparent about our ambitions. Our roadmap doesn’t have all the answers on how we’ll get there, but we do know you have to be bold to 
make things happen. For us, 100% is not 
necessarily an exact measurement, but a way to demonstrate our ambition and 
create action – both within our company 
and outside of it.  
Which sustainability achievements are 
you most proud of from 2016? 
I’m really proud of our ambition to 
become 100% Circular. It’s a big, daring commitment, and I see it is an achieve -
ment to have made it. Obviously, it’s the starting point for much more to come! Looking at the challenges around 
resource use that not only our, but all 
industries face, this marks such an important step towards a more sustaina -
ble way of making and enjoying fashion. 
I’m also proud of the steps we’ve taken to 
become more transparent, in particular the extent to which we’ve implemented 
and used the Higg Index* to evaluate our 
suppliers. The Higg Index exists to help 
businesses like ours get a clear picture of our environmental, social and labour 
impacts and identify areas for improve -
ment. See more in the Standards & 
Policies chapter on p. 99. It takes time to 
both create a universal standard and for 
it to be adopted industry-wide to work. 
No other brand of our size has made this kind of commitment to transparency yet, 
but we hope that by us using it, others 
will follow. 
After a successful first year, we also 
extended our Global Framework Agree -
ment to become a permanent collabora -
tion with IndustriALL and the Swedish trade union IF Metall. We see this as a foundation for creating a well-functioning 
dialogue between our suppliers and local trade unions, which is necessary for last -
ing improvements in all areas of working conditions, including fair living wages. 
Finally, I would like to mention the work 
we’re doing to engage our customers 
to be more sustainable. We need their help if we’re going to reach our goals. 
For example, since we introduced our 
garment collecting initiative globally in 2013, we have gathered almost 39,000 
tonnes of garments to give them a new 
life so nothing goes to waste. By showing them that sustainability is part of the 
H&M group’s brands, we’re changing 
their behaviour when it comes to caring for and disposing of clothes. Our objec -
tive is to make fashion sustainable and sustainability fashionable. 
What does sustainability mean to you? 
For me, it’s very real and a big part of both my professional and private life. 
I have two young children and I want 
to know that I’m leaving them a better world to build their lives in. That means 
everything from taking care of how we 
use resources to helping people around the world enjoy good and healthy lives 
in a more fair and inclusive society. I’m 
really proud to be working for a company that wants to be part of making this 
change happen.
“  Our size, scale and influence mean we 
have both a responsibility to do the right thing and an opportunity  to create real lasting change.

Our Change-Making Programme is 
the ‘nuts and bolts’ of how we turn our 
sustainability strategy into action and 
make our vision a reality. 
The H&M group is a big, global and diverse fashion 
company and we recognise (perhaps more than 
most) that one size doesn’t fit all. The Change-Making 
Programme will allow us to integrate sustainability into our business by bringing our sustainability 
strategy to life in a systematic way across all of our 
functions, brands and countries. It makes sustain -
ability a practical part of everyone’s dailyworking 
life. The programme brings together the goals, 
roadmaps, standards and follow-up methods we will need to work towards our vision while at the 
same time leaving room for locally-tailored imple -
mentation and activities.

NB: At the time of print, we are still defining some of the initial goals for our 
sustainability strategy. For the best results, goal-setting must be an ongoing process that works with the latest insights and information available and is supported by our internal functions and external stakeholders. By constantly improving our goals, we will stay aligned internally on fulfilling our vision. We anticipate all initial goals to be set throughout 2017 and onwards. Please see the interview on p. 18. for more information on our goal-setting process.VISION & STRATEGYMESSAGE FROM OUR CEO / KEY FACTS & FIGURES 2016 / OUR VISION / OUR STRATEGY / Q&A WITH THE HEAD OF SUSTAINABILITY / OUR CHANGE-MAKING PROGRAMME  / HOW WE ARE ORGANISED / IMPACTS ALONG OUR VALUE CHAINTHE H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 18 OF 124HOW WE REPORT ABOUT THE H&M GROUP STANDARDS & POLICIES 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE 100% FAIR & EQUAL
What’s your background and role at the 
H&M group?
I started out in the buying office at H&M in 
2004. Five years ago, I moved to the Global Sustainability Department to work on circu -
larity and sustainable materials as an expert in sustainable business. I am also the Global Project Manager for the garment collecting 
initiative. 
How will the H&M group reach 100% 
circularity?
Reaching 100% circularity is an ambitious vision, and we don’t have all the answers for 
getting there yet. We are currently working 
with internal and external stakeholders to set the goals, roadmaps and actions that will 
push us forwards on our journey. You will 
see many of these goals in this report, but some are not ready to share yet. 
What’s your role in the goal-setting  
process?
Together with my colleagues in the Global 
Sustainability Department, I lead the goal-setting process for 100% circularity. 
That means we set the direction and ambi -
tion level, and ensure we are on the right 
track from an environmental and business Wherever possible, we follow a science-based approach to goal setting – we want to 
base every decision on facts and data. Cur -
rently, this approach is most valid for goals 
concerning climate change and water use, 
but we are taking an ‘outside in’ perspective 
to understand and thereby mitigate our local and global impact across all areas of action. 
It is also our job to continuously connect with 
our internal and external stakeholders to share progress and get further input. 
Why is a science-based approach so  
critical?
Leading the change towards a circular fashion 
industry means running our business in a way that is in line with what our planet can afford. 
A science-based approach helps us collabo -
ratively and transparently work with experts 
to define priorities and targets consistent 
with these planetary boundaries, see box 
on p. 37. It pushes us to increase our pace of innovation, make the big leaps that are neces -
sary and set our long-term goals. 
Much of the science in this area is still evolv -
ing. That means we need to keep exploring to 
find the best solutions for our business and the planet. One example for how science helps our goal setting is our research project with the 
Stockholm Resilience Centre and the Ellen 
MacArthur Foundation. Together, we are working to identify what a circular fibre sys -
tem within planetary boundaries could look like for the textile industry. The outcomes of this long-term project will influence what 
material-use goals we set for ourselves, 
and provide guidance for the whole textile industry. 
How important is it to work with  
external stakeholders when it comes  
to goal setting?
I believe it’s very important. Our external stakeholders inspire and challenge us,  
and push us in the right direction. When  
it comes to circularity, we have the privilege of working with some of the most influential 
stakeholders in the field including the  
Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the Stockholm 
Resilience Centre and the WWF.Interview with Cecilia Strömblad Brännsten: Our science-based goal setting explained
perspective. We also work to facilitate cross-functional goal setting – many of our 
targets will only be achieved if different 
functions across our business are aligned. To realise our vision, we also need to con -
tinuously revise our ambition level – and set new goals that push us forward.Vision & StrategyVISION & STRATEGYMESSAGE FROM OUR CEO / KEY FACTS & FIGURES 2016 / OUR VISION / OUR STRATEGY / Q&A WITH THE HEAD OF SUSTAINABILITY / OUR CHANGE-MAKING PROGRAMME  / HOW WE ARE ORGANISED / IMPACTS ALONG OUR VALUE CHAIN

How we are organised
Our head of sustainability, reports 
directly to our CEO and has responsi-

Twice a year, our CEO, CFO and head of 
sustainability review the progress made. 
With the same frequency, our head of 
sustainability reports performance against key sustainability indicators  
to our Board of Directors.
At our head office, our global sustaina -
bility department consists of more than 
25 colleagues responsible for setting the strategic directions and ambition level, 
reviewing our progress, and supporting 
and advising all relevant departments on the development and implementation of 
our strategy. At the group functions and brands, we 
have approximately 15 colleagues. They 
have set specific sustainability goal and 
targets. Their performance is measured and follows the same procedure as for 
any other goal. 
In our production markets, we have 
approximately 145 sustainability manag -
ers that operate from 21 local production 
offices around the world. They work 
directly with our commercial business 
partners to assess their performance against our Sustainability Commitment 
and support them in making improve -

In our sales markets, we have 35 sus -
tainability managers who support the 
implementation of our strategy across  
all of our sales markets.
We have 220 colleagues globally 
who work with sustainability as their core task.

OUR CHALLENGE Processing raw mate -
rials such as cotton is an area we must 
pay close attention to. It involves high 
water and chemical use, and it is often associated with poor working conditions. 
There is a potential risk of child and 
forced labour, and concerns around land rights issues (identified as salient human 
rights issues for us). There are also con -
siderable traceability challenges as we 
do not always have full insight on where 
our conventional cotton comes from. Our 
choices matter, which is why we work to use raw materials as efficiently as pos -
sible, making and promoting sustain -
able raw material choices and working towards our 100% circular ambition. OUR CHALLENGE Sustainability 
starts at the drawing board. We need to 
create fashion without compromising on 
design, quality, price or sustainability. Our choice of materials and our designs 
impact the environment and the people 
who make and wear our clothes. We can make our impact more positive, for 
example, by choosing sustainable mate -
rials and reducing what ends up on the 
cutting room floor. OUR CHALLENGE When our business 
partners buy yarn and fabric, we need to consider water use (a salient human 
rights issue for us), chemical use, work -
ing conditions and greenhouse gas emissions. Generally speaking, we do not 
have direct business relationships with mills. Instead, we work with organisa -
tions such as Solidaridad and the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC) to help mills improve their performance. We have already integrated fabric and 
yarn mills that are involved in making 
about 56% of our products into our sup -
plier assessment system.Design Raw materialsFabric and yarn  
productionOur value chain is connected 
to countless people, communi -
ties, ecosystems and other busi -
nesses around the world – that is what it means to be part of the 
global economy. Our business’ 
social, environmental and eco -
nomic impact is significant and 
far-reaching, and we want it to 
be as positive as possible.
This means creating positive change 
along our value chain – from the farms and factories that supply us to our mil -
lions of customers. We can do this in our own operations, but what about the parts of the value chain that lie outside of our 
direct control? Our strategy is grounded 
on the idea that we must use the size and scale of our business to leverage change 
and create maximum positive impact  
and minimum negative impact. One par -
ticular focus area is the protection and improvement of human rights along our value chain. This is explained in full in 
the Standards & Policies chapter on p. 92. CLIMATE

OUR CHALLENGE We have over 4,351 
stores across 64 markets. As we grow, enter 
new markets and employ new people, we 
need to keep living up to our values and ensure an inspiring and healthy working 
environment. Discrimination and harass -
ment are human rights issues and our inter -
nal policies, such as our Global Diversity, Inclusion and Equality Policy and Non-  
Harassment Policy, are vital to ensure a good 
workplace. Our customers rightfully expect 
good quality products and shopping experi -
ences. As part of that, we need to ensure  
the privacy of their and our colleagues’ data,  
and to advertise in a responsible way. OUR CHALLENGE Over 1.6 million peo -
ple work in the factories of our business partners, 65% of whom are women. Social 
security, wages, freedom of association and collective bargaining, health and 
safety, and working hours are all salient 
human rights issues. Our industry must ensure fair living wages, reductions in 
overtime and workplace safety to become 
socially sustainable. OUR CHALLENGE Caring for clothes 
at home represents about 18% of the 
greenhouse gas emissions in a garment’s 
life. Our challenge is to create afforda -
ble fashion that our customers will love 
from season to season and that is easy 
to care for in a low-impact way. We need to inspire our customers to be more 
conscious in the way they care for their 
garments and make it easy for them to not let fashion end up in landfills. OUR CHALLENGE Transport repre -
sents approximately 2% of the green -
house gas emissions in a garment’s lifecycle. By choosing the right modes  of transport, we can reduce this impact 
even further. And as an important  
customer of the transport companies  
we work with, we have the opportunity  
to influence their awareness and action  
on environmental issues as well. Check out where in the world  
the different stages of our value chain take  
place on an interactive world map here .
* Climate impacts are based on a scope 3 assessment made by Ecofys in 2016, based on 2014 data. Calculations in the footprint analysis are based on a combination of good quality H&M group data (2014 material usage) combined with best available public data sources 
on CO 2 emissions. We are working to further improve the calculations by using primary data from our main suppliers. The water footprint is based on the Water Footprint Network’s methodology and includes green, blue and grey water footprints. Deviation from 100% 
due to rounding effects.** For more information about our social impact, see p. 114. A number of these issues related also to the H&M group’s salient human rights issues, i.e. those human rights at risk of the most severe impact across our operations and supply chain.

As leaders, we want to push bound -

role is to bring people and partners 
together to identify opportunities for new kinds of collaboration. On top of 
this, we aim to proactively seek out 
and share the innovative ideas and solutions that will move our industry

we can accelerate change and speed 
 “  We need to change how fashion 
is currently made and used. ”100% Leading the change
Our sustainability strategy has three focus areas: 100% Leading the change,  
100% Circular & Renewable and 100% Fair & Equal. Real, lasting change  
comes when we approach these areas in a holistic way and find areas of overlap.  
In particular, our approach to leadership must be applied to our work in  
100% Circular & Renewable and 100% Fair & Equal. 
One example of the effectiveness of this approach is our work on water steward -
ship. Working collaboratively with the WWF, our strategy addresses both the fair 
and equal issues around water (such as livelihoods and access) and the circular and renewable issues (such as wastewater, water basin levels and local environments). This has involved working with a full range of stakeholders, most significantly local communities, NGOs and governments. Our chapter on water stewardship goes into more depth on p. 51.up progress towards a truly sustaina -
ble fashion industry. We want to lead 
by example. 
This leadership approach is core to 
our strategy and will empower us to 
fulfil our vision of a 100% Circular & Renewable and 100% Fair & Equal 
fashion industry.To lead the fashion industry towards our sustainability vision, we have 
identified three key drivers that will accelerate progress: innovation, 
transparency and rewarding sustain -
able action. When we apply these 
drivers to our vision and goals, they 
help us accelerate change, empower 
and encourage our stakeholders (including our customers) in making 
sustainable choices and develop new 
solutions to complex challenges. 
Collaboration is fundamental to suc -
cessful leadership and the challenges 
we face are too great to solve alone. 
A full list of key collaborations is pro -
vided at the end of the 100% Circular

Promote and scale innovation
Our approach to innovation
To achieve the kind of transformative 
change our industry needs, we must 
do more than make incremental 
improvements to how fashion is made and used. Instead, we need to take 
leaps. Innovation is the key to this and 
we have a unique opportunity to not only identify and promote innovation, 
but also use our size to take any 
breakthroughs to scale. Our goals are ambitious, so our approach must be, too.
We see innovation as a tool that can keep unlock -
ing sustainable change over the long term. We are 
already aware of some major challenges to achiev -
ing our goals. For example, we need to find a way 
to sustainably recycle blended fibres and develop 
technologies that can capture carbon. We will 
continue to innovate to address these challenges. Looking ahead, we will inevitably encounter many 
more unpredictable challenges along our journey 
that will require solutions we do not yet have. By allocating resources now and by creating collabora -
tive platforms for innovation – both internally and externally – we will build the skills and capacity to tackle these challenges as they arise. –  We focus . We target a clear area – such as becom -
ing Climate Positive – and come up with a plan for getting there. Any gaps in the plan are where we focus our innovation resources.
–  We identify and promote any promising innova -
tions through ongoing dialogue with universities 
and research centres, through our supplier and 
business partnerships and through our connec -
tion with platforms like the Global Change Award.
–  We collaborate . Through our extensive network of 
partners, we identify and facilitate the opportu -
nities for collaborative innovation that will speed our progress towards our goals and, wherever possible, lead the way for the rest of the industry 
to do the same. 
–  We scale . The size of our business means we can 
take successful innovations to scale quickly, for 
example, by introducing new sustainable materi -
als in our supply chain.
Alongside this, we also have CO:LAB, an internal investment team with a mission to promote entre -
preneurship, explore and challenge the future of fashion and support the long-term growth of the H&M group. CO:LAB makes investments in sus -
tainable fashion, innovative business models and technology enablers, and looks for companies with a strategic match to our business.100% LEADING THE CHANGEOVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / PROMOTE AND SCALE INNOVATION  / DRIVE TRANSPARENCY / REWARD SUSTAINABLE ACTIONS

Here are some examples of how we  
use this approach to help tackle our  
100% Circular & Renewable ambition.
First, we focus on a challenge. We want 
to increase the lifespan of our garments, 
for example, by facilitating secondary use. In November 2015, we identified the 
potential of Sellpy, a Swedish start-up 
that offers an on-demand service to help people sell items they no longer use. We 
invested in Sellpy to help them develop 
and scale their sustainable retail con -
cept – a new and exciting way to shop 
that aligns well with our own business 
concept of fashion and quality at the  best price in a sustainable way. 
We are also focusing on developing 
methods to recycle a much larger  
percentage of products, particularly 
garments. When a garment is no longer usable, recycling is usually the best 
option – ideally into products of the same 
or higher value. Because the technology doesn’t exist for this to happen, we are 
working to increase the share of products 
that can be recycled by creating demand for further innovation, and by identifying 
and investing in several exciting ideas. 
In 2016, our collaboration with the inno -
vation company Worn Again saw some promising technologies in development 
for textile-to-textile recycling. Similarly, 
our work with the Cradle-to-Cradle 
Products Innovation Institute is helping support industry-wide demand and sup -
ply of sustainable materials. 
In addition to our own initiatives, the inde -
pendent non-profit H&M Foundation aims 
to drive change throughout the industry. For example, the Global Change Award 
is one of the world’s largest competitions 
for early-stage innovation, providing grants of EUR 1 million annually (see 
p. 26). The H&M Foundation receives 
the proceeds of our garment collecting initiative (almost EUR 0.8 million) for 
circular innovation. The H&M group also 
supports Global Change Award winners with knowledge about the fashion indus -
try and the supply chain. This and more is covered in detail in our 100% Circular & Renewable chapter on p. 54.The Global Change Award is an innovation challenge initiated by the non-profit H&M 
Foundation in 2015. By catalysing green, truly 
ground-breaking ideas, the Global Change Award takes on one of the biggest challenges 
facing today’s fashion industry – creating fash -
ion for a growing population while improving 
its impact on the environment. 
Each year, an expert panel annually selects 
five winners that share a grant of EUR 1 mil -
lion and gain access to a one-year innovation accelerator provided by the H&M Founda -
tion, Accenture and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. 
The global public is invited to distribute the 
EUR 1 million grant between the five inno -
vations through an online vote. The result of 
the vote and the innovators are revealed at 
a grand award ceremony held in Stockholm in April. This is one of the world’s biggest 
challenges for early-stage innovation and the 
first such initiative in the fashion industry. 
The H&M Foundation introduced the 
challenge to speed up this process for the entire fashion industry and neither the H&M 
Foundation nor the H&M group claim any equity or intellectual property rights in the 
innovations. The aim is to influence the fash -
ion industry as a whole.
The H&M Foundation is a non-profit global 
foundation privately funded by the Stefan 
Persson family, founders and main owners of the H&M group. Since 2013, the family has 
donated 1.1 billion Swedish kronor (USD 154 
million/EUR 123 million) to the Foundation.  
The mission is to drive long lasting positive 
change and improve living conditions by investing in people, communities and innova -
tive ideas. This is done through partnerships within four focus areas: Education, Water, Equality and Planet.

Creating a more accountable 
and transparent supply chain
100% Leading the change
As an important accelerator of change, 
transparency is key to building trust 
and credibility along our supply chain 
and empowering our customers to make more sustainable choices.
Transparency is about knowing how and where 
our products are made and being open and honest 
about it. Transparency allows us to hold ourselves 
and our suppliers accountable on issues such as human rights, fair jobs and environmental protec -
tion. And it means we can pinpoint priorities, take appropriate action and communicate with confi -
dence and credibility about our progress. Greater 
transparency also makes it possible for our cus -
tomers to make more sustainable choices, which is 
essential to driving and accelerating change.
Transparency is also critical to achieving our 100% 
Fair & Equal and 100% Circular & Renewable ambi -
tions. For example, it helps us identify and favour suppliers who pay their employees a fair living wage, monitor and manage material and chemical 
use much more effectively, and communicate more 
clearly with our customers about the issues they care about.Transparency is a complex issue. Building a system 
for transparency along a fashion supply chain takes 
time and a lot of collaboration. It involves finding a way to track and store information about raw mate -
rials and then connecting it to specific products. The complexity of the industry makes this harder, as does the fact that neither we nor our competitors 
have a direct business relationship with many of our 
second and third tier suppliers. What’s more, there is always some industry-wide tension around the 
balance between transparency and competitiveness.
However, we are serious about transparency and 
– despite the challenges – are making good pro -
gress towards it. We were the first fashion retailer 
to make our supplier list public (in 2013) and we 
are collecting more and more in-depth produc -
tion information to share with our customers and 
other stakeholders. This includes information from 
factories that are subcontracted by our suppliers 
for specific tasks such as washing, embroidery and printing. In 2016, we continued to expand our 
public supplier factory list to include second tier 
factories. It now includes the fabric and yarn mills that made about 56% of our products in 2016. 
We will continue to lead the change when it comes 
to transparency. However, we have learned that 
increased transparency typically also increases

external scrutiny and criticism. Despite 
this, we are committed to transparency 
because we believe it is what the indus -
try needs. However, we also hope that it 
will become more valued in the future to 
encourage companies to be more open.
THE SUSTAINABLE APPAREL  
COALITION AND HIGG INDEX
The Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) is an industry-wide alliance between 
stakeholders working towards sustain -
able production. As one of the founding 
members of the SAC, we share our com -
mitment to drive transparency across the fashion industry with those partners who are most capable of creating change. 
For more information, see the interview 
with the CEO of the SAC on p. 30.
The Higg Index is the main output of the 
SAC. It’s a suite of self-assessment and verification tools across three modules  
– brand, facility and product – that helps 
assess the sustainability performance of a brand, product, material or individ -ual facility (such as a factory). The Higg Index measures environmental, social 
and labour impacts, presents a score 
and identifies areas for improvement. We were one of the first global fashion 
companies to roll out the facility module 
of the Higg Index to all of our first tier factories. We also rolled out the module 
to our second tier factories that represent 
56% of the H&M group’s total business volume. (The product module is not yet 
finished and we are using the brand 
module for internal purposes). 
We hope that this will inspire other 
brands to follow suit – if we are all in the same system, we can create a universal 
standard to compare the sustainability 
of products, brands and suppliers using the same bar. This brings many advan -
tages. Consumers can make sustainable choices more easily. Brands and suppliers can identify their strengths and devel -
opment areas more easily and there -
fore focus on the right improvements. What’s more, when a supplier only has to complete one assessment rather than meeting the demands of various indi -
vidual brands, they free up resources for putting those improvements in practice.
We also score each supplier factory’s 
sustainability performance through our own set of defined KPIs and Higg 
Index questions. We use the output of 
this to create our Sustainability Index (SI), which replaced our Code of Conduct 
Index in 2015. Currently, we use the SI 
to give us a broader view of the sustain -
ability impacts and performance of our 
suppliers, therefore giving us greater 
visibility and insight. 
Over the last few years, we have devel -
oped a supplier assessment programme 
called the SIPP – the Sustainable Impact 
Partnership Programme. This is based 
on the Higg Index facility module as well as our own KPIs (for now). Through the SIPP, we aim to drive sup -
plier ownership, reward the extra mile, 
measure performance beyond com -
pliance and reflect that sustainability 
drives business performance. We explain 
the SIPP and its process and progress in 
more detail in the Standards & Policies chapter on p. 100. 
Our ongoing progress towards greater 
transparency will help us improve our goal setting. As we collect more and 
better information about our impact and 
our supply chain, we will be able to set more ambitious and effective goals. For 
example, greater transparency will help 
us achieve our initial goal to have full traceability of all of our cotton by 2020. 
 “  Our ongoing progress towards 
greater transparency will help us improve goal setting.

customers100% Leading the change
At the other end of our value chain, one 
of our key transparency goals concerns 
communication with our customers. The 
Higg Index is a tool used to measure the sustainability performance of apparel 
and footwear. Not only will this drive 
sustainability performance across our entire industry, we ultimately want to 
translate it into a product labelling sys -
tem that allows customers to benchmark 
products across brands. We support the 
SAC’s vision of completing the consumer 
facing index by 2020.Case study: Environmental score 
labels on our footwear
Transparency is a key driver of progress. 
That’s why we were excited to be part of 
a pilot programme that explored how to 
give customers more information about the lifecycle impact of products – in this 
instance, shoes. This included everything 
from the raw materials we use and how we transport our products to their poten -
tial use and disposal.  The European Commission piloted this ini -
tiative, which was then run by the Sustain -
able Apparel Coalition (SAC) and several other brands including Nike, Adidas and 
Zara. Working together, we created a 
methodology to calculate the footprint from each shoe and a communication 
format that delivered clear, practical 
information. We want our customers to know that our products are made with 
care for the environment and allow them 
to compare sustainability performance – even between brands.
 
The new hang tag used a rating system from A to E, which was developed by the 
SAC, participating brands and independ -
ent experts. We entered four models of 
women’s shoes into the pilot, all of which 
scored A or B. 
 The pilot finished in autumn 2016. Looking 
ahead, the SAC will use its findings to 
grow our shared understanding of how to assess the impact from products and how 
to communicate that impact in a way that 
informs our customers and drives sustain-ability across our industry. The European 
Commission will evaluate the results of the 
pilot in 2017 and then make a recommen -
dation to the European Parliament.In 2016, the H&M group collaborated with Control Union on a pilot traceability 
system for organic cotton and viscose. 
We developed a web-based system that allowed suppliers to record incoming 
and outgoing shipments and provide 
transaction records and a QR code for each one. Selected suppliers from all 
tiers were trained to use the system for 
this pilot, which enabled fibre to gar -
ment traceability. The pilot was a success 
and we now plan to scale up the system 
to cover the entire viscose supply chain over the next few years.
“  We want our 
customers to know that our products are made with care for the environ -
ment.

Stakeholder interview with the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC)
The Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) is an alliance between 
members of the apparel, footwear and home textile industries. 
The H&M group was a founding member of the SAC and we 
share in its vision of a sustainable fashion industry that does not harm the environment and has a positive impact on the people 
and communities connected to it. We talked to Jason Kibbey, 
CEO, about the value of transparency for a more sustainable future of fashion.
How does the SAC improve the trans -
parency and sustainability performance 
of brands and their suppliers?

these lenses generates a Higg sustainabil -
ity score. While these scores are currently only used in a business-to-business con-text, eventually they will be available to all 
stakeholders including consumers.
When can we expect all of the social 
and environmental data to be publicly 
available?According to our roadmap, all of this informa -
tion will be available by 2020, if not before.
What are the biggest challenges to push 
for an even greater adoption of the  
Higg Index?Getting an entire industry to use one 
assessment tool takes time and patience, 
but we’re making good progress. Our 
members and their value chains have so far performed nearly 15,000 brand and facility 
assessments. All SAC members, which 
comprise nearly 40% of the industry, will be required to use the Higg Index.
What are you hoping to achieve in  
the next five years?
First, we want product-level transparency 
for apparel and footwear to become 
a reality for all stakeholders, including 
consumers. This will allow them to choose products according to their sustainabil -
ity performance. And second, we want there to be measurable positive social and environmental impact in the apparel and 
footwear value chain.What do you see as the H&M group’s 
biggest sustainability challenges in 
the coming years?  
The H&M group and all large retailers 
will have to find a way to continue to 
grow while dramatically reducing their 
environmental and social footprint. The solution is to become circular, but that’s 
a big challenge.

There is a lot of research out there into how to 
encourage sustainable mindsets and empower sus -
tainable behaviour. We want people to do the right thing and believe they should be rewarded for posi -
tive behaviour. We know that incentives and reward 
systems can change behaviours for the better in the 
long term. This principle is true for all of our poten -
tial changemakers – from customers to suppliers.
Our approach is to reward sustainable actions and 
choices in a way that integrates sustainability into 
decision-making for our colleagues, customers and 
partners. For example, we choose and reward part -
ners who share our values and are willing to work 
transparently with us to improve their social and 
environmental performance. To fulfil our sustainability goals, we 
have to build sustainability into every 
decision taken at every step of our value 
chain from farmers and factory owners to our customers.
It is our ambition to develop and use 
reward systems that can best create 
and accelerate progress towards our 
sustainability goals and vision. We will use different reward systems for 
different groups and situations.
COLLEAGUES
We have integrated sustainability 
goals in our business goals. This forms part of our regular manage -
ment evaluation process and it will 
be followed up regularly to create accountability and to reward good 
performance.
We will encourage colleagues at all 
levels to contribute to change in the 
workplace and in their communities. This will involve a range of activities 
and strategies, some of which are still 
in development. 
CUSTOMERS
We know that incentives create pos -
itive behavioural change so we will 
use them to inspire our customers to love their clothes for longer and 
reuse and recycle wherever possible. 
We already reward customers who 
recycle their clothes via our garment collection initiative and through the 
H&M Club.
COMMERCIAL PARTNERSWe will work with our partners 
to raise environmental and social standards. Our Sustainable Impact 
Partnership Programme (SIPP), see 
p. 100, will help with this. We will reward partners who maintain a 
good sustainability performance and 
aspire to further improve it with more orders, training opportunities and 
more long-term contracts. In this way, 
we will support partners in raising environmental and social standards 
across the industry as a whole.100% LEADING THE CHANGEOVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / PROMOTE AND SCALE INNOVATION / DRIVE TRANSPARENCY / REWARD SUSTAINABLE ACTIONS

Our planet sustains us, but our global demand for resources is 
outstripping supply. Today, it would take 1.5 planets to support our 
lifestyles. If we continue along the same track, we will need the 
equivalent of 2.3 planets by 2050.* In part, this is because the global middle class is expected to increase by over three billion people in 
the next two decades, which will inevitably lead to an increase in 
consumer demand. And, like today, everyone will want clothes that keep them warm and dry as well as help them express who they are 
and what they stand for.
This is the job that fashion performs. 
Today, fashion is a huge, complex industry 
but at its core, it’s still about turning raw 
materials (such cotton grown on a farm) into products. Our customers buy the 
products they like, use them, and then 
dispose of them when the time is right.
This system is known as a linear model 
and it is the norm for nearly every other industry. But, looking ahead, this model 
is placing increasingly unsustainable 
demands on our world. It uses up too many natural resources, and does it in 
a way that disrupts our environment. 
If we want our industry (not to mention our planet) to survive and for people to consume in a sustainable way, we must rethink how our products are made  
and enjoyed. 
The solution is to bring about a global 
shift from a linear to a circular system. In 
a circular model, resources stay in use for as long as possible, before being recov -
ered and regenerated into new products and materials. This is the only way our industry will be able to operate to its 
fullest potential, while staying within our 
planet’s boundaries. See box on p. 37. 
There is also a strong business case for 
the H&M group to make this shift. For example, the price of raw materials is 100% Circular & Renewable

A group of scientists* has developed a con -
cept to help us understand the complex and 
interlinked ecological systems that sustain 
life on earth. Using this concept, the group has proposed a framework of nine ‘plane -
tary boundaries’ that define a safe operating space for humanity. Each boundary is set at a ‘safe’ distance from a dangerous level 
or potential ‘tipping point’ and include, for 
example, fresh water use, biodiversity loss and species extinction, and climate change.
The scientist report that if we stay within 
these boundaries, life on earth has a good 
chance of continuing as usual. But if we cross them, we risk abrupt and irreversible 
environmental changes that could be very 
damaging or even catastrophic for society. Because of human activity, we have already 
crossed four out of nine boundaries, and we

At the H&M group, part of our sustainability strategy is to become 
100% circular and renewable. By decoupling the growth of our 
business from our resource use, we can continue to provide good, 
fair jobs and sustainable products for millions of people for years to come. And we can help bring about a similar shift across the rest 
of our industry.
To achieve this, we are taking a holis -
tic approach to becoming circular and 
renewable. This means rethinking how we 
design and make our products (including our water, chemical and energy use), what 
materials we choose, and how our custom -
ers use and dispose of them. This holistic 
approach also means finding ways to sig -
nificantly reduce our climate impact. Our goal is to achieve a Climate Positive Value Chain – an entire value chain that creates 
a net positive impact on the climate by 
2040. See more on p. 57.
We also need to create new and stronger 
partnerships, and continue collaborating with stakeholders along our value chain – 
including our suppliers and our customers. 
Together, we will need to find innovative solutions to key challenges including how 
to fully recycle blended fabrics and how to 
help our suppliers access renewable energy and minimise their environmental foot -print. Many of our key partnerships will help us address complex issues that con -
nect to multiple focus areas. For example, our strategic collaboration with the WWF addresses both climate and water issues.
GOALS
As explained in our Vision & Strategy 
chapter, we are working with experts – 
both internally and externally – to set goals that keep pushing us towards 100% 
circularity and, wherever possible, we are 
following a science-based approach to define our targets and actions. 
Goal-setting is an ongoing process. These 
goals represent the initial key milestones 
along the way to achieving our vision of 
100% Circular & Renewable on a global group level.

Stakeholder interview with Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute
What does Cradle to Cradle mean,  
and how does it connect to a circular 
economy?
The circular economy is based on the concept of keeping products – and their 
constituent materials – within a continuous, 
regenerative cycle of use and reuse. Cradle to Cradle design, and, in turn, the Cradle 
to Cradle certified product standard, offer 
a continuous improvement process for product design and manufacturing to help 
companies innovate and make materials  
and products for the circular economy. 
What is Fashion+?
Fashion+ is a collective of brands, designers and suppliers who are working together 
to identify, optimise and innovate materi -als for use in the fashion industry, verify 
those materials according to the Cradle to Cradle Certified product standard, then 
make those materials available for fashion 
industry use. 
How does a product standard become  
a positive force for society and the environment?  
By using Cradle to Cradle Certified for responsible product design, Fashion+ members are helping reduce demand 
for natural resources, ensuring the use of 
healthy materials, and bring about positive change in the way fashion is consumed. 
What are the key Cradle to Cradle chal -
lenges for the fashion industry? 
Identifying materials that meet Cradle to 
Cradle standards and can also deliver on aesthetics, performance and other qualities 
is one. Another is scaling the systems that 
can separate fibre types and upcycle them into new material streams. Name  Lewis Perkins

Choosing more  
recycled or sustaina -
bly sourced materials 
for our products is another vital step 
to become 100% circular and close the loop on fashion. We have been working with recycled and sustain -
ably sourced materials for many years. In the 90s, H&M sold one-off collections using organically grown cotton and in 2004, we began selling 
garments made from certified organic 
cotton in certain baby and children’s garments. Today, we are one of the 
biggest users of recycled and sustain -
ably sourced materials*, all of which 
are third-party certified.** According 
to the Textile Exchange Preferred 
Fiber Market Report, the H&M group 
is the world’s second biggest user of 
organic cotton, recycled polyester  
and Lyocell and largest user of 
responsibly sourced down. According 
to the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), we are the biggest user in volume of 
Better Cotton.
* textileexchange.org **  Depending on the type of sustainable materials, we are certified to a relevant sustainable material standard such as, OCS, GOTS, GRS, RCS, RDS, RWS, 
by a third party such as Control Union, Ecocert, ICEA, IMO.STAGE B  
Our choice of materialRECYCLED MATERIALS
Recycled material is made from a 
waste product, such as old textiles, 
production waste or used PET bot -
tles. By using recycled material, we 
can reduce the amount of waste (e.g. 
old textiles) that go to landfill, the use of virgin raw materials and the 
che micals, energy and water used 
in raw material production. We use a wide range of recycled materials at 
the H&M group including recycled 
cotton, polyester, wool, cashmere and plastic. In the long term, we want to 
turn all products that can no longer 
be used into new materials and products. Today, this is not possible 
because the technology for recycling 
is limited. For this reason, the share of recycled materials in our products 
is still relatively small.
SUSTAINABLY SOURCED MATERIALS
Sustainably sourced textile materi -
als can either be grown naturally or 
cultivated, but must also be renew -
able through natural processes within a reasonable amount of time. Sustainably sourced materials 
should also have the potential to be 
recycled. The sustainability profile of sustainably sourced materials must be verified as better by a third party 
(e.g. through a Life Cycle Assessment 
report, Higg MSI Tool , or MADE-BY 
fibre benchmark ).
To accelerate our journey towards recycled or other sustainably sourced 
materials we are creating demand for 
solutions and working with innova -
tors and scientists, including Worn 
Again, the HKRITA and the Circular 
Innovation Working Group that aim to close the loop and enable recycling 
of all types of textile fibres. See more 
on p. 43.
We use a wide range of sustainably 
sourced materials, including organic materials such as cotton, linen, hemp, 
jute and silk, Tencel®Lyocell and 
third-party certified down, rubber, wood, Better Cotton and wool.Case study: The HK 
Research Institute of  
Textiles and Apparel 
(HKRITA)
In addition to the H&M group initiatives, the 
non-profit H&M Foundation and The Hong 
Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel 
(HKRITA) have entered a four-year partnership to develop the required technologies to recycle 
blended textiles into new fabrics and yarns.
The technology will be licensed widely to ensure 
broad market access and maximum impact. 
Apparel and textile products made from blended materials account for a high proportion of all 
textiles and apparel in the market today. And yet 
no commercially viable separation, sorting or recycling technologies are available for many of 
the most popular materials, such as cotton and 
polyester blends.
This work is being financed through the surplus 
income from our garment collecting initiative.

Our goal is to use 100% recycled or other 
sustainably sourced materials by 2030*. 
 
In 2016, 26% of our total materials fit this description. As we move towards our 
goal, we will focus on prioritising the use 
of recycled materials and complement -
ing them with materials that have been 
sustainably sourced. 
– We need to understand how to make 
better choices about the materials we 
use and understand their impact – from farm and factory to customer use. To get 
this insight, we used LCA** data when 
evaluating materials, together with third party verified data (such as the MadeBy 
fibre benchmark or the Higg Materials 
Sustainability Index ***).
– We are collaborating with the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute on a project called Fashion+. This brings 
together brands, designers and suppliers 
to identify, optimise and innovate sus -

industry, and then work to make them Choosing only recycled or 
other sustainably sourced 
materialswidely available. See more in the inter -
view with the Institute on p. 42.
– In 2016, we also initiated a research 
project with the Ellen MacArthur  
Foundation and Stockholm Resilience 
Centre that looks at how a circular textile fibre industry can operate within plane -
tary boundaries. This collaboration also supports our ambition to use a science- based approach in all our sustainability 
work.
– We are the second largest user of recy -
cled polyester. In 2016, we used recycled 
polyester equivalent to more than 180 million PET bottles. Recycled polyester is 
made from PET – the same material as in 
clear plastic water bottles – and requires significantly fewer chemicals and less 
energy and water to make. Recycling 
these bottles also prevents them from going to landfill.
– We are the second largest user of 
Tencel®Lyocell (also known as Lyo -

Case study: Setting the 
standard for wool
Wool is an amazing fibre. It’s incredibly strong 
and insulating, and our customers love to wear 
it. It represents only about 1% of our total fibre 
use, but it is still important that we source it in a responsible way – and that we encourage other 
brands to do the same.
In 2014, after failing to find a global animal 
welfare standard for wool, we contacted the 
Textile Exchange to see if they were interested in leading the development of a global wool 
standard in collaboration with us, and other 
brands and stakeholders. Two years later, the Textile Exchange launched the Responsible Wool 
Standard (RWS) – the only global animal welfare 
standard developed specifically for wool.
The RWS aims to improve animal welfare, incen -
tivise best practice and ensure full traceability 
in wool production. We are now working to get 
RWS-certified wool into our own supply chain. 
Our goal is to use 100% RWS-certified wool in  
all of our products by 2022.ANIMAL-BASED MATERIALSBecause we use some animal-based materials in our products, animal 
welfare is an important part of our 
sustainable sourcing strategy. We are committed to having a positive 
impact on animal welfare, both in our 
value chain and across the entire tex -
tile industry. Our long-term ambition 
is to achieve full traceability for all 
of our animal-derived materials and only source from responsible farms 
with good animal husbandry. For 
example, through our work with the Responsible Down Standard and the 
Responsible Wool Standard, we can 
ensure that we source these materi -
als in a sustainable way. We are also 
actively looking for new, innovative 
non-animal alternatives. 
Besides using animal-based materi -
als in our products, we also believe 
that no animals should be used for 
testing of cosmetics, and we do not 
accept animal testing on any cosmetic products, either during production or 
on finished products
Down
– According to the Textile Exchange’s 
Preferred Fiber Market Report 2016, the H&M group is the world’s largest user of down certified by the Respon -
sible Down Standard (RDS). 
– From January 2016, 100% of the 
down in our products has been 
RDS-certified.
Wool
– In 2016, we helped develop the 
Responsible Wool Standard in a pro -
ject led by the Textile Exchange. We 
are now working to get RWS-certified 
wool into our supply chain. See case study p. 46.
– 100% of our key second tier suppli -
ers (which covers 70% of our product 
volume in wool) have been briefed on 
the new responsible wool standard. 
– Approximately 25% of our second 
tier spinners have completed the Con -
tent Claim Standard (CCS)* for RWS.
 
LeatherTogether with the industry, we want 
to work towards a more transpar -
ent leather supply chain. Our long-
term goal is to use only leather from 
known and well-managed sources 
that act on environmental, social and animal welfare issues. Looking ahead, our work will now focus both on closer integration of leather tan -
neries into our supply chain manage -
ment systems and improved material traceability and to collaborate with 
others to long-term secure the entire 
leather supply chain, all the way down to the farm level. In parallel, 
we will keep exploring innovative 
non-animal leather materials that have all the benefits of leather, but 
none of the risks.
– In 2016, we began integrating tan -
neries into our sustainability assess -
ments, covering social and environ -
mental requirements. All tanneries 
that supply the H&M group must 
comply with our chemical require -
ments.

Stakeholder interview with the Textile Exchange
We spoke to Anne Gillespie, Director of 
Industry Integrity, about the Responsible Wool 
Standard (RWS) and the H&M group. 
What are the most challenging animal  
welfare issues facing the fashion  
industry today? 
Animal welfare issues exist in relation to all of 
the Five Freedoms* and the greatest risks vary 
depending on the type of animal and geograph -
ical region. The biggest challenge is to ensure 
that these Five Freedoms are being thoroughly 
and consistently met throughout the supply chain. Long, complex supply chains, multiple 
stakeholders and lack of transparency and 
traceability, make this challenge even harder.
How can a standard like the RWS help  
overcome these challenges?The RWS is a neutral, third-party standard that 
can be used by the entire industry to ensure 
that animal welfare needs are being consist -
ently met. It also provides brands with a pow -
erful way to communicate their expectations along their supply chain right back to the farms. Furthermore, it provides a global benchmark 
for best practice in both animal welfare and 
land management.
What role did the H&M group play develop -
ing the RWS?
The H&M group was the catalyst for the RWS to begin with, and is now the leader in its appli -
cation. By making a strong and public com -
mitment to use certified wool, the H&M group provides a clear goal for other brands, and 
sends a strong signal to farmers and the wool 
industry that this standard is important.
What would you like to see from the  
H&M group in the future in regards to  animal welfare?
The H&M group already has a strong animal wel -
fare policy. I would love to see the H&M group 
make third-party verification of the Five Free -
doms and traceability a goal for all their fibres.

To close the loop on 
fashion, we need all of 
our production processes 
to be sustainable. The third part of our journey 
to a 100% circular and

One of the ways we are doing this is 
through our work with the Zero Dis-
charge of Hazardous Chemicals group 
(ZDHC), which brings brands together to improve chemical management practices. 
Together with other committed ZDHC 
brands we are actively involved with a range of stakeholders (including gov -

– Strong chemical legislation helps 
strengthen our message to our supply 
chain and stakeholders. During 2016,  
we were actively engaged in the EU public consultation** on the restriction of 
certain hazardous substances in textiles 
and clothing. We have also endorsed the restriction of the use of CMR (carcino -
genic, mutagenic, or toxic for reproduc -
tion) substances in consumer products.
– In 2016, we ran a Hazardous Sub -

Water stewardship
As with other natural resources on this 
planet, our access to water is limited. 
Due to our increasingly water-intensive 
lifestyles and rapidly growing popula -
tion, water management is crucial to 
maintain welfare and ecosystems. This 
is particularly true in areas already facing water risks – including South and 
subcontinental Asia, where many of our 
suppliers are based. Our two most signif -
icant water sources for our wet-process 
suppliers are located in areas with high 
water risk on the deltas of Brahmaputra (Bangladesh) and Yangtze (China).
To fulfil our vision of 100% circularity 
and renewability, we must take action 
to manage water responsibly across 
our value chain. We recognise that the biggest impacts come from outside of 
our own operations so, to be effective, 
we must take an integrated approach with local industries and decision makers. 
We have been collaborating with the 
WWF since 2011, and our partnership 
has played a fundamental role in our 
work on water stewardship issues along our value chain.“  To fulfil our vision of 100%  
circularity and renewability, we must take action to  manage water responsibly across our value chain.

OUR APPROACH
Most water strategies focus on how 
much water is used and disposed of. In 
contrast, our approach is connected to holistic water management on the basins 
level. This factors in the sources of water 
that are being drained (which acceler -
ates water scarcity and decreases water 
quality), as well as the local impacts, such 
as depletion of fish stocks and threat to livelihoods. In collaboration with the 
WWF we are exploring the development 
of context based target settings. Fur -
thermore, we have identified access to 
water as a salient human rights* issue, 
since water usage affects people and their livelihoods. Bangladesh Water Multi-Stakeholder Partnership and partners of the 2030 
Water Resources Group, we are trying  
to achieve similar action in Bangladesh.  
We are also supporting a WWF project in Turkey and looking at other areas where 
this kind of approach would be suitable.
The second largest water footprint in our 
value chain comes from customer use. We provide our customers with infor -
mation on climate-friendly was of caring for clothes, to empower them to use less water and change their habits in the 
long-term.
While our operational water impact is 
small compared to the lifecycle impact  
of our products, it still matters. For example, we are installing water-efficient 
equipment across our own operations, 
which will be completed by 2020 (see table on p. 52). We are also harvesting rain 
water and raising awareness amongst 
employees, and we are committed to continually improving the compliance 
rate of our suppliers when it comes to 
wastewater quality requirements.Data is estimated based on data collected  
from wet processing units during 2015.AVERAGE YEARLY WATER WITHDRAWAL PER

Outside of our operations, we are work -

to create the change needed to manage 
water responsibly across our value chain. We are proactively engaging with a broad 
group of stakeholders that goes beyond 
our traditional areas of influence. One of our key aims is to strengthen water 
governance. This includes ensuring that 
regulations are properly monitored and enforced, that water-related government 
bodies have clear mandates and that busi -
nesses, farmers and community members 
are fully included in decision-making on 
water. For example, we are already acting 
on this in China, and, as representatives on the National Steering Board of

The H&M group’s water 
stewardship strategy has 
been developed in line 
with the WWF’s water 
stewardship steps.Water stewardship
We have been collaborating with the 
WWF since 2011 on water stewardship 
issues along our value chain. This collab -
oration has been strengthened over the 
years. During this time we have devel -
oped a strategy for water stewardship that targets the following five key themes:
1. Building water awareness within the 
company, supplier factories and amongst our customers.
2. Measuring water impact and risk 
within our stores, warehouses and sup -
plier factories.
3. Improving the use of water within our 
stores, warehouses and supplier factories.
4. Increased focus on collective action,  
for example, our river basin engagements 
in China.
5. Increased focus on government influ -
ence. We are currently scaling up the 
Industrial Park project from our previ -
ous partnership, as well as bringing in other brands, to further impact water use amongst suppliers in Industrial 
Parks in China.Below are our water actions in 2016 
along our value chain and within our 
own operations: 
– At the beginning of 2016, we renewed 
our WWF partnership for another five 
years. It now also covers climate action and our influence over our industry’s 
broader sustainability challenges.
– We are continuously working with part -
ners to help our fabric producers improve 
their environmental footprint, which also includes water management and impact 
assessment data. In 2016, we worked with 
fabric mills involved in making 56% of our products (2015: 50%, 2014: 35%) in our 
supplier assessment systems. 
– In China, we moved the water steward -
ship programme in the Taihu Basin from 
a pilot into a project. This is a collabo -
ration that proactively engages stake -
holders to improve basin governance. For example, we are engaging with the government on the need to address water 
challenges with improved legislation.

– A total of 8,234 workers were trained in four regions (Bangladesh, China, 
India and Turkey) by the STWI on water, energy and resource efficiency.
– A total of 75 factories participated 
in our cleaner production programme 
through STWI and PaCT partnerships 
n four regions.The cleaner production programme aim is to reduce environ -

tional practices in textile wet processing, particularly excessive groundwater 
extraction and surface water pollution. 
It also includes energy and chemical use. See more on PaCT  and SWTI .
 – In 2016, 82% of our supplier factories were in compliance with the BSR require -
ments (see graph). We apply the Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) Water Group’s quality definitions, which in many 
locations go well beyond legal require -
ments. We have included these standards 
in our Sustainability Commitment with 
the aim to reach full compliance. – Since 2015, we have scored all of our 
denim products using Jeanologia’s 
Environmental Impact Measurement 
tool. This third-party tool helps us and our suppliers measure, set targets and 
reduce water, energy and chemical use in 
our denim production. About half of all our denim products reached the high -

ronmental impact of a 
product comes from its 
‘use phase’. For the H&M group, it is important to 
ensure our products that are used for as long as possible, and that our customers can care for them in a sustainable way. 
Our aim is to avoid waste wherever possi -
ble and minimise what goes to landfill. 
In the long term, we are working hard to find a solution for reusing and recycling 
all textile fibres for new use.
There are a number of ways we can 
influence our customers to act more 
sustainably while using and disposing of our products. This includes provid -
ing information about long-life care, encouraging customers to use products for longer, and empowering them to 
reuse and recycle rather than throw 
away.
CARE AND REPAIR
We help our customers look after their 
clothes in a way that makes them last 100% Circular & Renewable
STAGE D  
Prolonging the lifespan  
of our productslonger and that has a lower impact on 
the environment:
– All of our garments have the Clever 
Care label included in their washing 
instructions. This label provides infor -
mation on how our customers can reduce 
the environmental impact of our prod -
ucts after the garments leave our stores, for example by washing at lower tem -
peratures and by hang drying instead of 
using a tumble dryer. For more informa -
tion, visit:
> clevercare.info
  
– In 2016, we have also launched an 
extended garment care information page 
online. This information helps custom -
ers care for their clothes in a way that 
makes them last longer, including mak -
ing simple repairs and washing less.
REUSE AND RECYCLING
We want to use more materials from the garments we collect in our products. We 
work in several different areas when it 
comes to the reusing and recycling our products. Through our garment collecting 
initiative, we collect unwanted clothes from our customers and give them a new 
life through reuse or recycling. 
– We have invested in the Swedish start-  
up Sellpy, which offers an on-demand 
service that helps people sell clothes and other items online.
– We make and sell products using post 
consumer textile waste and we both 
have regular products and special col -
lections made from collected garments 
in our assortment. For example, the 
H&M brands Close the Loop collection 
launched in September 2016. We also 
upcycle second hand garments into new 
ones with the Cheap Monday Capsule collection. GARMENT COLLECTINGGarment collection is an easy and acces -
sible solution to decrease textile waste and save precious natural resources that works for customers and for our busi -
ness. Our garment collecting initiative is made possible through our global part -
nership with I:CO a solutions provider 
for clothing and shoes reuse and recy -
cling. The H&M brand started collecting 
old clothes and home textiles, from any 
brand and in any conditions, for reuse 
and recycling on a global scale in 2013 in its stores around the world, from any 
brand and in any condition.* Our & Other 
Stories brand also collects product waste in store. See case study on p. 54. 
– We have developed and set a new goal 
for garment collecting in 2016. Our new 
goal is to increase collected volumes to 
reach 25,000 tonnes annually by 2020. In 2016, we collected 15,888 tonnes of 
garments (a 29% increase from 2015 and 
a 107% increase from 2014). Between the start of the initiative and November 
2016, we collected more than 39,000 
tonnes of garments. 
– In April 2016, we ran a campaign called 
World Recycle Week, and beat our target to collect 1,000 tonnes of garments 
globally in a single week. The initiative 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLEOVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / OUR AMBITIONS / 100% CIRCULAR / 100% RENEWABLE / OUR CLIMATE IMPACT / KEY COLLABORATIONS

allowed us to speak directly with our 
customers about how they dispose 
of their clothes and raise awareness 
about why avoiding landfill through reuse and recycling is important and 
necessary. This is just one part of the 
puzzle to reduce the amount of cloth -
ing that end up in landfill.
– We continued to donate all of the 
surplus income from our garment 
collection programme to the H&M 
Foundation, which split it between projects focused on equality and 
inclusion of marginalised groups, 
and recycling research with he Hong Kong Research Institute of 
Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA). 
Between 2013 and November 2016, we collected almost 39,000 tonnes, 
which resulted in donations of EUR 
780,000. Examples of these include:
–  The social projects, initiated by the H&M Foundation focus on improving equality and inclusion 
of people in marginalised groups. 
In addition, for each kg of textiles that the H&M group collects,  
EUR 0.02 will be donated to  
a local charity organisation  – Charity Star . STORE WASTE AND RECYCLINGBeing 100% circular also means 
addressing our own store waste and 
recycling. While much of the waste generated in our stores is sent to 
our warehouses and recycled from 
there, we want to make sure that the remaining waste is handled in the 
best possible way. We are focusing our 
efforts on the most common types of waste-cardboard, plastic and paper.
Much depends on existing recycling 
systems in the country or region 
where our stores are located. While 
these can pose challenges locally, over the last year we further increased the 
share of stores that have recycling 
systems for these types of waste to 71% (2015: 61%, 2014: 58%, 2013: 47%). 
Our aim is to further increase this 
share and ultimately reach 100%.Case study: Beauty recycling 
at & Other Stories
We maintain a sustainable approach across our 
beauty products. For example, customers can 
recycle & Other Stories beauty packaging by 
returning any beauty containers to our stores. The packaging is sorted directly in the store and 
then taken on to the nearest recycling station.
We use standard packaging for the H&M group’s 
beauty products and use of paper to a minimum 
by printing all necessary information on product boxes instead of on a separate folder.2013 2014 2015 2016

The science is clear: climate change is happening, and it’s 
happening because of humans. Most climate experts (as well 
as governments, businesses and NGOs) agree that the release 
of greenhouse gases is causing global temperatures to rise. Unchecked, this change will lead to disastrous outcomes, 
including a dramatic rise in sea levels and an increase in the 
number and severity of extreme weather events.
In December 2015, countries from 
around the world gathered in Paris 
for COP21* and agreed that to avoid 
this threat, we must do whatever  it takes to limit global warming to  
2 degrees Celsius or preferably well 
below that. Most governments have now submitted their climate plans 
but despite unprecedented levels of 
commitment and mobilisation they are not enough. We have to do more 
to keep our climate stable.As a large business with a unique 
scale and reach, we have a responsi -
bility to go beyond simply cutting our emissions. We have to work to meet the needs of the planet. This means 
setting an example in our own opera -
tions, driving change along our value 
chain, and help leading our entire 
industry towards its transformation.

Becoming Climate  
Positive
Climate change is a key challenge for any 
industry, including fashion. To address 
it, we need to change the way products 
are produced and enjoyed. We want to support this transformation by making 
our value chain climate positive – all the 
way from cotton farms to our customers’ washing machines. This means remov -
ing more greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere than our value chain is responsible for – making it climate 
positive.
We have been involved with a num -
ber of expert scientific organisations 
to develop our strategy. With the help of the WWF Climate Savers, we have 
gained insight and expertise empower -
ing us to design our long-term strategy. 
Using a science-based approach, we have 
established short-term milestones that 
address our own operations and value chain. The strategy contains three key 
priorities to achieve a climate positive 
value chain by 2040 at the latest.

for energy across our value chain. This includes the energy need all the way from 
when the raw material is produced to our 
customers when caring for the products.
PRIORITY 2  
100% Renewable Energy
We are committed to maximizing the 
use of renewable and sustainable energy 
throughout our value chain. We want to support the transition into renewable energy for the whole world by using 
renewable energy ourselves and helping 
our suppliers and customers to transition to fossil free energy. 
PRIORITY 3  
Climate Resilience and Carbon Sinks
We aim to strengthen the planet’s natu -
ral systems to support stability in its eco -
systems and climate. We need to identify operative measures to reduce existing 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to ensure we are decreasing the pressure 
on global warming. Our ambition is to 
reduce more greenhouse gases than our value chain is responsible for.
To achieve this, we need to address  
many challenges along the way, such  
as worldwide access to viable renewable 
energy and innovation that enables the efficient uptake of CO
2. This will require 
collaboration. We will only succeed if we 
engage all participants along our value 
chain, from governments and suppliers to our colleagues and customers. Within 
our supply chain, our goal is to achieve a 
climate neutral supply chain for first tier and second tier suppliers by 2030. This 
will require both energy efficiency and  
a transition to renewable energy. 
We are encouraging and empowering our 
suppliers to become more energy efficient and use renewable energy. Ultimately, we 
want to pave the way towards a truly sus -
tainable fashion industry and demonstrate 
that climate positive fashion is possible.1.  Leadership in energy efficiency

Stakeholder interview WWF – Global Partner
Why has the WWF teamed up with the 
H&M group to address climate change? 
Businesses influence the world. The 
WWF seeks to transform businesses into leaders of the low-carbon economy and 
ensure they become part of the solution. 
The H&M group is the second largest fashion retailer in the world, and has great 
potential to address both its own direct 
environmental impacts, and to realise positive change within its value chain and 
the clothing industry. It can lead by exam -
ple within the sector and the business 
community.
How has the WWF supported the H&M 
group in developing its Climate Positive 
Strategy?
The H&M group wanted to develop a long-term climate positive strategy for their value chain. We helped them create a 2040 strategy and the pathways to 
achieve it. We also helped define short -
er-term milestones under the WWF’s 
Climate Savers programme. Together, we 
developed ambitious science-based tar -
gets for the H&M group’s emissions until 
2020. We are committed to developing 
their renewable energy portfolio, engage -
ment activities on climate and energy 
policy, and 2020 milestones on addressing 
impacts with the value chain.
What are the most challenging aspects 
of implementing the Climate Positive 
strategy?
The H&M group has committed to reduce more greenhouse gas emissions than they 
are responsible for by 2040. This is hugely 
ambitious, especially considering the scale and complexity of their value chain. The 
most challenging aspect is therefore also 
within the value chain. For example, how to ensure that the H&M group’s suppliers 
adopt similar ambitions, how to influence 
customer behaviour, how to address impacts related to material needs and 
recycling of garments. These will all take 
capacity building, awareness raising, inno -vative approaches and overall collabora -
tion across the H&M group’s value chain.
How can this partnership create scal -
able change? What importance does 
the H&M group’s strategy have in the 
industry?Leading by example is precisely what the 
WWF expects from its business partners. 
The H&M group has fully met this chal -
lenge through its new climate strategy. 
Because the partnership addresses all the 
relevant climate aspects and focuses on both long- and short-term, the H&M group can lead the way in showing the industry 
what can and should be done to address 
climate impacts. Ambitious action always spurs on the sector.
What is unique about this partnership, 
and where will it be going in the next 
five years?
This is a transformational partnership, and aims to bring long-term sustainable 
change to the H&M group and the fashion 
industry. Because the partnership’s work spans several sustainability areas (water, 
climate and strategic decisions), it enables 
us to take a more holistic approach to address challenges and opportunities. Combining the H&M group’s size with the 
WWF’s global network of sustainability 
experts creates a strong platform for bringing that change on.
Looking ahead, I hope our partnership will 
inspire other brands to address their water 
and climate challenges – both on their own 
and in collaboration with others. I expect the partnership will have influenced the 
fashion sector in other important sus -
tainability areas, such as future business 
models, landscape approaches for raw material sourcing and collaboration with 
other industries and customers to create  
a more sustainable society.

Leadership in energy  
efficiency
Energy efficiency is a critical yet simple 
concept, the optimizing of output from 
the smallest necessary energy input.  
The principle of energy efficiency must be applied across our entire value chain. 
WITHIN THE H&M GROUP
We are committed to using less electric -
ity per square metre of sales area, also referred to as ‘electricity intensity’. So far, we have reduced this by 8.3% against 
a 2007 baseline. Our original goal was 
to achieve a 20% reduction by 2020, but to strengthen our overall ambition to 
become Climate Positive throughout our 
value chain by 2040, we have now raised this to a 25% reduction by 2030 (with 
2016 as a new baseline). This means we 
will reduce a further 25% beyond our current reductions.* 
– To meet this goal, we have allocated 
more resources to improve our ways of 
working, identify strategic opportuni -
ties and take appropriate action. This 
includes continuing to work with store 
rebuilds, and investing in new technolo -ENERGY USE

By 2030, every store we construct will use 40% less energy per square metre 
than the stores we construct today. 
ACROSS OUR VALUE CHAIN 
Using less energy for more output is  
a fundamental part of our strategy and again, something that can be applied 
across our entire value chain. Within 
our supply chain we have committed to achieving a climate neutral supply chain 
for first tier and second tier suppliers 
by 2030. This includes both energy efficiency and transition into renewa -
ble energy. This commitment includes milestones such as:–  20% of factories enrolled in an  energy efficiency programme by 2018.
–  100% of factories enrolled in an energy efficiency programme by 2025.
–  30% GHG reduction per product by 2025 compared to 2017 baseline.
– Through supplier energy efficiency programmes in Bangladesh, China, 
India and Turkey we have reduced green 
house gases emissions. During 2016, our suppliers achieved savings of nearly 30 
million kWh as a result of our improve -
ment programmes. These programmes 
have also supported savings of nearly  
8 millon tonnes of natural gas and 1.5 kilo 
tonnes of coal. Combined, this adds up to over 200 kilo tonnes fewer greenhouse 
gases emitted, which is equivalent to 
almost 30,000 homes’ total electricity use for a year.**  
– We are also working to reduce the 
energy used in our logistics, transport 
and warehouses. For example, we have a 
goal to ensure that 100% of our transport service providers (TSPs) are controlled 
by environmental programmes.  
**Energy related to electricity based cooling consumption is included. CO 2e emissions include carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4),

For land-based transport, we use 
SmartWay in North America and 
our own programme* in Europe. For 
shipping, our TSPs must be are part of the Clean Shipping Project. These 
programmes allow us to measure 
and monitor the performance of our TSPs, and therefore set targets for 
improvement. 
– We can also help our customers 
be more energy efficient in how they 
care for the garments they buy from us. Since 2014, all of our garments 
have the Clever Care label included 
in their washing instructions, which encourages decisions that use less 
energy and water. We also have 
information on our website to help customers care for their clothes in  
a less impactful way. Thanks to customers using our garment collect -
ing initiative, we can also increase 
the share of recycled materials in 
our products which enables energy savings in our material processes. 
However, we know we must do more 
to help our customers use less energy when caring for our products.100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLECase study: 
More IT, less impact.
The H&M group’s IT department is part of our 
operations and it is connected to stores, offices 
and data centres in more than 70 countries 
around the world. Our IT demands grow accord -
ing to our business growth (data storage grows even faster) and historically, the environmental impact of our IT has followed this growth. 
Energy savings within IT such as from cash 
register systems, server centres and PCs, are an 
example of how growth can be decoupled from 
resource use. In the past five years, annual IT-  
related energy use has fallen by more than a third, despite the H&M group’s substantial expansion.

Renewable Energy
Renewable energy is an essential compo -
nent of cutting global carbon emissions. 
WITHIN THE H&M GROUP
Our goal is to source 100% of our total 
energy in our own operations (scope 1 
and 2) from renewable sources. We cur -
rently source 96% of our electricity from 
renewable sources, compared with 78% 
in 2015. This sourcing includes meth -
ods such as purchasing of certificates 
recognised by the GHG Protocol and 
generating our own renewable electricity. We use various certification schemes* to 
purchase renewable energy, depending 
on where and how we buy it. We are also exploring ways to build capacity for new 
sources of renewable energy ourselves
– We have invested in GO2, an innova -
tive project that builds on the system of 
Guarantees of Origin, and bundles the cost of our renewable energy usage with 
a contribution to new renewable energy 
supply. The H&M group’s engagement with GO2 in 2015 and 2016 has helped 
make possible the construction of a 
new wind park in Sweden. The Tågeröd Wind Power Plant is expected to generate 
16,000 to 18,000 MWh per year. – We have installed solar panels on some of our own buildings, including some of 
our distribution warehouses and one of our IT parks. We are continuing to 
explore how we can put additional solar 
panels on more of our buildings. 
– We are working with a partner in the 
US to identify potential Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) opportunities, which 
would allow us to effectively finance 
renewable generation projects.
ACROSS OUR VALUE CHAIN 
We are encouraging and empowering our business partners to use renewable 
energy. Although some partners already 
do, many find access to viable renewa -
ble energy limited particularly in new 
markets. We believe the more renewable 
energy the better, so we are working closely with stakeholders – including 
government bodies – to push for pro -
gress. For example, we have conducted 
workshops with our suppliers and gov -
ernment representatives in Bangladesh and India to push for renewable energy and identify possible ways forward.

Climate resilience and 
carbon sinks
We are committed to fully eliminating 
greenhouse gas emissions from our own 
operations. However, in our value chain 
there will still be unavoidable emissions* despite focusing hard on energy effi -
ciency and renewable energy. This is why we will also engage in climate resilience activities to absorb both the emissions 
that we are responsible for acrosss our 
value chain and beyond to become  Climate Positive.
Our approach is to support mechanisms 
that reduce existing emissions while 
strengthening climate resilience.** This 
is an area that we need to further develop and push forward in collaboration with 
experts. Currently, we are exploring 
opportunities in three areas:
1. Natural carbon sinks – nature’s exist -
ing mechanisms to absorb greenhouse 
gases. This could include programmes 
that protect valuable biomass such as 
rainforests or investments in more sus -
tainable agriculture.2. Technological carbon sinks – tech -
nological innovations to absorb exist -
ing greenhouse gases with the aim of 
turning them into new products and 
materials. 
3. Reductions outside of our value chain 
– engagement activities that reduce greenhouse gases coming from sources 
unrelated to our value chain
Becoming Climate Positive
We urge innovators and experts in these 
fields to collaborate with us and like -
minded partners to further develop these opportunities and strengthen climate resilience. Resilience within planetary 
boundaries is crucial for many reasons, 
including the need to address global warming and its consequences, and to 
safeguard global social security. This is

* Unavoidable emissions are the remaining greenhouse gas emissions we create, even after a focused increase in energy efficiency and transition to renewable energy. These can include emissions from fossil-based household electricity when customers wash their 
clothes. ** Resilience is the planet’s natural long-term system to handle tension in order to keep the climate and ecosystems stable. For an ecosystem, such as a forest it can be the capacity to endure storms, fires or pollution. For a farmer, resilience can be tolerat -
ing pest outbreaks or climate change. Resilience is the system capacity to withstand stress and changes as well as the ability to develop essential functionality. In the long term, this means the ability to adapt. More knowledge about for example, how biodiversity and innovation can strengthen climate resilience is increasingly important to mitigate tension and manage the changes already taking place due to climate change.100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLEIncrease GHG uptakeDecrease emissionsOVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / OUR AMBITIONS / 100% CIRCULAR / 100% RENEWABLE  / OUR CLIMATE IMPACT / KEY COLLABORATIONSTHE H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 63 OF 124HOW WE REPORT ABOUT THE H&M GROUP STANDARDS & POLICIES VISION & STRATEGY 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% FAIR & EQUAL100% Circular & Renewable
According to the Greenhouse Gas Pro -
tocol, emissions can be categorised into 
three groups: scopes 1, 2 and 3. Scope 
1 covers ‘direct’ emissions, which are defined as emissions that we – the H&M 
group – either own or have direct control 
over. Scope 2 covers ‘indirect’ emissions, from the consumption of purchased elec -
tricity. Purchased electricity is defined as electricity that is bought or otherwise brought into the organisational bound -
ary of the company. By looking at our value chain, we can see that our own operations as a business represent a 
small proportion of our total emissions. 
We can address our scope 1 and 2 emis -
sions through energy efficiency measures and investments in renewable energy.
A typical scope 3 emission comes from 
anything outside of our operations that we have indirect control over. This includes our suppliers and the producers 
of raw materials used in our products, 
as well as emissions from the use of our products, for example when our custom -
ers use washing machines. 
As with many companies, the majority 
of the H&M group’s greenhouse gas emis -sions are scope 3, which means they lie 
outside of our own operations. To tackle 
this, we have carried out a thorough 
materiality analysis to identify the emis -
sion ‘hot spots’ along our value chain. 
Considering the complexity of our value 
chain, this type of analysis requires some assumptions for example, how 
many times an average T-shirt is washed 
in different regions of the world. To this end, we are working intensively to build 
systems that improve the collection and 
accuracy of sustainability data from  our suppliers.
The main sources of greenhouse gas 
emissions in our value chain are fabric 
production, product manufacturing 
and use of sold products (that is, prod -
ucts that are used and cared for). This 
insight enables us to work strategically 
to decrease scope 3 emissions and report on our progress.* We intent to share 
what we have learned because we want 
our work to help drive change across the industry.
* Climate impacts are based on a scope 3 assessment done by Ecofys in 2016, based on 2014 data. The categories are based on GHG Protocol. Calculations in the footprint analysis are based on calculations on a combination of good quality H&M group 
(2014 material usage) data combined with best available public data sources on CO2 emissions, using conservative assumptions. We are working to further improve the calculations by using primary data from our main suppliers.100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE

Introduction
At the H&M group, we act on our 
100% Fair & Equal ambition in two 
focus areas: fair jobs for all and being 
stewards for diversity and inclusiveness. 
Fair jobs are important because employment is one 
of the best ways for people to grow as individuals 
and professionals. In addition, providing stable 
employment with fair compensation helps lift people out of poverty. The need for good, fair jobs is 
already significant and growing fast. It is estimated 
that globally, we will need over 600 million new jobs by 2030.** 
Our stewardship of diversity and inclusiveness 
is also a critical part of our 100% Fair & Equal 
ambition. For example, when women and girls 
enjoy the same access to opportunities as men and boys, communities flourish and the economy 
grows. According to a recent McKinsey report,*** 
a ‘full-potential’ scenario in which women partici -
pate in the economy identically to men would add 
up to $28 trillion (26%) to the annual global GDP by 
2025 compared with a business-as-usual scenario. This impact is roughly equivalent to the size of the 
combined US and Chinese economies today.100% FAIR & EQUAL

Fair jobs are inextricably linked to 
human rights, from the fundamental 
right to the food, health and housing that 
an income should provide to the right to freedom of association and collective 
bargaining.
Human rights also recognise the fun -
damentals: everyone’s equal value and 
equal entitlement to full enjoyment of their rights. Advancing diversity and 
inclusiveness is therefore important to 
actively strive for and promote through business. The UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights sets the 
global standard of what businesses must do to embed respect for human rights throughout their operations and busi -
ness relationships.
Our focus on 100% Fair & Equal means 
ensuring that our values and respect for 
human rights are upheld and promoted 
within our own company and across 
our supply chain as well as fair and 
equal treatment for everyone connected to our business. We want to use our 
influence to advance respect for human 
rights, be a force for positive change in the communities we touch and have a 
positive impact on people’s lives across 
our industry. In return, this will make our business more resilient, productive and relevant to our stakeholders and as 
a result build loyalty with employees, 
customers and business partners.Human rights Our ambitions
At the macro level, the H&M group has two broad commitments: to offer fair 
jobs and to be stewards for diversity and 
inclusiveness. We understand that the regions we operate in will have different 
challenges, so we must take local context 
into account as we develop our strategy and roadmaps. 
We will continue our efforts to ensure 
fair jobs for our colleagues, the people 
employed by our business partners and 
the people employed throughout our value chain. This means employment 
where every employee is treated with 
respect and where everyone’s equal value is recognised. No matter if it’s about our 
colleagues at H&M group or employees 
at the suppliers making our products. It also means fair compensation, a safe 
and healthy workplace, an environment 
free from discrimination and respect for every employee’s voice, including the 
right to freedom of association and col -
lective bargaining.
 
The H&M group is also continuing to 
make diversity and inclusiveness a natu -
ral part of our business. Being a steward 
means actively preventing discrimina -
tion in the workplace, influencing the communities we touch – including our 
customers – by promoting our values 
and sponsoring inclusion. It is about 
recognizing, respecting and embracing people’s differences and advancing their 
ability to contribute and develop. We 
work actively to achieve a diverse work -
force where all employees enjoy equal 
opportunities for professional develop -
ment. We also work to promote diverse 
and inclusive ideals through how and 
what we communicate with our custom -
ers and other stakeholders in our society.“  A company’s single greatest oppor -
tunity to contribute to the ‘people 
part’ of sustainable development lies in advancing respect for the human rights of workers and communities affected by their business.

The H&M group is one of the biggest 
fashion companies in the world. We 
want everyone who works for us to know 
that their career is full of potential. We support and encourage a love of fashion, 
design and business amongst employees, 
and welcome ideas and feedback. With our many unique brands all over the 
world, we always strive to be a fair and 
equal employer. 
Our diversity makes us strong. It creates 
an inclusive and welcoming workplace in which everyone’s individuality is highly 
valued. We believe that when a diverse 
mix of people come together and share their knowledge, experience and ideas, 
it inspires and attracts talented people 
from all over the world. 
Culture is important to the H&M group. 
We believe that you can have fun while achieving great results. Our shared 
values bring us together and guide us in 
our daily work; they are a part of who we are, what we stand for, and how we act. 
They help create an open, dynamic and 
down-to-earth company culture where anything is possible. Every H&M group 
employee is part of leading the change 
towards a sustainable future of fashion and design.In our Global Employee Strategy, we strive to create a workplace that attracts 
the talent that we need for our continued 
success. That is a place with endless pos -
sibilities to grow and where employees 
make a conscious choice to stay. A place 
that is transparent and trustworthy, fair and equal. A place where our company 
values are the red thread in everything 
we do.
OUR COMMITMENT TO CREATING FAIR 
JOBS IS BUILT ON FOUR FOUNDATIONS1. We make sure we have the right people 
on board and in the right positions. We 
do this through how we attract, recruit and induct employees.
2. We offer all of employees the opportu -
nity to grow and develop in their roles, 
and we emphasise leadership training 
towards this. We enable development through business growth, internal 
recruitment and training opportunities.
3. We promote a values-driven way of 
working and expect all employees to be 
ambassadors for these values in their work. Our shared values (outlined in ‘the 
H&M way’*) are the starting point for how 
we do business and how we interact with the world around us. Our strong company culture gives us a competitive advantage and ensures a sustainable way of working. 
4. We provide a solid foundation of fair 
and attractive working conditions. These Fair jobs for all: Within the H&M group100% FAIR & EQUALOVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL: WITHIN THE H&M GROUP / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL: WITHIN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN / STEWARDS FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS / KEY COLLABORATIONS

POLICY DEVELOPMENT
– In 2016, we implemented the H&M 
group Global Compensation and Benefit 
Policy, which aims to secure equal pay for equal work based on local context and 
fair wage practices. We communicated 
the new policy to employees in all markets. Function Managers and HR Managers 
will use the policy to identify gaps to 
becoming compliant and create an action plan, time frame and follow-ups. 
– We developed a Global Health & Safety 
Policy during 2016 that was launched 
in January 2017. The new policy is an 
upgrade to our existing Safety Policy and 
will help establish a strong health and 
safety culture across our operations. In 2016, we completed another successful 
Global Safety Week and received strong 
engagement from employees via a ‘safety selfie’ activity. This group-wide initiative 
helps to contribute to our safety culture. Global Safety Week will become Global 
Health & Safety Week in 2017 in line with 
the global HR department’s launch of the 
new Group Health & Safety Policy. 
– To clarify our position on Labour Rela -
tions, we developed a new Global Labour 
Relations Policy that was launched in 
early 2017. This clarifies our commitment 
towards neutrality, freedom of association and collective bargaining, and educates 
employees on how to have a workplace 
dialogue with local partners.
TRAINING
– We gathered 150 examples of ‘good 
practice’ health and safety initiatives 
from across our company around the world. These examples make up the 
foundations of our new Health & Safety 
Environment Good Practice Bank, which we will launch in 2017 and maintain 
going forward. The Good Practice Bank 100% FAIR & EQUALOVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL: WITHIN THE H&M GROUP / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL: WITHIN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN / STEWARDS FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS / KEY COLLABORATIONS
exists for local managers to search 
through and learn from. 
WORKPLACE DIALOGUE AND LABOUR 
RELATIONS
– We actively participate in numer -
ous global and local forums to discuss 
specific issues related to the H&M group 
with our social partners and employee 
representatives. These opportunities provide a way for all employees to con -
tribute to the development of the work -
place to achieve a fair, open and inclusive work environment. Our global meetings 
include our well-established European 
Works Council (representatives from 12 different countries who are H&M 
employees). In addition, we have ongoing 
dialogue with UNI Global Union on an annual basis. “  We want everyone who works for 
us to know that their career is full of potential. 
”
“  Our shared values bring us together and guide us in our daily work:  
they are a part of who we are, what we stand for, and how we act.

Fair jobs for all: Within our supply chain
Our responsibility extends to all of the 
people who contribute to the success of 
the H&M group. This includes the work -
ers at our suppliers’ factories, who play 
such an important role in our company.
We want everyone who works within the 
fashion supply chain to have fair and 
decent jobs. That means a workplace that 
respects workers’ voices and their right to freedom of association and collective bar -
gaining, is safe and healthy, provides a fair living wage, offers career opportunities through the recognition of skill and expe -
rience and that treats workers with respect while recognising their equal value. 
Creating fair jobs leads to countless 
positive impacts along our supply chain. Fair jobs are a material issue for us and 
are part of our commitment to creating 
a sustainable fashion industry. Fair jobs are also the best way for us to make sure the markets we source from remain stable and productive, even in the face of 
other global challenges such as climate 
change and economic uncertainty. What’s more, fair jobs reflect people’s human 
rights and enable their advancement in 
line with the UN’s Sustainable Develop -
ment Goals. See more in How We Report 
on p. 117.
Obviously, how we partner and manage 
our suppliers is fundamental to achieving 
change in this area. For example, through our assessment approach (using our 
Supplier Impact Partnership Programme), 
we enable, promote and reward good performance from our suppliers – beyond 
the minimum requirements of stand -
ard audits. We measure performance on 
issues such as health and safety, overtime, 
wages, use of energy, water and chemicals. 
Improving these issues creates a collective impact, which will eventually lead to last -ing, systemic change within the factories and the communities around them.
We know from experience that creating 
systemic change around these issues is 
not easy – a complex problem rarely has 
a simple solution. Discrete or isolated programmes do not work; instead, we 
must work towards a similarly holistic 
collection of solutions and collaborate with others to tackle the challenges in 
our industry. In December 2016, H&M 
hosted a conference on these issues in Myanmar, with over 100 industry pro -
fessionals in attendance. The Fair and Equal conference saw discussion on how to provide fair jobs, protect human rights 
and strengthen freedom of association 
along the value chain.
Our industrial relations and wage pro -
grammes involve innovative collabora -
tions between the International Labour 
Organisation (ILO), the Swedish Inter -
national Development Agency (Sida), the 
Swedish trade union IF Metall, and the 
IndustriALL Global Union and within 
ACT where we collaborate with other brands and IndustriALL. GOALSAll of our actions for 100% Fair & Equal 
are connected to our ambitions and 
global group goals. The goals included in this chapter apply to the H&M group on 
a global level. As explained in our Vision 
& Strategy chapter (see p. 17), goal setting is an ongoing process that continuously 
adapts to our progress and external 
factors. 
Our goals for 100% Fair & Equal are: 
– To ensure democratically-elected 
worker representation at business 
partners producing 50% of H&M group’s product volume by 2018.
– To ensure improved wage management 
systems supporting fair living wages 
at business partners producing 50% of 
H&M group’s product volume by 2018.* 
– To reach 100% remediation and enrol 
new factories in the Bangladesh Accord Inspection Programme by 2018. 
– To have 90% of our suppliers regard  
the H&M group as a fair business partner 
by 2018.100% FAIR & EQUAL
* We have decided to measure and report on our goal by ‘percentage of product volume’ instead of ‘number of strategic business partners. This gives a better and more relevant picture on how we measure progress towards our long-term ambitions of well-functioning 
industrial relations throughout our supply chain, and for every worker to earn a fair living wage. During the ongoing implementation, we have decided to redirect our focus for the 2018 milestones to countries and suppliers based on local needs, business priori -
ties and where we can scale up fast and effectively while still maintaining the initial scope of impact.“  We want everyone who works 
within the fashion supply chain to have fair and decent jobs.

Our Industrial Relations  
Strategy
  Our aim is to contribute to 
well-functioning industrial relations 
in our sourcing markets.  We believe that well-functioning indus -
trial relations and collective bargaining 
are the ultimate keys to achieving our 
fair jobs ambitions. However, many of these markets lack sufficient systems 
to, for example, enable employers and 
worker representatives to negotiate their wages collectively – the legislation may 
not exist, or a supplier may use inade -
quate structures for workplace dialogue. 
Our aim is therefore to contribute to 
well-functioning industrial relations 
and workplace dialogue in our sourcing markets.
In countries where unionisation is 
restricted by law or where systems are 
insufficient, we work, for example, to 
empower workers by raising their aware -
ness about their rights at work, to train 
our suppliers and to support the estab -lishment of democratic employee rep -
resentation. In time, these should create the foundations for effective collective 
bargaining systems. 
We are working on several different 
levels to achieve our goals, most signifi -
cantly with our supplier factories, as well 
as on the industry and government lev -
els. And, as shown in the Industrial Rela -
tions Framework diagram, we must have certain foundations in place to achieve 
well-functioning industrial relations.  We have been working on these issues  
for two decades and have made consider -
able headway, but there is still important 
work to do.

Our Fair Living Wage Strategy
The H&M group wants suppliers to offer 
their employees good working condi -
tions, including fair living wages. To us, this is indisputable and has led us to develop a global Fair Living Wage Strat -
egy.* We want to help ensure fair living wages across the industry and in all of our sourcing markets, but the challenges 
along the way are complex. For exam -
ple, many markets lack adequate wage 
setting processes on a national level. We 
believe that well-functioning industrial 
relations, including collective bargain -
ing, are key to achieve fair living wages 
and improved working conditions.
Achieving systemic change requires 
a huge amount of collaboration between 
stakeholders such as governments, suppliers, brands and trade unions. 
For solutions to work, they must con -
nect relevant stakeholders at the right 
time and in the right way – as shown in 
Fair Living Wage Strategy diagram. For 
example, because we share suppliers with many other retailers (and factory 
workers receive the same wage no matter 
which brand they are making products for), we must build partnerships with other brands to drive sustainable change across the industry. 
We also engage with governments and 
other partners to promote the required 
legal framework for enabling negotia -
tions between employers and worker 
representatives. This involves regularly 
advocating stronger wage legislation in 
priority countries and meeting with min -
isters every year. 
Another part of the puzzle is facilitat -
ing the democratic election of effective 
employee representation at factories 
through trade unions or worker com -
mittees (dependent on local context 
and choice of employees). Democrati -
cally-elected worker representatives are 
an essential component of functioning 
industrial relations, which also forms 
the base for fairly negotiated wages. By incentivising and enabling factories to 
create these systems, we can contribute 
to the building blocks for peaceful con -
flict resolution and collective bargaining. 
It is also important for factories to 
implement improved wage management 
systems. The H&M group is currently 
using the Fair Wage method , which aims that our own purchasing practices sup -
port our suppliers in implementing fair 
living wages. Our practices should make 
it possible to fulfil our business idea and give long-term benefits to workers, sup -
pliers, customers and the environment.to create management systems in which 
workers know what wages they are enti -
tled to (including overtime compensation 
and benefits), as well as ensuring they are 
paid according to their skills, experience 
and performance. We also need to ensure

Industrial relations, workplace  
dialogue and wage management  
programmes
This map summarises some of our most impactful 
actions for our industrial relations, workplace dia -
logue and wage management programme ambitions. 
In 2016, we continued to scale up our industrial rela -
tions and workplace dialogue programmes, reaching 
290 factories compared with 132 in 2015. We also introduced a programme in Ethiopia for six factories, 
covering 4,000 workers. In 2017, we plan to expand 
this to cover Indonesia, Turkey and Myanmar.
In 2016, we scaled up the implementation of the 
Fair Wage method reaching a total of 140 compared with 68 last year. We introduced and implemented 
the Fair Wage method to three new markets: Indo -
nesia, India and Turkey. In 2017, we plan to include 
Myanmar.
The scale up of these programmes represents 
important milestones towards our overall goal that 
by 2018, business partners representing 50% of 
the H&M group’s production volume should have improved wage management systems and demo -
cratically-elected worker representation.
* This KPI currently shows factories that received the H&M group’s work-place 
dialogue training. When the system support for the SIPP is fully implemented, we will be able to show data on share of product volume with democraticaly-elected worker representation from our complete factory base.100% FAIR & EQUAL

In China, freedom of association is 
restricted by law, which is why we are 
focusing our efforts in China on well-functioning 
worker participatory committees.
Could you tell us a bit about yourself?
My name is Mi Qiaoyun. I’m 34 years old and I have worked in the linking depart -
ment for nine years. For the last four years, I have also been a worker representative. 
What does your role as a worker  
representative involve?  
There are seven other elected worker 
representatives at my factory. Our job is 
to open up dialogue between employees and managers. To do that, I talk to my 
colleagues about any problems they have, 
and take any I can’t solve to our quarterly meetings with the factory management 
team. Together, we try to find solutions  
that work for everyone, and we follow up  to make sure everyone is happy.How do you enjoy being a worker  
representative?  
Being a worker representative makes me 
happy and proud. It feels good to have 
been elected twice by my colleagues, 
and I have lots of training opportunities to develop my communication skills and learn 
from external service providers. I want to 
do my job as well as possible, and I want to make sure the dialogue between managers 
and workers leads to a better factory.
What successes have you and your  
fellow representatives had? 
Most of the problems shared by our 
colleagues are about salary levels, the salary system and welfare issues – like the 
food in the canteen. Through our worker 
representative process, we have started to improve the canteen food. There are now 
more dishes to choose from and they taste 
better. We have also agreed on a future balanced wage structure to make sure 
everyone starts receiving a fair wage.Name  Mi Qiaoyun
Title  Worker representative in China 
at Suzhou Wanli Knitting Factory.Interview with Mi Qiaoyun, a worker representativeIMPROVING INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
In 2016, we renewed the Global Frame -
work Agreement (GFA) with IndustriALL and IF Metall. The GFA is founded on the belief that collaboration and a well-func -
tioning dialogue between the parties on the labour market is necessary for lasting improvements to workers’ lives, for stable 
production markets and ultimately, for 
a mature textile industry. The goal is industrial relations that respect freedom 
of association, give worker representa -
tives a voice and enable trade unions to 
negotiate collectively.
So far, our collaboration within the GFA 
has been positive. It has led to setting 
up and training national monitoring 
committees in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Turkey. These 
national monitoring committees consist 
of representatives from IndustriALL’s affiliated trade unions and the H&M 
group and are responsible for the on-the-
ground implementation of the GFA. That means they support suppliers and local 
trade unions to negotiate and solve con -
flicts peacefully and in good faith on the 
factory level. The committees therefore 
contribute to well-functioning workplace 
dialogue and industrial relations in the countries where we source our products.*IMPROVING PURCHASING PRACTICES
In 2016, we had the internal launch of 
our updated strategy on purchasing practices. This helps ensure we consist -
ently engage with our business partners in a fair and transparent way. We recog -
nise that our buying practices affect the 
ability of our suppliers to provide decent 
pay and conditions for their workers. This is why we constantly look for ways 
to improve purchasing practices and pri -
oritise our actions according to feedback 
from suppliers and other stakeholders. 
Highlights of our work include:
– We are working to make our measure -
ment of capacity as accurate as possible. 
This helps improve planning and order placement processes and helps our suppli -
ers use their capacity better. By ensuring capacity is not overbooked, we reduce the risk of excessive overtime and strengthen 
our long-term partnerships and commit -
ments with specific suppliers.
 
We want to create the right incentives  
by promoting competition based on pro -
ductivity, product quality, delivery time 
and other value-adding factors rather 
than on wages. To do this, we are work -
ing to get a fuller picture of the costing 100% FAIR & EQUALOVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL: WITHIN THE H&M GROUP / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL: WITHIN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN / STEWARDS FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS / KEY COLLABORATIONS

breakdown of each product and increase 
the transparency of this between ourselves 
and suppliers. Wage cost is one key part in 
our costing method, and by refining the method and isolating the wage component 
further, together with improved capacity 
measures, we can better account for wage increases and reflect that in the negotia -
tions process in a fair and transparent way. 
ENGAGING WITH ACT
We continue to engage in ACT (Action 
Collaboration Transformation), an ini -
tiative that brings international brands, 
retailers and IndustriALL Global Union 
together to address the issue of a living wages. ACT supports collective bargain -
ing as one way to improve wages in the industry alongside purchasing practices and manufacturing standards. 
During 2016, the initiative established 
the ACT Foundation and appointed an 
executive director. This will further 
strengthen the initiative as it continues to support and facilitate the consultative 
process towards industry bargaining in 
targeted countries.
ADDRESSING SOCIAL SECURITY
The H&M group continued to address issues regarding social security, which 
include the risk to workers’ rights through the use of short-term contracts 
or the failure to issue a working permit. 
For example, we are currently tackling the 
misuse of limited fixed-duration con -
tracts in Cambodia. When workers are on open-ended undetermined-duration contracts (UDCs), it improves their access 
to social security and decreases the bar -
riers for workers to exercise the right to 
organise and form unions. We wanted to 
adopt a constructive approach that could 
bring about sustainable change on this issue, and in 2016, we engaged Solidarity 
Centre, a labour rights organisation, to 
develop a training plan. Through this, suppliers and trade unions will be trained 
in Cambodian labour law and the advan -
tages of UDCs. 
We also took action on social security 
issues in Turkey. Together with other members of the Ethical Trading Initiative 
(ETI), we lobbied for improved work per -
mit processes in this country, which were 
adopted in January 2016 and ensure ref -
ugees are entitled to the same conditions and social security as Turkish workers.
ADDRESSING FORCED LABOUR
Forced labour is identified as a salient human rights issue that continues to 
constitute an actual and potential risk throughout our value chain. We have 
several risk assessment processes to 
ensure we continuously identify where 
these risks may occur and whether they have been adequately addressed.
Apart from the initiatives already 
running, we took additional steps to 
address forced labour in the value 
chain in 2016, see more on p. 114. This included engaging in the Amsterdam 
Coalition, an initiative between major 
global brands and retailers that is sup -
ported by the OECD. The coalition aims 
to help prevent and mitigate harmful 
impacts on workers in the spinning mill industry in South India, particularly in 
Tamil Nadu. Comprehensive informa -
tion about the steps taken to address 
forced labour in our value chain can be 
found in our Modern Slavery Statement .
We also arranged internal training on modern slavery and forced labour. This 
was provided to about 25 employees from various business functions and to 
global and local sustainability staff. The 
training was organised in collaboration with the ETI.
ADDRESSING CHILD LABOUR
Child labour is a salient human rights 
issue. Today, it is rare to find any work -ers below the statutory minimum age in 
our suppliers’ factories. We have taken 
a clear stance against all use of child 
labour for many years. It is a minimum requirement for all factories producing 
for the H&M group, and we continuously 
monitor compliance. 
In 2016, we updated our risk assessment 
for new and existing raw materials to further integrate the human rights risk 
perspective, including the risk of child 
labour. The risk of child labour in our value chain is known to be connected to 
raw materials. 
We also continued to make sure our 
Child Labor Policy was implemented, 
and engaged in initiatives that strength -
ened children’s rights. See Modern 
Slavery Statement  for more details. If we 
discover any person below the mini -
mum age working in any of our business partner’s factories, we have a clear policy 
in place that guides us to act in the best interests of the child. This can include 
ensuring the individual enrols in school, 
compensation to the family for the lost income and partnering with civil society 
organisations. For more information on 
our policies here .100% FAIR & EQUALOVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL: WITHIN THE H&M GROUP / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL: WITHIN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN / STEWARDS FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS / KEY COLLABORATIONSTHE H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 81 OF 124HOW WE REPORT ABOUT THE H&M GROUP STANDARDS & POLICIES VISION & STRATEGY 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE100% Fair & Equal
We conducted an assessment on mica 
– an ingredient most commonly found 
in cosmetic products – to support our 
ongoing strategy development on the risks of child labour associated with its 
production in India. 
We also entered a collaboration with 
the Centre for Child Rights and Corpo -
rate Social Responsibility (CCR CSR) 
in a project to prevent child labour and 
protect young workers in our supplier 
factories in Myanmar. The programme provides training in child labour aware -
ness, prevention and remediation in the workplace, as well as effective child protection at work and in the commu -
nity. The training is for both managers and workers, and has so far reached 309 management staff and 660 workers. The 
CCR CSR also produced a baseline report 
and a final report from this project.
ADVANCING THE BANGLADESH 
ACCORDWe were amongst the first companies to 
sign the Bangladesh Accord with the aim 
to help improve fire and building safety in the textile industry in Bangladesh. 
We are actively engaged with the Accord 
team, and have been on the steering committee since day one. We are also 
closely engaged with all of our suppliers to support them and follow up on their 
progress. During 2016, we made remedi -
ation progress data publicly available on our website. For more information, see: about.hm.com . We arranged a supplier 
summit in the spring 2016 to which all Bangladeshi suppliers were invited to dis -
cuss the Accord and share best practices. 
> bangladeshaccord.orgCase study: Proactively protecting land rights
Land is a source of livelihood for many people; it is central to economic rights 
and often tied to social and cultural 
rights. Land is therefore an issue that impacts directly on many human rights. 
Disputes over land can be a cause of 
conflict and dispute. Forcibly evicting or 
displacing people from their land without 
free, prior and informed consent to allow for large-scale development or business 
constitutes land grabbing. This carries 
the risk of severe violations of human rights. In certain countries where land 
grabbing occurs, there is a risk (albeit 
a small one) that our value chain could be connected to this issue. A lack of 
material traceability and ownership from 
suppliers can make it difficult to identify and address this problem. 
We always conduct an initial risk assess -
ment for a country we’re considering 
entering. In recent years, we have identi -
fied land rights and land grabbing issues 
in Myanmar and Ethiopia. Because we 
decided to enter both of these markets, 
we introduced measures to ensure that our suppliers were (and remain) uncon-nected to land issues. We apply these measures for any new suppliers. In Ethi -
opia, we ran additional studies to help us get a clear picture of our value chain in this country and inform our strategy 
going forward. 
Land rights and land grabbing are often 
related to raw material production. In col -
laboration with the Dutch government, 
we are currently exploring the possibility 
to use locally-sourced raw materials in 
our supply chain in Ethiopia. To this end, we have set up a collaboration with Soli -
daridad, an international network devel -
opment organisation, and the Ethiopian Cotton Producers Ginners and Exporters 
Association to research and develop  
a report detailing the key sustainability 
issues in Ethiopia’s cotton sector. 
The report provides practical guidance 
for the H&M group and the Dutch and 
Ethiopian governments, and will form  
the basis of our sustainable strategy  
in Ethiopia.100% FAIR & EQUALOVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL: WITHIN THE H&M GROUP / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL: WITHIN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN / STEWARDS FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS / KEY COLLABORATIONSTHE H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 82 OF 124HOW WE REPORT ABOUT THE H&M GROUP STANDARDS & POLICIES VISION & STRATEGY 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE100% Fair & Equal

2014 2015 2016We believe in the equal value of 
every individual. As an employer 
we represent, and as an influencer 
we connect with, a hugely diverse collection of people. We want to 
challenge prejudice wherever we find  
it and wherever possible, help move  our global culture away from restrictive 
stereotypes and harmful norms. It 
is part of who we are. And to us it is simply the right thing to do.
Our most direct area of influence is as a business 
that creates jobs. Jobs are the foundation for indi -
viduals to create livelihoods, for communities to develop and for economies to grow. However,  
prejudice and discrimination can prevent people 
from accessing the labour market. As a global 
employer with a significant platform, we can promote and work for inclusion by demonstrating 
everybody’s equal value. Our vision is that the  
jobs created through our business activities are 
accessible to all, and reflect the diverse mix of  
people in the world around us.
This position is particularly relevant when it comes 
to gender. Of the 75 million people employed by the 
garment industry, the majority are female. Through our suppliers, our business contrib -
utes to job opportunities for around 1.6 million people, of whom about 
65% are female. For many women 
around the world, a job within the garment industry is an important first 
step to accessing formal employment 
that provides improved job security, skills and financial independence. 
Unfortunately, there is still a lot of 
work to do to make sure that men 
and women are treated equally in the 
workplace and have equal access to opportunities. Our guiding principle 
is ‘equal pay for work of equal value’ 
(across all inequality issues, not just gender), for both our internal opera -
tions and at our suppliers. We work actively to detect cases of wage dis -
crimination and duly ensure they are 
corrected, including the gender dimen -
sion in the Wage Management System 
implemented in our supply chain.
Part of the challenge involves 
empowering women to express and 
defend their interests with the view 
to reducing gender inequality in the workplace. One way we are working 
to overcome this is through our col -
laboration with Sida and the ILO, and 
our support of democratically-elected % OF EMPLOYEES AGREEING WITH

Case study: Increasing opportunities for women in India
The H&M group wants all of its employees 
to have the same opportunities to grow and 
develop. Amongst other things, this means 
offering equal working conditions. However, in certain countries where we operate, 
women do not have the same access to 
the labour market as men. In India, the retail sector has lower participation from women. 
H&M is therefore working to increase women’s 
opportunities to take part in working life and build a career.
The local legislation for working hours for 
women in most Indian cities means they can only work after a certain time in the morning 
or before a certain time in the evening. By 
offering safe transport to and from work at these times and proactively working 
together with local legislative authorities, 
H&M has been granted exemptions from these rules.
“The benefits that H&M offers mean that we 
women can work freely and choose working 
hours without having to be afraid,” says  
Niki Pandey, department manager at the 
H&M store in Connaught Place, New Delhi.
H&M also has an indirect influence on 
women’s career opportunities by enabling greater work-life balance. We offer paid parental leave to new fathers in the initial period after a child is born, in addition to 
statutory maternity leave, as well as sickness 
insurance in connection with pregnancy and childbirth. At the recruitment stage, we have 
targeted initiatives to encourage as many 
women as possible to apply.
The initiative in India is an example of how 
the H&M group’s social policies are put into practice. These include the Global Policy on Diversity, Inclusiveness and Equality  
and the Global Non-Discrimination and Non-Harassment Policy. They encompass all 
of the group’s employees and aim to ensure 
a workplace where respect for human rights has the highest priority and there is zero 
tolerance of any kind of discrimination. The 
H&M group’s social policies are based on UN and ILO conventions, amongst other things, 
and have their origins in the H&M group’s 
shared values. See more in the Standards & Policies chapter on p. 107.  
worker representatives. It seems to us that gender-related issues are more 
likely to be raised by women. Given 
the share of women in the garment supply chain and that 38% of the 
elected worker representatives are 
women, we believe that a system of elected worker representatives will 
mean more women start represent -
ing women. In turn, this will lead to 
gender-related issues being addressed 
or recognised in workplace dialogue 
in the workplace.
Of course, inequality is not just about 
gender – discrimination comes in many shapes and sizes. Every person 
who connects with our brands should 
feel represented and welcome. We are a global business that values diversity 
and we want this to be clear to every -
one who connects with us. Establish -
ing this reputation is grounded in how we run our business, but extends 
far beyond. As a large global business, we can take a stand for these values 
in the way we choose to advertise our 
products and promote our brands. 
Our vision is to positively influence 
people and communities by pro -
moting everyone’s right to be, and 
express, who they are.100% FAIR & EQUALOVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL: WITHIN THE H&M GROUP / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL: WITHIN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN / STEWARDS FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS  / KEY COLLABORATIONS

Within the H&M group In our supply chain
– During 2016, we updated our Global 
Non-Discrimination and Non-Harassment 
Policy and our Global Policy on Diversity, 
Inclusiveness and Equality. Our main focus was to implement the updated pol -
icies and increase awareness and shared understanding around expectations.
– We have taken steps to make sure we 
provide equal access to opportunities for men and women working in retail in 
India. In particular, this includes pro -
viding safe transportation home in the 
evenings so that women can legally work 
late, which in turn opens up develop -
ment opportunities. See more in our case 
study on p. 83.
– To prevent the exploitation of refugees 
by suppliers and service providers, we are 
actively monitoring the situation in all 
risk markets. As a company that provides jobs, we can also help the situation by 
providing opportunities for vulnerable 
groups to access the labour market. In response to the ongoing refugee crisis in 
Europe and to promote integration, we 
decided to offer internships for refugees in specific markets. We have initiated a 
collaboration with Save the Children to 
develop training to ensure our mentors – In 2016, we replaced our Code of Conduct with our Sustainability Com -
mitment. This included a revision of our requirements for business partners. One of the new requirements is that all sup -
pliers must have a policy for recruitment that prevents discrimination, harass -
ment and abuse in the workplace. We 
constantly monitor and measure the per -
formance of how factories monitor and 
manage these policies. See more in the 
Standards & Policies chapter on p. 99.
– Through a long-term collaboration 
with the ILO and Sida, we support train -
ing and skills development opportunities 
through the Centre of Excellence for the 
Apparel Industry in Bangladesh. The 
project is showing promising results with a more structured certification of skills, 
a growing availability of Enterprise Based 
Training (EBT) and – in 2015 and 2016 – a total of 4,083 workers who received 
skills certification. This recognition  
of competencies opens the door to better positions and higher salaries; as well  
as better productivity at workplace.  
It also helps workers, especially women,

Our vision for a sustainable fashion industry guides everything we 
do. This vision is underpinned by our sustainability strategy, which 
defines the steps we need to take as an organisation to achieve our 
goals. Our sustainability standards and policies are an essential component because they communicate our operational framework 
and make sure we work in a sustainable way.
Our sustainability standards and poli -
cies help us avoid, mitigate or remediate 
negative impacts and enhance positive 
impact. This is particularly important in countries where laws and regulations 
fall short of our own standards and 
requirements. Whenever relevant and available, we refer and comply to inter -
national standards and widely-recognised initiatives related to the topic, such as ILO Conventions or the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human 
Rights. 
When we do business ‘ the H&M way ’  
we do so ethically, honestly and respon -
sibly, and we continually encourage our 
suppliers and other business partners  
to do the same.
Another important part of our manage -
ment is the SIPP (our Supplier Impact 
Partnership Programme), which we use Occasionally, we work with partners to 
develop external standards, such as our 
collaboration with the Textile Exchange on the Responsible Wool Standard.
to manage our supplier relationships and enable them to aspire to greater sustain -
ability performance.
As well as guidance, these standards 
and policies also help us address mate -
rial risks and opportunities in a con -
sistent way. It is with our standards and policies that we are setting the bar and 
defining what kind of company we want to be.
For more information on our material 
issues and how we defined them, see  
p. 110. We have grouped the key sustain-
ability standards and policies most mate -
rial for this report into the areas below, see more on p. 112. 
HOW WE DEVELOP OUR STANDARDS 
AND POLICIESWe have a set process in place for develop -ing our standards and policies. First, we identify a need, risk or opportunity, which is done either via an internal or exter -
nal source. We then develop a standard in response with the help and input of experts and relevant stakeholders from 
inside and outside our business. Next, 
we create an implementation plan for the new standard, as outlined in the section 
below. All of our standards are regularly 
reviewed and updated.STANDARDS & POLICIESIntroductionGOALS & ACTIONS OVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION  / HOW WE WORK WITH OUR STANDARDS AND POLICIES / OUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY / OUR CODE OF ETHICS / OUR SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT / ANIMAL WELFARE AND MATERIAL ETHICS / CHEMICAL RESTRICTIONS / SOCIAL POLICIESTHE H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 90 OF 124HOW WE REPORT ABOUT THE H&M GROUP VISION & STRATEGY 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE 100% FAIR & EQUALStandards & Policies
How we work with our standards and policies
Whenever we implement a standard or policy, 
we create a tailored strategy for making sure it 
has been done so correctly and effectively. Our 
follow-up methods therefore vary per policy or standard. When we discover non-compliance, we 
take action; our response depends on the issue 
and severity of the breach. 
The content of the sustainability standards and 
policies, except for the social policies described  
in this chapter, are owned by the Global Sustaina -
bility team who also coordinate different policies and oversee their implementation. The Global HR team is responsible for the social policies and 
oversees implementation and follow-up. It is the 
responsibility of relevant local business functions to follow up and take any required action. There  
is also a dedicated person for each standard/policy that is responsible for the implementation and updating the standard/policy whenever needed.
Another system that helps ensure our standards 
and policies are upheld is our grievance report -
ing mechanism. Internally, we have an open-door principle that encourages employees to talk to managers to solve issues. 
We ensure every employee has access 
to a formal grievance procedure. Any grievances that cannot be solved 
locally are escalated to the senior 
management of the H&M group or raised through the global grievance 
email address.
We also have a whistleblowing 
system for anyone to report serious 
cases of corruption suspicions or violations of our business ethics. 
We believe it is important to be 
accountable and transparent, so 
we report any findings through the 
right channels and to relevant stake -
holders. All relevant information is 
shared through our sustainability 
report, which also includes our human rights reporting. We are continously working to 
integrate new learning and develop our 
standards and policies. This helps us 
work in a sustainable way, reduces our negative impact and where possible, 
enhances our positive impact.

We can group our main sustainability standards and policies into three ‘categories’: our own internal operations, our supply chain, and our products and material use. Our business activities connect with human rights in internal operations and across our 
value chain, either through business partners or in connection to the material and/or processes used to make our products. Below, we describe our main and most significant sustainability policies and standards. More can be found at sustainability.hm.com .Our sustainability standards and policies overview

Our Human Rights Policy 
Our approach
These activities and decisions can include 
everything from the data integrity of customers and 
how we treat our employees to the raw materials in 
our products and working conditions in factories.
We have operations and suppliers in countries 
where serious human rights breaches may occur so we need to be proactive in our protection of them. 
We want our policies and standards to go beyond 
our formal, legal responsibilities for human rights to help ensure respect for human rights across our 
operations and value chain, leading to positive 
change for the communities and people we touch.
Our approach to human rights is based on the  
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights (UNGP) and the recognition that while 
states have a duty to protect human rights, compa -
nies have a responsibility to respect the same.  
Our Human Rights Policy applies to all entities within the H&M group.Respect for human rights is a funda-
mental part of any successful business. 
Our business activities and decisions 
can impact people and their human rights both directly and indirectly,  
as well as positively and negatively.

Human rights due diligence 
Our aim is to ensure that our human rights due 
diligence is conducted in a systematic and consist -
ent manner and to continuously ensure that human rights is an integral part of relevant processes. This is an important part of our Human Rights Policy 
and meeting our responsibility to respect human 
rights in practice, as well as to ensure we act with accountability. 
For the H&M group, human rights due diligence 
is the ongoing process to identify, address (which 
means to prevent, mitigate and/or remediate 
human rights risks and impacts connected to our business) and account for how we respect human 
rights in practice. We integrate multiple processes 
for our assessment of risks to human rights, for example, risk management and business partner 
due diligence. Other key components of our human 
rights management include stakeholder engage -
ment, grievance handling, internal training and 
external reporting.Key processes and activities integral to our human rights management 
include: 
–  Our process for identifying and 
reviewing our salient human  rights issues.
–  Our annual sustainability risk assessment, conducted by all  
business functions.
–  Business partner due diligence  prior to entering a new contract.
–  Country sustainability risk assess -
ment for both production and retail 
markets.*
–  Supply chain management/ business partner follow-up  through SIPP material/process/
product risk assessment.
–  Incident-handling routines with integrated analysis according to  
the UNGPs.
–  Our in-depth training on UNGPs and our Human Rights Policy.

process to further ensure that the risk of human 
rights abuses connected to new and existing mate -

systematised a method to identify and prioritise

addressed. This updated process will be put into practice in 2017.

Embedding respect for human rights throughout 
our business activities is about continuously work -
ing to put our Human Rights Policy into practice. Our aim is to ensure that a human rights perspec -
tive is a natural, integral part of how we operate 
and make decisions across all business functions. 
Internal training is a key step in the process of increasing awareness and competence. 
We run ongoing in-depth training on human 
rights, our responsibilities as per the UNGPs, 
human rights due diligence and handling of cases, 
situations and incidents with a human rights impact. We prioritise training for key positions and 
roles, for example, sustainability managers in our 
production markets and country managers, as well as key business functions such as sustainability 
department, HR and legal.Identifying and addressing 
human rights breaches: Our

When we identify a case of human rights impact, 
we respond with our incident management rou -

approach to analyse our responsibility according 
to the UNGPs and apply appropriate measures.* We make sure to integrate what we learn from analys -

How are human rights connected to the 
UN’s Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs)?    
Human rights are about the basic dignity 
and equality of all human beings. They 
are at the heart of what sustainable devel -
opment means for people. We cannot 
achieve the SDGs without respect for 
human rights.  
Why should human rights be at 
the center of a business strategy to 
contribute to sustainable development and SDGs?    
A company’s single greatest opportunity to Shift is a non-profit organisation that facilitates dialogue, builds capacity and develops  
new approaches with companies, governments, civil society organisations and international 
institutions to enable them to implement the UN Guiding Principles.

ble development lies in advancing respect 
for the human rights of workers and com -
munities affected by their business. 
 
What are some of the tangible  
outcomes from the companies that 
have reported according to the UNGP 
Reporting Framework since its launch 
in 2015? These companies are providing meaning -
ful explanations of how they understand human rights challenges as well as how they are tackling them and making improve -
ments. The reporting process also helps them improve their management processes and stakeholder dialogue.   
Are companies missing out on opportu -
nities when they are mainly focusing on 
reducing the negative impacts?   
When a company takes serious steps to 
tackle negative impacts in its supply chain 
it isn’t just ‘doing no harm’. It is realizing an opportunity to empower people, lift them 
out of poverty or abuse and enable them 
to enjoy real development while reducing 
business risk at the same time. 
What else can the H&M group do  
to increase our positive impact on 
human rights?
The key to wide-scale positive impact 
is two-fold: collaborating with others to 
address systemic human rights problems 
and scrutinizing the company’s own busi -
ness model and purchasing practices. The 
H&M group should continue to do both. STANDARDS & POLICIESGOALS & ACTIONS OVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / HOW WE WORK WITH OUR STANDARDS AND POLICIES / OUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY / OUR CODE OF ETHICS / OUR SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT / ANIMAL WELFARE AND MATERIAL ETHICS / CHEMICAL RESTRICTIONS / SOCIAL POLICIES

Corruption is a challenge in 
many of the markets where we 
operate. We have a strong anti-
corruption programme in place, apply a zero-tolerance policy 
and take a proactive approach 
towards preventing corruption. 
At the H&M group, we make it a rule to 
always act with integrity. To make our 
expectations clear to our employees* and 
business partners, we have a Code of Ethics for each, which often goes beyond 
the strictest regulations and legislation 
in our markets.
We set an expectation of mutual trust 
and transparency in all of our business relationships. Our Code of Ethics under -
pins this, as does building awareness, providing education and maintaining a no-gift policy. We accept no gifts of 
any form from any business partners, 
regardless of value. This keeps everyone objective when doing business on behalf 
of the H&M group. We have an open-door 
policy for reporting any violations of the Code of Ethics. We have had our Code of Ethics in place 
since 2003. In 2012, we updated it to 
clearly state that any kind of bribery (including facilitation payments) will 
always be addressed and may lead to the 
termination of our business relationship. By taking a firm line on refusing to accept 
any kind of contribution or bribery, we 
aim to encourage others in our markets to share our values. We are focusing on 
high-risk countries such as Cambodia, 
Bangladesh, India and Russia where we provide training and awareness build -
ing activities. High-risk countries are identified through our own assessments and through external sources such as 
the Transparency International’s Global 
Corruption Perception index. 
In 2016, we investigated and closed 39 
incidents** of potential non-compliance (2015:33, 2014:30, 2013:36). These 
investigations led to action in 26 cases 
(2015:25, 2014:18, 2013:18) of which 11 were terminations and 15 were warnings. 
This included both colleagues and busi -
ness partners. We currently have 11 open 
cases that are still under investigation. 
Investigations were conducted based on 
direct reports from our busness partners and employees who made use of our 
open-door policy, complaint procedure and whistleblowing instruments. Most of 
the cases concerned corruption, requests 
for money and personal favours as well as conflicts of interest and theft. There were no public legal cases regarding corruption brought against the company 
or any employees in 2016.**“  By taking a firm line on refusing to 
accept any kind of contribution or bribery, we aim to encourage others in our markets to share our values.

For employees
Our Code of Ethics (CoE) is the same 
around the world and is translated 
into all languages in the H&M group. 
It secures our position and makes it clear what we expect from employees 
when doing business on our behalf. It 
is mandatory for our Board of Direct-ors and senior executives, as well as 
all employees in contact with business 
partners, in-house consultants and staff classroom or online training on the Code of Ethics. The training provides a deeper understanding of the Code, including 
how it relates to daily work and how it 
helps employees know how to act when representing the H&M group in a busi -
ness context. To further extend this training, in 2016 we launched both a new e-learning module and a three-hour 
Dilemma Workshop. The latter involves 
hands-on practical examples of ethical dilemmas that managers, HR and pur -
chasing staff could encounter. So far, we have trained about 25 ‘master trainers’, who will now train and support other 
trainers throughout our operations. 
Thus far, 50% of concerned employees have taken the new e-learning course.
We follow up on reported incidents 
thoroughly. If a violation is reported, 
the security department will start an 
investigation. Anyone who deliberately violates the Code of Ethics will receive a 
warning and can, in serious cases, lose 
their employment. 
As above, we have a whistleblowing 
procedure in place whereby potential breaches can be reported confidentially, 
anonymously and without any risk  
of reprisal.
from employment agencies (and simi -
lar) to sign our CoE. To maintain this 
process in a systematic way, signing the 
Code of Ethics is routine procedure when entering new employment contracts. The 
Code includes guidance on advantage 
(i.e. taking bribes or gifts), conflicts of interest, confidential information and 
company assets. 
We also make it mandatory for employ -
ees who sign the CoE to undergo either All of our business partners sign our 
Code of Ethics. Partners include any 
business that supplies us with goods 
and/or services, acts on behalf of our business or has a collaboration with 
us. Partners include suppliers, vendors, 
consultants, landlords, agents, service providers and organisations. To date, 
100% of our commercial goods suppliers, 
our biggest group of business partners, have signed our Code and received dedi -
cated training. 
We provide training on the Code of Ethics 
for all new commercial suppliers. This 
training focuses on our zero tolerance of bribery and corruption, gifts and hospi -
tality as well our position on confidential information and compliance.For business partnersStandards & PoliciesSTANDARDS & POLICIESGOALS & ACTIONS OVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / HOW WE WORK WITH OUR STANDARDS AND POLICIES / OUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY / OUR CODE OF ETHICS / OUR SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT / ANIMAL WELFARE AND MATERIAL ETHICS / CHEMICAL RESTRICTIONS / SOCIAL POLICIESTHE H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 99 OF 124HOW WE REPORT ABOUT THE H&M GROUP VISION & STRATEGY 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE 100% FAIR & EQUALStandards & Policies
Our Sustainability Commitment
We launched our Sustainability Commit -
ment (SC) on 1 February 2016. It replaced 
our Code of Conduct, which had been in 
place since 1997. With the SC, we want to take our work to support our business 
partners and their sustainability work to 
the next level. We want to move beyond compliance and promote sustainability 
performance at our suppliers and further 
down the supply chain. The SC is shared by all brands within the H&M group and 
everyone who has a business relationship 
with us must sign it if they want to start or continue working with us.*
Over the years, the scope of sustainabil -
ity issues has grown and with that, so 
has our sustainability work. The Sus -
tainability Commitment clearly commu -
nicates all of the areas we are committed to work on to make our supply chain 
more sustainable. It also expresses how the H&M group wants to work together 
with all of our business partners to 
advance sustainability when it comes to healthy workplaces, healthy ecosystems 
and animal welfare. We want to grow 
with business partners who share our values and are willing to work transpar -
ently with us to improve their social and environmental performance.
Our Sustainability Commitment is complemented by the SIPP, our Supplier 
Impact Partnership Programme. The 
SIPP supports suppliers in improving their sustainability performance and 
helps us monitor and measure suppliers’ 
compliance against the fundamental and aspirational levels and assess the level 
of implementation of our Sustainability 
Commitment.Compliance with the law is fundamental for all businesses, but with our Sustain -
ability Commitment we are saying ‘it doesn’t stop there’. To be successful in the future, we must continuously push 
beyond compliance to more aspirational 
improvements. That is why our SC has two levels of performance: fundamental 
and aspirational.
The fundamental level is the basic com -
pliance level that we expect all business 
partners to meet. The aspirational level demonstrates where we want to go in the 
long term through constant improve -

The SIPP is our Sustainable Impact 
Partnership Programme. We started 
using it in 2015 to support our business 
partners to become more environmen -
tally and socially sustainable. The SIPP 
represents a shift from a relationship 
that is focused on compliance to one that is about dialogue, collaboration 
and progress towards shared long-term 
goals. By working together, we can drive positive impact in the value chain. 
We use the SIPP to assess the sustain -
ability performance of our business 
partners and to identify ways to support 
them. The programme brings together our leadership principles of trans -
parency, innovation and reward. It is designed to reward the extra mile, drive business partner ownership of sustain -
ability, encourage performance beyond compliance and show how sustainabil -
ity can drive business performance.
EMPOWERING BUSINESS PARTNERS
We want our business partners to take 
ownership of their sustainability per -formance because we believe it is the 
best way to achieve long-lasting and 
sustainable change. The SIPP empow -
ers our business partners to do this. 
We use the SIPP to follow up on our 
business partners’ implementation of both levels of our Sustainability 
Commitment – compliance and aspi -
ration.* We share the expectations and 
guidance that will help our business 
partners aspire beyond meeting the 
requirements of local laws and interna -
tional conventions. 
When they ‘take ownership’, business 
partners set their own goals, priorities 
and focus areas. They provide us with 
self-assessment data and then act on the results. We work with them to iden -
tify areas where the H&M group can best provide support through, for exam -
ple, capacity building and training. 
Our business partners self-report 
through the SIPP and we validate the 
results and give them back to the part -ner. This component of SIPP is closely linked with SAC’s Higg facility mod -
ules. We were one of the first brands to 
incorporate the Higg facility modules** 
(both environmental and social) into 
our supply chain. The main advantage of this is that all brands can use them, 
so business partners only need to com -
plete one assessment rather than sev -
eral brand-specific ones. This makes factory assessments fairer and more 
comparable, regardless of the brand.
HOW WE WORK WITH THE SIPP 
We use the SIPP to ensure a ‘minimum requirement assessment’, which we 
physically carry out before starting a 
relationship with a business partner, and then repeat when a facility is visited 
as part of our programme (see Becoming 
a H&M group business partner on  
p. 103).
A facility is approved after it meets the 
minimum requirement assessment.*** 
Its sustainability performance is then 
self-assessed annually. Its overall Supporting our business partners

modules. The facility module is used by manufacturers to measure social and environmental performance in their facilities. ***‘Fundamental requirements’ and ‘minimum requirements’ are similar, but not the same – the former expects a slightly higher level or performance than the latter. We will use the term ‘minimum requirements’ to be consistent throughout the rest of this report.STANDARDS & POLICIESGOALS & ACTIONS OVERVIEW / INTRODUCTION / HOW WE WORK WITH OUR STANDARDS AND POLICIES / OUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY / OUR CODE OF ETHICS / OUR SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT  / ANIMAL WELFARE AND MATERIAL ETHICS / CHEMICAL RESTRICTIONS / SOCIAL POLICIESTHE H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 101 OF 124HOW WE REPORT ABOUT THE H&M GROUP VISION & STRATEGY 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE 100% FAIR & EQUAL
performance and country risk assess -
ments, amongst other indicators, 
will help us to determine the level 
of validation that is needed for each factory. For high-risk and new business 
partners, we perform an onsite check 
at least once a year. If the business partner is low risk (i.e. they achieved 
a high score on the audit), a ‘desktop 
validation’ is usually sufficient. This involves checking data and paperwork 
for anomalies and inconsistencies. We 
assess each business partner’s capacity to both manage their sustainability 
issues and track actual performance 
using environmental and social sus -
tainability metrics.
We have rolled out the SIPP to all of 
our manufacturing and processing 
business partners. These units have 
performed self-assessements or joint assessments, and we have validated 
the results via desktop and/or onsite 
visits. For second tier suppliers, we have conducted joint assessments on 
the component units producing 56% 
of our production volume. These joint assessments are done with our busi -
ness partners to educate and create ownership.As described above, we use the Higg facility modules in our SIPP assess -
ments. Although these modules are up and running, they are still in develop -
ment. Therefore, for now, we include 
some of our own sustainability perfor -
mance (KPI) questions in the assess -
ment to provide a more comprehensive and balanced review.
OUR SUSTAINABILITY INDEX
One of the outputs of this assessment 
is our Sustainability Index (SI). Each factory is given an SI score between 
0 and 100 (based on the Higg facility 
module and our own KPIs) and is then ranked according to their environ -
mental and social sustainability performance. 
Since we are currently updating this, 
we are unable to share aggregated SI scores in this year’s report. However, 
as we receive scores, we will com- 
municate and further integrate them into our purchasing decisions.

group also provides capacity building,

Through these relationships, we 
encourage our suppliers to develop

performance with long-term business 
commitments and growth opportu -

bring mutual benefits such as joint capacity planning up to five years in 
advance. We have over 3,000 of our

relations with our business partners. 
Their focus is on building strong, long-
term business partner relationships that are characterised by trust and

Stakeholder interview with our business partner
How long have you been a H&M group 
partner?  
We started processing some partially prepared products back in 2000, so we’ve been working with the H&M group for 16 
years. Today, between 70% and 80% of 
our total output is specifically produced for the H&M group brands.
What value does social dialogue bring 
to your factory? 
Social dialogue facilitates communication 
between workers and managers and the H&M group has helped us see the value 
of this. Social dialogue leads to increased 
profit margins, customer satisfaction and happier, more productive and loyal employ -
ees. Through communication, we are learn -
ing how to solve problems together.
How has the H&M group supported you 
in achieving this?The H&M group provided lots of training for 
our workers to help them understand their 
responsibilities and their rights, and how social dialogue can help them. The H&M 
group also arranged for third-party consult -
ants to visit our factory and give onsite guid -
ance. As a result, our workers have success -fully elected worker representatives and 
know how to approach them with problems. 
In the long run, our factory will become 
more productive, which will increase our profits and drive down costs. 
How do you think this will help you in 
the future?
The H&M group is helping us understand 
the importance of sustainability and how 
social dialogue is a part of this. We have 
a growing understanding of sustainability 
issues and this approach is starting to spread throughout our factory. Although 
we make mistakes, we know the H&M 
group will help us understand how to correct them ourselves, so that we can 
continue to be partners for a long time.

Animal welfare and material ethics
We believe that animals are entitled to 
humane treatment and to having their 
basic needs met. Our Animal Welfare Pol -
icy outlines our responsibility to source 
animal-based raw materials in a way that 
meets tough requirements and is fully 
traceable. All of our suppliers must meet high standards of animal husbandry and 
fulfil our animal welfare requirements.
Our Sustainability Commitment requires 
all relevant suppliers to follow our  
animal welfare and material ethics 
requirements. Any product that involves 
animal-based materials and merchandise 
must follow a checklist of strict routines and instructions to ensure that the policy 
is being followed. We regularly train any 
merchandisers that work with suppliers when it comes to compliance and trace -
ability documentation. For example, we have introduced the new wool standard to our supply chain and established rela -
tionships further down our supply chain including the farm level to make sure our 
supply chain is ready for responsible wool 
standard certification.
We also train our suppliers in our animal 
welfare and material ethics policy – both as part of the onboarding process, and 
through refresher courses. We conduct 
random bi-monthly checks to ensure that compliance and traceability documen -
tation is being collected and verified for each order.

Our chemical restrictions are, as a 
minimum, always based on the highest 
legal standard in any of our sales coun -
tries, as well as on information from 
authorities, NGOs and scientific reports. 
Our Restricted Substances List is one of 
the most comprehensive in the apparel industry. 
We have separate restriction lists for our 
various product groups. These include 
packaging, apparel, cosmetic products, 
candles, aerosols and toys. Our Man -
ufacturing Restricted Substances List 
(MRSL) focuses on chemical use in 
factories. The Restricted Substances List (RSL) is focused on chemicals found in 
finished products. We have conducted 
nearly 44,500 chemical tests together with our business partners to ensure 
compliance with our RSL.
In line with our ambition to imple -
ment a clean factory approach (i.e. zero 
discharge of hazardous chemicals) in our supply chain by 2020, we will guide 
and support our facilities in phasing out 
restricted chemicals used in production by setting up specific timelines. 
When suppliers sign our Sustainability 
Commitment, they are also committing 
to comply with our chemical restrictions, including our MRSL and RSL. This 
means it is the supplier’s responsibility 
to assure compliance with our restric -
tions and we expect our suppliers to 
implement it into their supply chain and 
with subcontractors.

We are present in many markets around 
the world. We are expanding rapidly and 
recruiting new employees every day. Our 
success depends on our people. 
Our social policies, such as our Global 
Policy on Diversity, Inclusiveness and Equality and our Global Non-Dis -
crimination and Harassment Policy, are founded on our respect for human rights and on UN and ILO conventions, 
amongst others. They set the minimum 
expectations for the H&M group and complement our company values. These 
policies contain clear directions that help 
managers and employees to meet daily business needs, understand how to work 
and act towards business partners and 
create fair and equal working conditions in safe and healthy workplaces.
Our global policies set the minimum 
standard regardless of local legislation 
where we operate. Whatever gives the 
greatest protection for all colleagues is always the guiding principle.
The H&M group must be a place where 
customers and colleagues feel safe and 
our goal is to achieve a yearly compliance status of at least 85% compliance  
annually with safety and security in  
our stores.
The 2017 goal for the global store audit, 
which consists of safety, loss prevention 
and information security, is 85% compli -
ance. In 2016, we completed 8,930 store 
audits and the global store audit result 
was 85%. The safety area result of the global store audit was 87% compliance 
across all stores and brands. We have 
identified employee training as the area with most opportunity to improve our 
compliance rates. Training our employ -
ees includes how to work safely, prevent 
losses and comply with local legal safety 
training demands and we are working 
with HR to improve this further in 2017.

IntroductionHow we report
We are committed to transparent report -
ing on the progress we make towards 
meeting our sustainability strategy.
The H&M group’s Sustainability Report is pro -
duced annually and covers our material sustain -
ability strategies, challenges, activities, goals and 
performance for the global group operations of H&M Hennes & Mauritz AB (also called the H&M 
group in this report), including all its brands 
(H&M, H&M Home, COS, Weekday, Monki, Cheap Monday, & Other Stories), as well as its wholly- or 
partially-owned subsidiaries globally during our 
financial year from 1 December 2015 to 30 Novem -
ber 2016, unless stated otherwise. (For a full list 
of entities, please see our Annual Report 2016). 
We aim to address key impacts (positive and neg -
ative) across our value chain, and this is reflected 
in our reporting wherever possible. Information limited in scope to only one of these brands or 
any other limitations or deviations in scope are 
clearly stated in the respective section of this report. Unless stated, franchise operations are not 
included. The report was reviewed by the highest 
executive management and external assurance has been performed for selected indicators (clearly 
marked where applicable, as well as in regards to 
materiality and stakeholder engagement). Addi -
tional stakeholder comments and interviews have 
been included throughout this report. All data is collected by our sustaina -
bility team from the relevant func -
tions within our organisation and 
from external parties such as suppli -
ers or implementing partners. This 
data is always reviewed by our inter -
nal controlling team, relevant experts 
in our sustainability team and expert 
functions following a two-tier quality 
control principle. Any extrapolations or estimations are clearly indicated. 
The same goes for any changes in 
data methodologies or scope that may influence data comparability. 
All data is based on the best possible 
systems that are currently available 
to us, and where applicable aligned 
with recognised standards. However, this needs to be seen in the light of 
continued improvements in data sys -
tems, methodologies and scientific 
uncertainties. For example, while 
our GHG emissions accounting and 
reporting is aligned with the GHG Protocol, the emission factors we use 
are from publicly available sources 
such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Network for Trans -
port Measures (NTM), Reliable dis -
closure system for Europe (RE-DISS) and supplier specified emission 
factors. GHG emission data is subject to inherent uncertainties due to 
incomplete scientific knowledge 
used to determine emission factors 
and resulting effects on measure -
ments and estimations. The reported 
energy usage is based on invoiced 
data, data from real-time electric -
ity meters and data as reported by 
transport providers. Conversion 
between fuel usage and energy content has been done using energy 
values specified by the supplier or 
by using tabled values provided by national bodies. 
Our material reporting requires 
us to make assumptions on waste 
factors, weight per sizes, etc. We are 
continuously working to improve those aspects of reporting that may 
lead to minor updates in our yearly 
material consumption reporting. For this year, the material data has been 
restated due to the fact that histor -
ical data has been updated using a 
new, more detailed system. We are 
continuously working to improve our 
data systems and accuracy to report on material consumption.
Unless otherwise specified, all data 
concerning suppliers and supplier 
factories includes all suppliers and factories that were active and 
approved for production during the 
reporting period. Factories included 
in our scope are first tier manufac -
turing or processing (i.e. washing or 
dyeing), factories that are owned or 
subcontracted by our suppliers, and, where stated, selected second tier 
suppliers and suppliers for non-com -
mercial goods (such as store interior 
suppliers). The second tier suppliers 
we have selected so far are mostly 
fabric and yarn suppliers that account for about 56% of our products.
Monetary amounts are reported 
mainly in the currency of transaction 
(usually SEK). Additional currency 
values are conversions as approxi -
mate figures based on the conversion 
rate on 30 November 2016, unless 
stated otherwise.

UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES REPORTING  
FRAMEWORK
In 2015 we were one of the first compa -
nies in the world to report on human 
rights in line with the UN Guiding Princi -
ples Reporting Framework. This frame -
work is the first comprehensive guidance for companies to report on human rights 
issues in line with their responsibility to respect human rights set out in the 
UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights. The detailed references to the UN Guiding Principles Reporting 
Framework can be found at sustainabil -
ity.hm.com
Below, we set out our approach to 
assessing the materiality of sustainabil -
ity issues for our business and how we Report was based on the following steps:
1. Identification: Mapping aspects  
and creating a gross list 
We regularly update a gross list of 
aspects based on an analysis of external 
standards, such as the GRI Standard topic list, legislation, investor and  
NGO questionnaires, peer reviews, business intelligence, lifecycle assess -
ment results, stakeholder dialogues and 
stakeholder reports, and media cover -
age. The gross list has been checked 
against GRI’s Sustainability Context 
and Stakeholder Inclusiveness tests.
2. Prioritisation: Scoring and  
prioritising topics** To prioritise the most material topics 
from this gross list, we scored the differ -
ent aspects in regards to their influence 
on stakeholder assessment and decisions, and their significance for economic, envi -
ronmental and social impacts. Both cat -
egories were broken down into a number of different categories, such as frequency 
raised by key stakeholders (weighted x3), 
frequency featured in media (weighted x1) and frequency raised in key sustaina -
bility benchmarks, rankings and indices (weighted x1) (to determine the influence on stakeholder assessment and deci -How we report
supplement this for human rights with the identification of our salient human 
rights issues, based on an understanding 
of risk to people. This process to define our salient human rights issues was comprehensively conducted in 2015 and 
included many internal and external 
stakeholders. Going forward, we plan to conduct this comprehensive process 
every third year, or as deemed necessary. 
Annually, we will review the relevance and definitions of the issues identified 
and discuss additional emerging issues.
PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING THE  
MOST MATERIAL TOPICS AND THEIR 
BOUNDARIES*
During 2016, we aligned our materiality matrix with our new sustainability strat -
egy. We developed this strategy in close dialogue with external and internal key 
stakeholders and updated our previous 
materiality matrix with key takeaways from this process. We reviewed scores 
provided for all relevant aspects and 
added several new aspects to our materi -
ality assessment. In line with our strate -
gic ambition to take a leadership position on sustainability, we also expanded the boundaries for some aspects. This scor -
ing process to define the report content and the aspect boundaries from our 2016 sions), as well as social and environmen -
tal impacts (weighted x1) and importance to business strategy (weighted x2) (to 
determine the significance of economic, 
environmental and social impacts). Scores were given by at least two inter -
nal experts per category and were based on lifecycle assessment (LCA) data and existing strategy documents. 
During 2016, we reviewed the gross list 
and added further aspects based on the 
analysis described under step 1, which 
were also in line with our new sustain -
ability strategy. We reviewed previous scoring for several aspects based on feed -
back received from external and internal stakeholders as part of the development process of our new sustainability strat -
egy. In this way, about 17 topics were identified as material. For the sake of 
user friendliness, these were themati -
cally clustered into 26 focus areas and 
gathered in a materiality matrix on  
p. 112. In line with our new strategy, 
some material topics were re-grouped in these focus areas. Some new material 
focus areas were identified, and some 
previously identified ones underwent minor adjustments. The impact scoring 
and boundary descriptions were checked 
against the GRI’s reasonability tests.

REVIEW OF MATERIALITY MATRIX  
IN 2016
We gathered feedback on our 2015  
sustainability report from various  
stakeholders. This included a review of the materiality matrix and no objections 
or concerns were raised. Through close, regular dialogue with our stakeholders, 
and as part of the process for developing 
our new sustainability strategy, we  
have incorporated additional forward-  
looking strategies and priorities into  
our matrix. For 2017, we plan to conduct more stakeholder surveys, helping us to further validate our materiality assess -
ment and further integrate stakeholder feedback in our strategy development  
and decision-making processes.How we report
3. Regular review of our materiality matrix with key stakeholders*
We conducted a broad validation of our 
matrix and assessment process in 2013. We selected at least one representative 
from each of our key stakeholder groups 
(which includes customers, colleagues, communities, suppliers and their 
employees, industry peers, NGOs, IGOs, 
policymakers and investors). Eleven stakeholder representatives were asked 
to provide feedback on this materiality 
matrix. These organisations were chosen based on their expertise, their ability 
to make professional and critical judge -
ments and on the coverage of aspects that were potentially material. 
While updating our sustainability 
strategy, we also adjusted our materiality 
matrix based on feedback from internal as well as external stakeholders involved 
in this process. The feedback widely 
confirmed the material topics presented, and no topics were considered missing. 
Updated priority scoring of each of these 
topics resulted in some adjustments in the position of the scatter in relation to 
each other. This concerns for example

How we report
Our salient human rights issues
The H&M group conducted a thorough 
process of identifying its salient human 
rights issues in 2015. Salient human 
rights issues are the human rights at risk of the most severe negative impact 
because of our operations and sup -
ply chain. This process supplements 
our materiality analysis in the area of 
human rights, with an understanding  
of risk to people.
We started out by defining who we 
impact through our business activities throughout our value chain, especially 
recognising those who potentially are 
more vulnerable and hence are more at risk, such as migrant workers, women and children. The result of this mapping 
was a list of both potential and actual 
human rights impacts. From this list,  
we identified those which were salient 
by applying two criteria: the severity of 
the potential impact and the likelihood 
that this impact will occur.
Consultations regarding the method 
and input to the identified salient 
human rights issues were held (both internally and externally) with almost 
100 people. Internally, consultations 
were held through workshops and dia -
logues on all levels of the company and 
across functions. Externally, consulta -tions were held with experts, organisa -
tions, academia and local stakeholders. This process does not only guide us 
on the human rights issues relevant to report on according to the UNGP’s 
Reporting Framework, it also informs 
our strategies and work to address these issues going forward. To ensure our list 
of salient human rights issues remains 
relevant, we will review these issues annually, and the full process, including 
input from external stakeholders, will 
be conducted approximately every three year, or more frequently if necessary. 
While we take steps to mitigate all risks, 
salience guides us in what to focus on within human rights and hence informs 
our strategies and work. 
The most recent review took place at 
the end of 2016 and resulted in slightly 
adjusted definitions on for example social security, highlighting that we 
refer to social security linked to employ -
ment. We also expanded child labour to 
the broader children’s rights, due to the 
various ways our activities directly and 
indirectly impact children, while still recognizing child labour as an issue of 
great severity.

SALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUESWHERE IN THE VALUE CHAIN THE ISSUE IS  
A MORE PROMINENT RISK EXAMPLES OF ACTIONS 2016 AND WHERE  
TO FIND MORE INFORMATION
FAIR LIVING WAGE
A wage level covering workers and their families’ basic needs and provides 
some discretionary income. Mainly in the supply chain.We take a collaborative approach to improving wages in the garment industry and continued to drive and  advance our Fair Living Wage strategy, see p. 76. Link to goals, actions and results in 2016, see pp. 68–69.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Working conditions that ensure the well-being and safety of workers  and employees.In the supply chain and internal operations. Compliance figures and management system scores of SIPP (see link: sustainability.hm.com ). Review, revision and 
update of our Global Health & Safety Policy, p. 73. Continued engagement in the Accord in Bangladesh, p. 81 and 
bangladeshaccord.org .
FORCED LABOUR
All work or services that are exacted from any person under the menace  
of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself/herself 
voluntarily (ILO Convention 29)Potential risk in the supply chain, often linked to specific raw materials  
and processes but also a potential risk connected to internal operations,  
for example,  in connection to staff outsourcing.Modern Slavery Statement for the financial year 2015/2016 (go to sustainability.hm.com  for full statement).  
Continued engagement in the ETI initiative addressing exploitative labour practices in Tamil Nadu in India – especially targeting the Sumangali Scheme, see p. 80. Joined the AMCO, Amsterdam Coalition – an initiative to engage in 
addressing Sumangali Scheme in India, see p. 80. Conducted a modern slavery gap analysis (see link: Modern Slavery Statement ). Updated our annual Production Human Rights Due Diligence Process, see p. 93. Updated our 
Material Risk Assessment for new and existing materials, see p. 80. Internal training on modern slavery held by  the ETI, see p. 80. Continued ban on Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Syrian cotton, see p. 91. Continued engagement 
in the Better Cotton Initiative, see p. 48.
DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT
In hiring and/or in the workplace – Discrimination: unfair or humiliating treat -
ment on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, race, colour, age, preg -
nancy, marital or social status, religion, political opinion, nationality, ethnic 
origin, disease or disability. Harassment: humiliating or corporal punishment or subject to physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse.A risk in the supply chain, where, for example women’s rights are of great 
importance to recognise due to the large share of women in the garment 
industry. Also of great importance for own operations.Updated our Global Diversity, Inclusiveness and Equality Policy. Introduced the minimum requirement on policy regarding anti-discrimination in recruitment and anti-discrimination/harassment/abuse for business partners of 
commercial goods. See p. 84 and our supplier compliance site .THE H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 115 OF 124ABOUT THE H&M GROUP STANDARDS & POLICIES VISION & STRATEGY 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE 100% FAIR & EQUAL

SALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUESWHERE IN THE VALUE CHAIN THE ISSUE IS  
A MORE PROMINENT RISK EXAMPLES OF ACTIONS 2016 AND WHERE  
TO FIND MORE INFORMATION
CHILDREN'S RIGHTS
The rights of children as per the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(UNCRC), which sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health and  
cultural rights of children. Child labour is defined as work that deprives children 
of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to their physical and mental development (UN CRC, CRBP, ILO Conventions).Children are directly and indirectly impacted by business activities  
throughout the value chain. Child labour is a potential risk in the supply 
chain, especially in connection to specific raw materials. Myanmar project with CCR CSR on child labour, see p. 81. Continued engagement in the Better Cotton Initiative, BCI. Link. Conducted a comprehensive assessment on mica in cosmetic products to support strategy development 
and our approach to mica and the likely risk of child labour associated with mica production in India, p. 81.  
Updated our Materials Risk Assessment for new and existing materials. See our Child Labour Policy .
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
A person’s right to join, and/or form, organisations of his/her own choosing 
and to bargain collectively (ILO Convention 87, 98, 135, 154). Mainly in the supply chain but also relevant for own operations.We take a collaborative approach to achieving well-functioning industrial relations through a Global Framework 
Agreement with IndustriALL and IF Metall, which was renewed in 2016. Continued to drive and advance our  
Industrial Relations Strategy, including advocacy efforts in production markets like Bangladesh and Cambodia,  
see p. 75. We also have a Global Framework Agreement  with UNI Global Union.
SOCIAL SECURITY
Social security involves access to health care and income security, particularly in cases of old age, unemployment, sickness, invalidity, work injury, mater -
nity or loss of a main income earner.Mainly an obligation belonging to the responsibility of the State as defined 
by the UN Guiding Principles, but relevant especially in supply chain countries 
and some retail markets, where lack of legal frameworks or institutional capacity sufficiently addressing this issue is common.Continued to address the issue of short-term contract in Cambodia to pave the way for undetermined duration contracts that will improve access and coverage of social security and increase the likelihood of workers organising 
and engaging in unions to negotiate conditions, see p. 80.
Ensuring work permits for Syrian refugees in Turkey, entitling them to the same social security as Turkish workers, 
see p. 80. 
WORKING HOURS
Working hours that comply with national law, the ILO conventions or  
collective agreement, whichever affords the greater protection of the 
worker. Connected to the workers’ right to health and family life. Mainly in the supply chain countries due to high prevalence of overtime  
in the garment industry.Continuously monitored through our supplier assessment programme SIPP and linked to, and addressed through, our Fair Living Wage strategies. See p. 76 and supplier compliance site  for compliance figures and data.
ACCESS TO WATER
Safe water and enough supply, accessible and affordable for personal  and domestic use.Communities in both production and retail markets.Addressed through our work with water in our Water Stewardship programme, see p. 49. Apart from continuous implementation of this strategy, no further actions were taken in 2016.THE H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 116 OF 124ABOUT THE H&M GROUP STANDARDS & POLICIES VISION & STRATEGY 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE 100% FAIR & EQUAL

ness and civil society to address social 
and economic challenges. We welcome this 
collaborative approach and, as you can  
see below, our sustainability strategy is  
well aligned with the SDG goals. 
The nature of our business means we have 
the potential for both direct and indirect 
impact and influence on a wide range of SDGs. Progress towards our three ambi -
tions will create the most obvious impact – as outlined below. However, our partner -
ships and other areas of influence such

How we report
Given our business activities, 
these are the key SDGs  
to which our sustainability 
strategy contributes.
SDG5 – GENDER EQUALITY 
We want everyone connected 
to our business to have 
access to the same opportu -
nities – man or woman, girl or boy.  
We’re committed to making sure every -
one in our business and supply chain 
is treated equally, and to drive positive 
change across the rest of the industry.
SDG6 – CLEAN WATER  
AND SANITATION 
In line with our 100% Circular & Renewable ambition,  
we must manage water responsibly across our value chain. We have been  collaborating with the WWF since 2011 
on water stewardship issues and are  
currently developing a new roadmap  for our water goals and actions.
SDG7 – AFFORDABLE  
AND CLEAN ENERGY 
Our commitment to renewa -
ble energy will build capac -
ity and access, making it more available to more people and businesses around 
the world. Our goal is to source 100%  
of our total energy in our own opera -
tions from renewable sources, to encour -
age and empower our suppliers to use renewable energy and to explore ways 
to build capacity for new sources of 
renewable energy ourselves. 
SDG8 – DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH As a thriving, global business, 
we create jobs for millions 
of people around the world – a large 
percentage of whom are in developing 
markets. We will continue our efforts to 
ensure fair jobs for our colleagues, the people employed by our business partners 
and the people employed throughout our 
value chain. 
SDG12 – RESPONSIBLE  
CONSUMPTION AND  
PRODUCTION 
We are building circularity 
into our business in how we source, 
design and make our products, and 
how we dispose of our waste. With our 
vision of 100% circularity across our value chain, we are also empowering our 
partners and customers to adopt more 
sustainable patterns of consumption. SDG13 – CLIMATE ACTION 
We are eliminating fossil 
fuels from our operations and directly supporting the 
reduction of more greenhouse gases than our value chain emits. Our goal is to achieve a Climate Positive Value Chain 
by 2040 through a combination of energy 
efficiency, renewable energy and carbon sinking/offsetting.
SDG17 – PARTNERSHIP  
FOR THE GOALS 
Collaboration underpins our 
entire sustainability strategy. 
We are proactively seeking out and facili -
tating (often financially) the partnerships that will help solve the challenges we – and the rest of our industry – face.THE H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 118 OF 124ABOUT THE H&M GROUP STANDARDS & POLICIES VISION & STRATEGY 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE 100% FAIR & EQUAL

The H&M group is a 
customer-focused company. Understanding and meeting 
the needs of our customers 
is at the core of everything we do.The H&M group is closely connected with communities around the 
world in which our stores, 
offices and warehouses are located, and those that host our supplier factories.We want all employees to feel proud to work for the H&M group. Motivated and 
satisfied employees mean 
better customer interactions and a better and more productive workplace.Our suppliers are our  valued business partners. Stable and long-term 
relations are key to mutual 
growth. Strengthening and enabling their ownership over their sustainability issues is important in ena -
bling long-term sustainable 
development.Our suppliers employ over 
1.6 million people, most of them women in emerging 
markets. This provides 
a great opportunity to improve the livelihood of workers, their families and communities. Hearing their voices is essential to our 
work – and even more so 
helping to systematically give them a voice in fair and constructive negotiations and social dialogue.Many challenges are best addressed collectively. We work with industry peers 
and even companies oper -
ating in other sectors to 
define industry standards and common responses to shared challenges.The H&M group and our suppliers are subject to rules set by policy-mak -
ers. Maintaining dialogue with them helps us to stay informed about, and sometimes to help shape, our legal and regulatory context.We are striving to take a science-based approach as part of our sustainability 
strategy. Innovation is key 
to address some of our industry’s greatest chal -
lenges and opportunities. Therefore, engaging with academia and science is 
vital to our continued strat -
egy development and to 
meet our ambitious goals.NGOs are expert advisers on standards and practices throughout our value chain.
We rely on their expertise 
and independence to 
ensure that we meet the most up-to-date standards and to make us aware of any concerns.The H&M group is a publicly listed company. As such, we are accountable to our 
investors. We prioritise our 
most important investors in a direct dialogue wherever possible and integrate feedback we receive in our strategies and to inform 
our sustainability reporting, 
striving for the greatest possible transparency.

reporting guidelines as well as the Global 
Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Standards. As discussed in the section “How we report”, on p. 109 in the H&M group  
Sustainability Report 2016, greenhouse 
gas quantification is subject to inherent  uncertainty because of incomplete 
scientific knowledge used to determine 
emissions factors and the values needed 
to combine emissions of different gases.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express a con -
clusion on the above-specified indica -
tors in the H&M group Sustainability Report based on the limited assurance 
procedures we have performed. The selection of indicators to be reviewed 
has been made by the management of H&M Hennes & Mauritz AB. We do 
not accept, nor assume responsibility 
to anyone else, except to H&M for our 
work, for the limited assurance report, or for the conclusion that we have 
reached. 
We conducted our limited assurance 
engagement in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 ‘Assurance 
Engagements Other than Audits or 
Reviews of Historical Financial Infor -
mation’. The ISAE 3000 standard 
requires that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited 
assurance on whether any matters have 
come to our attention that would cause us to believe that the above-specified 
information in the H&M group Sus -
tainability Report 2016 has not been 
prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the reporting criteria.
A limited assurance engagement is 
provided only on the information

pages. The presented information in the H&M group Sustainability Report 
is to be considered in connection with the explanatory information on data 
collection, consolidation and assess -
ments provided by the H&M group. This independent limited assurance report should not be used on its own as a basis 
for interpreting H&M group’s perfor -
mance in relation to its principles of 
corporate responsibility.
Our review procedures are designed to 
obtain limited assurance on whether 
the above-specified indicators are 
presented in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of 
the Global Reporting Initiative, in all 
material respects. A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquir -
ies, primary of persons responsible for the preparation of the H&M group Sustainability Report and applying 
analytical and other evidence gathering

documented policies and procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards 
and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The procedures per -
formed consequently do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters 
that might be identified in a reasonable 
assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance 
conclusion.
 Our procedures are based on the 
criteria defined by the Management 
as described above. We consider these criteria suitable for the preparation of 
the Sustainability Report.
 We believe that the evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our conclusion below.  
CONCLUSION
Based on our work described in this report, nothing has come to our atten -
tion that causes us to believe that the information regarding the above-specified indicators in the H&M group 
Sustainability Report has not, in all 
material respects, been prepared in accordance with the reporting criteria 
stated above. Stockholm, 4 April 2017Ernst & Young AB

More information
Because of our updated strategy, this year’s sustainability report is in a 
new format compared with previous 
years. Most issues covered in previous reports are still included in this year’s 
report, but while we have made every 
effort to make the content as acces -
sible as possible, we appreciate some 
issues may be difficult to locate. A few 
issues have been removed because they were deemed not material 
enough to report on. 
If you have any questions about the 
report, need help locating specific 
information or want to find out the latest on our sustainability work 
including our strategy, goals, stand -
ards and policies, as well as success
