TRANSPARENT REPORTING SINCE 2002We can all acknowledge this past year has been a very 
unpredictable and challenging one. While we are hopeful  
for the future, our day-to-day existence is still very much affected by the impact the pandemic has on us all. Thanks to the efforts of our talented and committed colleagues, we have not let circumstances discourage us from staying true to our values, pursuing our goals and meeting our customers’ evolving needs.  
Although we have made good progress advancing our 
sustainability agenda, the last 12 months have further highlighted the importance of sustainability and the need to accelerate this work. We all need to play our part in transforming our industry into one that is genuinely built around circularity and social justice. While I know we have much work to do, I am inspired by what we have achieved  
so far and confident H&M Group can continue leading  
this change. 
A key part of our transition to a more circular fashion future is 
to make sustainable products and services more accessible, inspiring and affordable to our customers
 . This will le
ad to 
both strengthening our current relationships with our valued customers as well as attracting new ones
 . It will 
expand the 
lifecycle of products whilst making our business more resilient as we move into the next decade
 . 
Durin
g 2020 we have taken many positive steps
 . W
e’ve 
embraced new breakthroughs in fabric recycling technology — including the world’s first collection using the mixed-fibre textile recycling Green Machine, and the first commercial products made from Renewcell’s Circulose® 
 . These inno
vations show that 
garment recycling can be scalable and commercially viable, bringing us closer to our new goal of using 30 per cent recycled materials by 2025
 . T
o help us reach this and other circular goals, 
we’re embedding the principles of circularity into the design process and continuing to test and scale pioneering materials — including some made from textile, plastic and agricultural waste
 . 
W
ith the expansion of the second-hand platform Sellpy into new 
markets, and through launching new services such as COS Resell and Arket Rental, we are helping customers access and enjoy fashion in a more sustainable way
 .
W
e stand by our responsible purchasing practices and 
agreements with suppliers, and are in close dialogue with them in order to support their businesses during these uncertain times
 . A
t the same time, H&M Group’s updated wage strategy 
will take a localised approach to improving working conditions for the people in our supply chain
 . W
e’ve also had a big focus on 
advancing our inclusion and diversity work this year — including new partnerships, increased transparency, and improving representation across the business
 . 
W
e are continuing to increase transparency around our 
sustainability plans and performance, as well as the sustainability credentials of our products
 . I
’m particularly pleased we’re 
pushing forward with product transparency initiatives to help our customers make more informed purchasing decisions
 . — L etter from our CEO 
Helena Helmersson
CEO, H&M Group
H&M GROUP  —  S UST AINABILITY PERFORMANCE REPORT 20205
TRANSPARENT REPORTING SINCE 2002Furthermore, the highly successful launch of our sustainability-
linked bond in February 2021 is testament to the appetite for sustainability-driven initiatives
 . No
t only does this type of bond 
create another example of transparent commitments and incentives, it also contributes to the positive transformation of the fashion industry
 . The bond is link
ed to H&M Group meeting 
a number of sustainability targets, such as by 2025 reducing emissions from our own operations by 20 per cent
 . W
e are also 
committed to reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions from garment manufacturing, fabric production, upstream transport and raw materials by 10 per cent
 .
Ther
e’s much more to do, and our direction is clear  . W
e’ll 
continue inspiring and building meaningful relationships with our customers, offering more sustainable products and scaling circular business models
 . W
e want to empower everyone to be 
able to express themselves, to be proud of who they are and the choices they make
 . Bu
t we can’t do this alone
 . W
e need to 
continue working with others and build deeper partnerships within and outside our business
 . Our w
ork alongside close 
partners such as the Ellen McArthur Foundation, IndustriAll,  
WWF and the UN Global Compact, to mention a few, is vital to achieve this
 . 
As w
e continue with and accelerate our own transformation with 
a new sense of urgency given how the world is changing, I’m excited for the year ahead
 . B
y being open to new possibilities 
and embracing collaboration and partnerships, H&M Group has the power to change something much bigger than ourselves
 . 
W
e want to achieve sustainable growth that makes a positive 
difference to people and the planet  .
H&M GROUP  —  S UST AINABILITY PERFORMANCE REPORT 20206
TRANSPARENT REPORTING SINCE 2002COVID-19 has devastated communities and economies across 
the world, affecting people in different ways
 . Man
y of us 
have lost loved ones, many feel lonely or uncertain about the future
 . And a
s a business we’ve experienced the damaging 
economic consequences, including store closures and job losses
 . P
eople working in the fashion value chain have been 
particularly hard hit, with few alternative jobs available and limited social security
 . 
The p
ast year has accelerated changes already happening in  
our industry, including shifts in customer behaviour and expectations
 . It’
s hard to predict exactly how this will develop 
over the coming months
 . Bu
t it is clear that building even 
stronger relationships with our customers — beyond one-off transactions — and with the partners around us has been the key to getting through the pandemic and will be equally important to our recovery and future growth
 . Our on
going resilience requires 
us to increase our focus on circular business models, co-creation  
and operation within the planetary boundaries
 .
Impacts on our work
— The pandemic led to an 18% decrease in our net sales by the end of our financial year
 .
— Ther
e was a delay or pause in several sustainability-related 
activities — including garment collection programmes, some projects to scale innovative business models, finalising our Circular Product Development Guideline and microfibre strategy, and carrying out in-person supplier factory assessments
 . In
 
addition, the development of global science-based guidelines on biodiversity through a broad partnership between various global organisations and corporations has been delayed and is expected to resume in 2021
 . W
e will adapt our biodiversity 
ambition to these guidelines and engage in this conversation when it resumes
 .
— Man
y store openings due in 2020 were delayed or cancelled, 
and we had to permanently close or refit more stores than planned
 .
— Supply chain imp
acts included factory closures and reductions 
in future orders
 . W
e’re in close dialogue with several partners to 
support suppliers, with the aim of finding a sustainable, whole-sector solution
 .
Our response
— Despite the challenges of the pandemic, we have accelerated our sustainability work on many fronts, including setting new goals, evaluating our wage strategy, developing our work on issues such as biodiversity, continuing investments in innovation, and trialling and scaling further circular business models
 .— R esponse to the COVID-19 pandemic  
H&M GROUP  —  S UST AINABILITY PERFORMANCE REPORT 20207
TRANSPARENT REPORTING SINCE 2002— T eamwork and partnership — with our colleagues, partners 
and suppliers — were central to our response to the pandemic
 .
— Our fir
st priority was employee and customer health and 
safety, and we cooperated closely with the relevant authorities in all markets
 . Our glo
bal crisis team coordinated efforts, 
collaborating with local teams to work with colleagues, customers, suppliers, landlords and communities
 . R

about how we supported employees
 .
 
— T o support our suppliers and work towards a more resilient supply chain, we joined the International Labour Organization’s Call to Action and we stuck to our responsible purchasing practices
 . R
ead more about how we worked with suppliers
 .
— T
o support healthcare workers, we donated protective 
equipment or coordinated its production (with buyers paying our suppliers directly), including:
 
 – 100
,000 face masks to Spain and Italy  .
 
 – 3 million lon
g-sleeved aprons to Sweden, alongside basic 
clothes for nurses and doctors to change into at work, to limit the risk of contamination from bringing their own clothes
 .
  – 130
,000 surgical masks and 1,000 coveralls to Indonesia
 .Learnings 
— During the pandemic, we’ve been reminded of how valuable and vulnerable the jobs in our value chain are
 . W
e’ve also seen 
a reduction in the negative environmental impacts caused by businesses and people
 . W
e’re determined to support job 
creation, strengthen social protection and build a more resilient supply chain in the wake of the pandemic, but also to build back better so that environmental impacts don’t increase with economic growth
 .
— B
y working closely with all our stakeholders, we’ve recovered 
more quickly than anticipated and continued to accelerate existing work to transform our business, increase our online sales and customer base, invest in sustainability, and set ambitious plans for the future
 .
W
e’ll use these lessons to continue working towards a more 
sustainable fashion industry  . It’
s difficult to know how severe 
the longer-term economic consequences of the pandemic will be, but our company and our industry have an opportunity to emerge from this crisis even more resilient and sustainable
 . H&M Foundation actions
— H&M F oundation donated 500,000 USD to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, to support the World Health Organization’s work to prevent, detect and respond to the pandemic
 .
—
 As p
art of a long-term project supporting women 
garment workers in Bangladesh, the H&M Foundation provided emergency relief to combat the social and economic hardships of the COVID-19 pandemic on these workers and their households
 . This vulner
able 
group has been hugely impacted by the effect of the pandemic on the ready-made garments sector
 . 
E
fforts by H&M Foundation’s partners CARE, Save the 
Children and WaterAid have reached almost 100,000 women
 . In a
ddition, 1 million people in Bangladesh 
have been reached with messages on COVID-19 and good hygiene practices

How we describe suppliers
Our supply chain is complex and can contain several different levels or ‘tiers’, depending on the material
 . 
The tw
o we talk about most in this report are tier 1 
and tier 2 suppliers, with whom we have the closest relationships and the most influence:
Tier 1. Manufacturing suppliers and subcontracted 
factories, who make our products by cutting, sewing and processing
 . 
T
ier 2. Suppliers who provide the fabrics and yarns for 
our products, including spinning, tanning, and fabric dyeing and printing facilities
 .
W
e also work with raw material suppliers — even if 
we don’t know the location of every farm, we can influence the selection of raw materials in line with our social and environmental standards

TRANSPARENT REPORTING SINCE 2002Our sustainability journey 
For over 70 years, we’ve worked to make great fashion 
accessible to people around the world
 . And w
e’ve taken 
significant steps to become a more sustainable company  .  
Bu
t we need to move faster to make sustainable fashion an 
everyday option for everyone
 .
Our indus
try and the world around us have undergone 
transformative change over the last decades
 . Glo
balisation 
has led to growth and a more connected world
 . D
igitisation 
has changed how we work and shifted customer behaviour by creating new opportunities for interaction
 . And no
w we’re 
seeing a rapid shift in awareness and interest in sustainability: companies and customers alike are seeing their impacts on the world more clearly and learning how to behave more sustainably
 . 
These chan
ges have opened up new opportunities and 
challenges for our business
 . W
e’ve continued to evolve and 
lead our industry towards a more sustainable future that offers customers more conscious fashion choices
 .
2020 ha
s brought new urgency to this transformation
 . The
 
COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the wake of the accelerating climate crisis
 . The r
esurgence of the Black Lives Matter 
movement was a stark reminder of the inequity that still exists in the world
 . And on
going political instability continues to create 
uncertainty about the future
 . These e
vents demonstrate why we must work even harder to move towards resilient, equitable business models
 . 
W
e believe our sustainability strategy focuses on the right areas, 
but we need to accelerate the speed of change and develop a new mindset to achieve our ambitions at the pace required
 . 
W
e call this mindset meaningful growth
 . It’
s about growing in 
ways that make a difference to our colleagues, our customers, our business and our planet
 . W
e’ll achieve this by placing our 
customers in the centre and integrating sustainability into everything we do
 .
W
e will grow by strengthening our core, always having a 
customer-centric view, and by creating further customer value
 . 
W
e are developing our business to grow in new ways, through 
new business models
 . F
or example, we’re creating shared 
services and collaborative platforms that use the power of technology to enable our business and our industry to make more sustainable choices
 . And w
e’re investing in experiences 
and services to engage with customers in new ways, as we invite them to be part of a circular fashion ecosystem
 . 
B
y harnessing the current energy around sustainability and 
social justice, we can generate impact outside our own company and lead a movement that goes beyond fashion — built on partnership, purpose and the opportunity to create a better world
 .With our ability to influence change, combined with our deep sustainability knowledge gained in the past years, we have the opportunity and responsibility to empower people across our value chain and lead our industry towards a sustainable future
 . 
And tha
t’s what we intend to do

play many roles within and beyond the complex ecosystem 
of the fashion industry  . It’

— T o better understand demand for circular business models, we surveyed 3,630 customers in Germany, Japan, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States to understand attitudes towards different circular fashion models — from buying pre-owned clothes to repairing garments
 . Sec
ond hand, vintage and pre-owned services were most commonly used (by 39% of customers), with 24% of customers using these services ‘often’ or ‘sometimes’

otal scope 3 carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2e) 
emissions were 17 ,387 kilotonnes (1
 .6% decr
ease versus the 
previous year)
 . The CO
VID-19 pandemic led to store closures 
as well as reduced orders and production over several months, lessening emissions from these sources
 . Sinc
e our scope 3  
data is currently delayed by one year due to data availability,  
this will not be seen until the next report  . The incr
ease in  
scope 1 + 2 came from aligning our renewable energy sourcing with the new RE100 market boundary criteria that led to a decreased percentage of renewable energy and an increase in our scope 2 emissions

 . 
Progress: renewable energy
— 90% o f electricity purchased for our own operations was renewable (96% in 2019)
 . This r
eduction is because we aligned 
our sourcing of renewable electricity with the new RE100’s market boundary criteria: these were introduced mid-2019 after we’d secured renewable energy for 2020, some of which does not meet the new criteria
 . T

H&M GROUP  —  S UST AINABILITY PERFORMANCE REPORT 2020
TRANSPARENT REPORTING SINCE 200242Washing garments can release tiny plastic fibres — microfibres — 
into water systems
 . These end up in oc
eans, where they pollute 
habitats and can eventually appear in drinking water and food
 . 
Micr
ofibres are mostly released from synthetic fabrics, but the 
dyes and treatments used for natural materials can also shed fibres
 . It’
s a significant issue throughout the fashion industry, 
from material washing and processing during production through to customer product use
 . 
W
e’re committed to researching and addressing the issue of 
microfibre emissions
 . As p
art of our approach, we:
—
 D
esign yarns and fabrics to minimise microfibre shedding and 
seek alternative materials
 .
—
 In
vestigate new production processes and requirements to 
minimise shedding
 .
—
 P
rovide customers with repair services and microfibre-
reducing laundry bags, and support the development of laundry machine filter systems

 . 
Progress
— T ogether with the Hong Kong Research Institute of T extiles and Apparel (HKRIT A), we started our 24-month research  
project — A Management T ool for Microplastics from T extile Production Process
 . W

microplastic content is ongoing (the COVID-19 pandemic delayed some sample collections)
 . 
—
 H&M br
and and ARKET continue to offer laundry bags that 
capture microfibres before they enter water systems
 . 
Learnings
— W orking with HKRIT A, we’ve studied how best to take representative water samples and extract microfibres
 . F
or 
example, we experienced sample loss as the smallest fibres can pass through sieves
 . W
e’re now testing other ways to 
separate microfibres
 .—
 Garmen
ts made completely from biodegradable fabric cannot 
be seen as the one solution to microfibre shedding, because these often have chemical finishes added which can hinder the fibres degrading

solution
 . W

 The majorit
y of brands (& Other Stories, COS, H&M brand and 
Monki) implemented programmes to reduce waste by reusing interior and building materials in new stores and refurbishments
 . 
—
 W
e partnered to use innovative new materials for interiors and 
construction
 . F
or example, COS collaborated with designers who 
created new materials from waste, including supplier Really to create solid textile boards, saving 3,198 kilograms of fabric waste
 . 
W
e also worked with bioMASON® and its bioLITH® brick made by 
microbes, instead of using cement  . This r

Discover how else we’ve used dust, waste and 
old yoghurt pots in our efforts to become a circular business in this Report Story .Learnings
— W e learnt a lot about scaling use of innovative materials  . F or 
example, Monki and COS found that not everything is scalable and it’s important that innovative materials conform to standard size fixtures, to design out waste
 . 
—
 W
e improved our understanding of how best to collaborate 
with industry partners
 . F
or example, we gained insight from 
the Group’s ongoing journey to assess suppliers’ social and environmental performance, and COS learnt how to scale circular business models with suppliers — including how to return materials to suppliers for refurbishment or become feedstock for new materials

TRANSPARENT REPORTING SINCE 200248In a circular future, waste will be redefined as resources  . T oday, 
we work towards eliminating waste, focusing on three key areas:
—
 O
perational waste. Reuse or recycle waste generated from 
our offices, stores and distribution centres, and offer effective 
waste management and recycling facilities
 .
—
 P
roduction waste. Better management of waste generated by 
our suppliers, by following our guidelines focused on reduction, reuse and recycling
 . 
—
 F
aulty products. Prohibit destruction of faulty products that 
could be sold, used or recycled
 . If w
e cannot sell a product, we 
reuse it, give it to charity or recycle it  . W
e never send clothes to 
landfill and only destroy them in very few cases,1 where there are 
no other options
 . 
W
e work hard to ensure that unsold products never end up as 
waste  — read more about how we maximise product life

 – Shar
ed our new Responsible Waste Management Guideline 
with all suppliers
 . 
 
 – La
unched the AI tool Movebox, an algorithm that enables 
redistribution of products to locations where there is demand
 . 
L
ooking ahead, using this algorithm will also make it possible 
to react faster to changes in customer preferences, leading to further improved production to demand
 .
  – Off
ered made-to-measure jeans in Stockholm, with unspun  
and H&M Group Laboratory  . The CO
VID-19 pandemic 
delayed the full launch of this service to customers until 2021,   
but H&M Group friends and family were able to experience the limited launch of the in-store Body Scan Jeans service to customise their jeans, which were then made to order
 .
 
 – Con
tinued exploring ways to minimise waste during design 
by cutting kids t-shirts and menswear from the same pieces of fabric at COS
 .— T o reduce waste from damaged products and returns, we:
 
 – T
urned old fabric into new products
 . H&M br
and 
released a second collection made from remanufacturing unsold products
 . COS used ma
terial left over from unsold 
products and cutting waste from its supply chain for the Repurposed collection
 .
  – Enabled cus
tomers to purchase renewed, previously 
damaged, garments by scaling COS Restore to nine stores, with The Renewal Workshop
 .
Learnings
— T esting a new functionality in our computer-aided design programme used by patternmakers and technicians during the design stage shows potential to significantly reduce fabric waste
 .

TRANSPARENT REPORTING SINCE 200249The fashion industry needs to move from a linear to a circular 
business model, with lower greenhouse gas emissions
 . We
 
want to shift from one-off transactions with customers towards more meaningful relationships by providing accessible ways to experience and engage in circular fashion — where products are used more, repaired, reused and recycled
 .
W
e work to ensure the durability of everything we make through 
our groupwide quality and durability standards, and we test and scale new tools, processes and services that maximise the value of the resources that go into our products
 . Our f
ocus is on 
product use, care and repair — where we empower customers to prolong product life — and on product reuse and recycling, where we take responsibility for recirculating products so they are used more
 .
Ensurin
g unsold products never become waste is a priority for 
us — we want the resources that go into producing a product to be valued, used and reused
 . W
e increasingly apply predictive 
artificial intelligence tools to match production to demand
 .
When 
a product isn’t selling, we take all actions possible to 
sell products within our primary sales channels, before using products within internal circular initiatives or brands such as Afound
 . When in
ternal possibilities are exhausted, we find 
solutions via trusted business partners
 .Progress: use, care & repair
— W e helped customers extend the life of their products and encourage them to keep garments for longer, for example:
 
 – H&M br
and offered repair and alteration services in eight 
stores
 . Cus
tomers in 46 markets (seven markets 2019) can 
access tips and inspiration on how to repair, adjust, wash  
and care for products, with seven markets also offering a  
T ake Care product range
 .
  – W
eekday held a launch day for ‘body-scan’ jeans , 
with unspun
 .
  – & Other S

care products
 . 
Progress: reuse & recycling
— W e expanded ways customers can rent products, for example:
 
 – COS c
ontinued partnering with market-leading platform 
Y closet to offer subscriptions to rent clothes in China
 .
  – H&M br
and expanded rental options to customers in Berlin 
and continued offering services to Hello Member club members at its flagship Stockholm store in Sweden

 W
e continued to recycle garments when other reuse options 
were not possible, for example: 
 
 – W
e worked with I:CO  to offer garment collection services 
across brands for reuse and recycling
 . CO
VID-19 disrupted 
these services, resulting in much lower collection volumes because customers couldn’t use in-store services
 . Of the
 
18,800 tonnes of garments collected in 2020, 50-60% were sorted for re-wear or reuse, and 35-45% were recycled to become products for other industries or made into new fibres
 . F
or example, ARKET and I:CO created an upcycled 
collection using post-consumer recycled denim
 . As a la
st 
resort, we disposed of the remaining 3-7% that could not be reused or recycled, prioritising incineration for energy recovery and never sending textiles to landfill
 . Our Cir
cular Innovation Lab trialled recycling such material into board for in-store garment collection boxes and display material with upcycling company Really
 .
  – Monki pioneer
ed mixed-fabric recycling technology by 
releasing a collection featuring recycled material from the Green Machine, developed by HKRIT A and H&M Foundation
 . 
It 
is the first machine that can fully separate and recycle 
cotton and polyester blends at scale with no quality loss
 .
  – H&M br
and worked to change customer perceptions of 
garment recycling, also partnering with HKRIT A and the H&M Foundation
 . Cus
tomers in Stockholm can now watch 
as unwanted garments are transformed into new clothing by a miniaturised in-store Looop machine — familiarising customers with the potential hidden in their old clothing
 .
Learnings
— R euse, resell and recycle pilots show that we need to offer diverse options that are accessible to all customers
 . W
e’re 
still learning what works best, as well as adapting to the rapid changes caused by COVID-19 and increasing digitisation
 . 
—
 T
o scale pilots, we need to develop our internal information 
systems and improve the metrics we track to fully understand how best to maximise product life
 .Future focus

 . F
or example, we’ll focus on finding scalable 
resell solutions
 .

H&M GROUP .H&M GROUP  —  S UST AINABILITY PERFORMANCE REPORT 202059
TRANSPARENT REPORTING SINCE 2002Respect and support for human rights is at the heart of our 
culture and values, and cuts across everything we do
 . It’
s a basic 
responsibility that we uphold the rights of colleagues, workers and customers across our global value chain
 . 
Our upd
ated Human Rights Policy — guided by the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights — describes our commitment
 . 
W
e focus on salient human rights risks: those with greatest risk 
for severe negative impacts on people

 .Progress
— We finalised our revised Human Rights Policy — signed by the board in November 2020

legislation in the European Union
 . 
— In r

 .
— All k

 .
Learnings
— Actions by individual businesses are a vital part of creating change and addressing human rights issues, but we continue to see the limitations of our own due diligence processes in the context of political instability or systemic inequality
 . This
 
highlights the need to work with others to achieve meaningful change for complex or systemic issues
 .— Our r
apid response to the COVID-19 pandemic showed 
that we can mobilise quickly in times of crisis, particularly to safeguard the rights of the most vulnerable people in our value chain
 . W
e were reminded of the effectiveness of cross-functional 
collaboration and joining with peers to tackle global issues
 .
— Glo
bal events such as COVID-19 amplify human rights risks 
for already vulnerable groups — for example issues of health and safety, social security, forced labour, wages and working hours
 . This sho
ws the importance of robust supply chain risk 
management processes, so that we understand where increased risks from sudden global events are likely to have greatest impact, and can act accordingly
 . 
Future focus
— We will continue to integrate human rights management  
and due diligence across our business, with a focus on service supply chains, materials and  circular business models

TRANSPARENT REPORTING SINCE 2002Progress: overall
— Following the closure of our 2013 Fair Living Wage Strategy,  
we used 2020 to reassess our overall approach to fair jobs  
and wages
 . W
e committed to an external, independent 
evaluation, to understand what worked and how we could  
do better  .  
Greg Distelhorst and Jee-Eun Shin from the  
University of T oronto carried out a statistical analysis on an 
unprecedented volume of data from around 800 factories across our supply chain to assess the factory-level impacts of our strategy
 . 
Raymond Robertson from T exas A&M University 
examined this impact data and advised on how our next strategy can be more effective, taking account of the complexity of our production countries
 . The r
eview found that:
 
 – The c
omponents of our existing strategy reinforce each 
other and are all essential to achieve wage increases
 .
  
– Factory-level wage management systems at our suppliers 
led to a 2  .8% a
verage wage increase and workplace dialogue 
programmes led to a 2% average wage increase, compared to suppliers not enrolled in these programmes
 . When these
 
programmes are completed with the implementation of a wage grid
1, the total increase in wages was brought on 
average to 5% compared to suppliers that were not enrolled  
in these programmes
 .
  
– Wage management systems are where H&M Group can 
have most influence, but for maximum impact work is also needed on minimum wages and social protection on national level and productivity on factory level
 .
   
– Presence of trade unions had an average positive effect on 
wages of 5  .5% (
global average)
 .
Supporting our suppliers 
through challenging times
Evolving and unexpected global issues add further 
complexity to the experiences of those in our supply chain
 . W
e’re already seeing how disproportionately the 
climate crisis affects those in vulnerable situations
 .
 The CO
VID-19 pandemic further heightened existing 
economic and social risks facing our suppliers and their workers
 . W
e prioritised monitoring health and 
safety provisions at a factory level and honouring our responsible purchasing practices in accordance with our ACT commitments ( see page 66 )
 .
 
Along with other leading companies, we endorsed the ILO’s Call to Action, which sets priorities and commitments for collective action to support garment manufacturers and workers through the ongoing economic disruption caused by the pandemic
 . This
 
Call has initial goals of supporting supplier business continuity and wage payments to workers, and a long-term goal of establishing sustainable social security systems in several production markets

External expert feedback on 
our wage strategy 
“The research team was impressed with H&M Group’s 
efforts to collect wage data from its supplier factories 
since the early 2010s
 . Our k
ey finding was that the 
H&M Group wage programmes were associated 
with increased factory wages beyond what could be 
explained by wage growth over time in the studied countries
 . Our analy
sis also highlighted higher wages 
in garment factories where trade unions were present  . 
W
e see opportunities to gather new information about 
the distribution of wages in these factories: are the 
wages of the lowest-earners also increasing?”
— Greg Distelhorst and Jee-Eun Shin, 
University of T oronto
“I have been very impressed with the thoughtfulness, 
appreciation of nuance, and drive for impact of the 
H&M Group wage strategy  . The challen
ges are great 
and cannot be resolved easily  . The H&M Gr
oup 
strategy effectively targets wage challenges at all 
levels
 . The thr
ee factors that stood out during the 
evaluation were the willingness to adapt in ways that 
reflected what was working, the recognition that 
each country presents unique challenges, and the competence and dedication of the H&M Group team

 .
— In our annual supplier sur

anonymously, 96% of our suppliers said they consider H&M Group to be a fair business partner (96% in 2019)  .
— W
ithin the framework of the ILO Call to Action, we’re working 
with peers and other stakeholders to secure funding from financial institutions and donors, to support suppliers and their workers
 . The lon
g-term goal is to secure social protection for 
workers within eight priority countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Myanmar and Pakistan

— Our revised supplier Sustainability Index awards suppliers points based on the average wage they pay their workers — compared to the local minimum wage, increases due to inflation, and peer performance
 . These indica
tors have a significant 
weighting in the Sustainability Index, translating to increased business opportunities for suppliers and incentivising them to increase the wages in their factories
 .
— W
e continued to work with the Better Than Cash Alliance  
and BSR to scale digital wage payment in Bangladesh
 . D
igital 
payments are now available at 90% of our manufacturing supplier units in Bangladesh — disruption due to COVID-19 means we haven’t yet reached our 100% goal
 . The pr

wage payments to workers in our supply chain
 . 
— W
e made progress against our ACT purchasing practices  
commitments, including developing and rolling out our ‘SMV Estimation Application’ app to help our merchandisers ring-fence labour costs in price negotiations
 . The c
ost of a garment 
is divided into different costing blocks such as material, stitching, and labour cost
 . When w
e ring-fence the labour cost, we remove 
that part from the price negotiations so that the wages are never affected

the wages were slightly below the standard minimum wage level
 . Ho

 . 
Ov

with an exception for the month of April in some factories
 . As per a Go

workers who could not go to work for a certain number of days in May and June received 30 USD per month from the employer and an additional 40 USD per month from the Government

Gross average wages were consistently above the minimum wage, although they were lower than the 2019 average
 . F

paid according to local regulations — varying between 100% and 70% of the minimum wage

TRANSPARENT REPORTING SINCE 2002INDIA
There was a full lockdown from the end of March until mid-May  . In this period,  compensation 
to workers was set — following a Supreme Court judgment — on the basis of factory-level 
negotiations between employers and worker committees or recognised trade unions
 . 
Appr
oximately 30% of our suppliers’ factories set compensation at 100% of the minimum 
wage; approximately 5% at between 50% and 100%; approximately 40% at 50%; and the remaining 25% at below 50%
 . Ov
erall, the gross average wage in the first six months of 2020 
was above the minimum wage (with the exception of April), although the premium paid was generally lower than in 2019
 . 
In the fir
st three months of 2020, employment levels were in line with 2019  . F
rom April to 
June there was quite a significant reduction, mostly due to migrant workers being unable to return to factory work after temporarily going back to their home town
 .INDONESIA
The impact of COVID-19 was felt from April to June  . While 5 7% of the factories were able 
to maintain full operations, the other 43% had disruptions, with temporary full or partial closures
 . In these ca
ses, the compensation for workers was set — following Government 
directives — through negotiations with trade unions and/or worker representatives, with settlements that generally varied from 25% to 100% of the minimum
 . Some f
actories 
negotiated not to pay workers if they were not able to work  . Ov
erall, while wages remained 
in line with the local minimum wage regulations, the average of the first six months of 2020 shows a slight decline in the premium paid compared to last year
 . 
Emplo
yment levels at the beginning of 2020 were in line with 2019; from April to June,

The minimum wage in 2020 has not changed, because the Government postponed its 
planned update
 . The imp
act of COVID-19 and the regular holiday period both hit in April and 
all factories were closed for almost the whole month
 . Durin
g the closure period mandated by 
the Government due to COVID-19 , workers were compensated with subsidies equal to 40% of the minimum wage
 . These subsidies ar
e included in the data shown here
 . 
The gr
oss average wage in the month of April remained above the minimum wage
 . Ov
erall, 
the premium paid above the minimum wage in the first six months of 2020 remained at a level comparable to 2019
 . In April and Ma
y there was a reduction in employment numbers 
due to business uncertainty and workers being unable to come back to work after the April holidays
 . Emplo
yment increased again in June, returning to a level comparable to 2019  .
The political sit

wages and worker numbers in the months ahead
 .TURKEY
The impact of COVID-19 was felt mostly in April and partially in May and June  . Appr oximately 
70% of the factories worked partially, either with periods of total closure or with a rotation of the workforce capped at 30%
 . W
orkers in factories affected by COVID-19 benefited from 
Government subsidies that varied according to the specific circumstances of each worker  . 
These subsidies ar
e included in the data shown here
 . 
Ov
erall, gross average wages in the first six months of 2020 increased, partly as a 
consequence of the updated minimum wage
 . The pr
emium paid by the factories was 
consistent with 2019  .
Emplo

Learnings
— Impr ovements in data quality tools, visualisation and analysis increase our understanding of supplier strengths and weaknesses
 . This helps us mak
e smarter decisions, shifting 
resources and focus to where improvements are needed most  . 
W
ith efficient systems to monitor compliance in place, we can 
increasingly focus on continuous improvement  .— As the v erification programme for Higg FEM and FSLM has expanded, so has the need for quality assurance mechanisms to ensure consistent and accurate verification processes
 . W
e’ve 
been working with other SAC members to pilot and refine quality assurance protocols for implementation by independent verification oversight bodies
 .
—
 The suc
cess of our pilot using the SLCP tool for our supplier 
social assessments gives us confidence to scale up the FSLM using SLCP to all our suppliers
 .
Future focus
— W e’ll continue accelerating progress towards our goal of 100% of tier 1 supplier units within SIPP assessment scope completing verified FEM and FSLM by 2022
 . 
—
 W
e’ll continue to refine our Sustainability Index and close 
the data feedback loop so we can make better decisions about which suppliers to reward
 .

 The CO
VID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to secure our 
supply chain against sudden global events beyond our control

1 December 2019 – 30 November 2020  .Management’s responsibility 
The Management of H & M is responsible for preparing and presenting H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB’s 2020 group sustainability reporting in accordance with the reporting criteria as set out in the company’s own reporting guidelines as well as the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Standards
 . As discussed
 
in the document ‘Reporting Scope 2020’, greenhouse gas quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases, as well as reliance on secondary data
 . 
Auditor’s responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the above specified indicators in the specified documents based on the limited assurance procedures we have performed
 . The selec
tion 
of indicators to be reviewed has been made by the management of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB
 . W
e do not accept, nor assume 
responsibility to anyone else, except to H & M for our work, for the limited assurance report, or for the conclusion that we  
have reached
 . Our r
eview is limited to the above specified 
information, which does not include web-links, and to the historical information and does therefore not include future oriented information
 .— Auditor’s reportH&M GROUP  —  S UST AINABILITY PERFORMANCE REPORT 202083
TRANSPARENT REPORTING SINCE 2002We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance 
with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 ‘Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’
 . The IS
AE 3000 
standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance on whether any matters have come to our attention that would cause us to believe that the above specified information in H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB’s 2020 group sustainability reporting has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria
 .
A limit
ed assurance engagement is provided only on the 
information disclosed in H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB’s 2020 group sustainability reporting specified above, and not on information linked to and disclosed on other web pages
 . The
 
presented information in the H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB’s 2020 group sustainability reporting is to be considered in connection with the explanatory information on data collection, consolidation and assessments provided by H & M
 . This
 
independent limited assurance report should not be used on its own as a basis for interpreting H & M’s performance in relation to its principles of corporate responsibility
 .
Our r
eview procedures are designed to obtain limited assurance 
on whether the above specified indicators are presented in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative, in all material respects
 . A limit
ed 
assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primary of persons responsible for the preparation of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB’s 2020 group sustainability reporting and applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate
 . The pr
ocedures performed in a limited assurance 
engagement vary in nature from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden
 . The pr
ocedures performed 
consequently do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement
 . A
ccordingly, 
we do not express a reasonable assurance conclusion
 .
The firm applies ISQC 1 (
International Standard on Quality 
Control) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements
 . W
e 
are independent of H & M in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements
 .
Our pr
ocedures are based on the criteria defined by the 
Management as described above
 . W
e consider these criteria 
suitable for the preparation of the Sustainability Report  .
W
e believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion below  . Conclusion
Based on our work described in this report, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information regarding the above specified indicators in H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB’s 2020 group sustainability reporting has not, in all material respects, been prepared in accordance with the reporting criteria stated above
