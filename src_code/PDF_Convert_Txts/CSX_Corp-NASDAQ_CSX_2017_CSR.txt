Supplement. By making the most fuel-efficient form of freight transportation on land 
even better, we are marking the beginning of a new chapter for CSX. Last year we started to implement a new scheduled operating model to redefine the way we run the railroad. 
Driven by a focus on safety, service and reliability, CSX embarked on a rigorous 
mission to empower employees and enhance the effectiveness of our rail network. 
The overall objective of this new operating plan is to improve transit times and 
enhance reliability to create more consistent freight flows and a superior service product for our customers. 
As a result, CSX has changed the asset intensity of our operating model and created 
a more efficient and fluid rail network. This is providing our customers a more 
consistent service product and the communities we touch assurances that CSX is committed to operating safely and responsibly. CSX’s dedicated workforce finished 2017 with four months of service improvement based on key performance metrics, including train velocity, car dwell, on-time 
departures and on-time arrivals. With a constant eye on controlling costs and utilizing 
our assets more effectively, we have been reducing our carbon footprint, minimizing impacts on the environment and helping customers create a greener, more efficient supply chain. 
Given our team, our operating model and our commitment to execute to plan, I am 
more confident than ever in CSX’s ability to continue delivering sustainable, positive 
results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our shareholders and the communities in which we operate.

(a) Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by U.S. GAAP . Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The 
presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP . Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are presented in the 2017 Annual Report Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (b) Scheduled railroading reduces capital intensity, allowing CSX to effectively eliminate rolling stock capital through at least 2020, while maintaining our commitment to safety and reliability.99
