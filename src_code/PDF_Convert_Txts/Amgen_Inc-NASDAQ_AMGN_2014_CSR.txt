Amgen 2014 Environmental Sustainability Highlights
2
Robert A. Bradway  
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I am pleased to provide you with Amgen’s 2014 
Environmental Sustainability report. Amgen is at a very exciting time in its history. We are preparing to launch new medicines for patients suffering from serious illness and expanding the reach of our existing medicines as we enter new geographies. We are innovating new ways to manufacture medicines, and we are introducing new technologies to deliver these medicines to patients. This is important work for Amgen, our shareholders, and the patients we serve. We also believe it is important that we engage in these activities while remaining  
committed to sustainability. 
Amgen’s Next-Generation Biomanufacturing facility in 
Singapore is an excellent example of the strides we are making. Once licensed, this site will deploy new processes and technologies which conserve substantial amounts of water, curb carbon emissions, reduce the amount of solid waste generated and operate with a dramatically smaller footprint than conventional facilities. In a setting of new technology, we are building upon our established sustainability practices including green biology and green chemistry. 
Our sustainability achievements would not be possible 
without the efforts of staff members who have dedicated themselves to the company’s targets. Part of our commitment to all Amgen staff members is the creation of a work environment that stresses safety and wellness.
Consistent with our commitment, Amgen received a 
number of important sustainability acknowledgements in 2014. We were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time, and we maintained our position on the North America Index. The U.S. Green Building Council recognized our building design strategy by certifying our innovative drug product research center in Thousand Oaks, California, at the highest level—LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum. The Association of Energy Engineers recognized Amgen’s energy management strategy with its top honor, the Corporate Energy Management Award.
Thank you for engaging with us as we continue to 
improve Amgen’s sustainability performance. We value your input and invite you to share your thoughts through the feedback link on the report website. 
Robert A. BradwayLeadership Message3
The overall aim of our 2020 targets is to protect the environment, improve efficiency, and increase stakeholder 
value. Our targets are designed to track our progress through deliberate efforts—without influence from growth or contraction in our business. We created a portfolio of projects and initiatives that we specifically execute to bring results in our target areas. We track the performance of those projects and initiatives against a 2012 baseline, counting results of projects and initiatives confirmed through a formal measurement process.

We are integrating environmental sustainability practices throughout our company’s operations  
—from research and manufacturing practices to the design and construction of facilities. A mix of  
facility and process optimization combined with carefully selected technology creates results.

building design, along with pioneering new practices for biomanufacturing, are advancing Amgen’s ability to conserve water and energy, reduce waste, and limit carbon emissions.Sustainability in Action
Driving Sustainable Practices throughout 
the Value Chain
Amgen’s 2020 plan for environmental sustainability is focused on driving sustainable practices in the areas of research, development, and manufacturing; transportation and distribution; commercial operations; sourcing; and products and packaging. By integrating sustainability practices during the design process, we are achieving further efficiencies in our business while continuing to reduce our impact on the environment.
The Environmental Benefits of Next-Generation 
Biomanufacturing  
Amgen has pioneered Next-Generation Biomanufacturing technologies and improvements capable of producing the same output of drug substance as conventional facilities in a footprint that is one eighth the size. We plan to use this approach for the first time commercially following licensure at our new manufacturing center in Singapore, which opened in 2014. Next-Generation Biomanufacturing is expected to conserve water and energy by approximately 80 percent, reduce carbon emissions by approximately 75 percent, and significantly reduce the amount of solid waste produced compared with conventional biomanufacturing. Even though Next-Generation Biomanufacturing uses disposable technology, it is more environmentally friendly because it eliminates the need to repeatedly clean and sterilize equipment after use. Harnessing Data to Improve Energy Efficiency  
Buildings can be expensive to construct, but they cost even more to operate and maintain. Over time, wear and tear can compromise a building’s utilities with negative conservation impacts. In 2014, Amgen began to pilot the use of an integrated data management system at the corporate headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California, to harness data in the service of better building performance. The system monitors the utilities of all of the site’s buildings in near real time, collecting more than 60,000 data points, and conducts full diagnostics tests hourly. The system can even generate a work order if it identifies a problem. Ultimately, the system can help the company improve conservation, reduce carbon emissions, and save money while also extending the life span of our facilities. 
Drug-Product Development Building Earns 
LEED PlatinumThe U.S. Green Building Council recognized Amgen’s building design strategy by certifying our innovative drug-product development building at our Thousand Oaks, California, campus at the highest level—LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum. This is our third LEED certification in recent years and follows LEED-Certified designation for a drug-product manufacturing facility and LEED Gold rating for an office building in Thousand Oaks. Amgen’s building practice sets a high bar for sustainability, taking into account practices that work optimally for our biotechnology company. 5
Amgen staff approach opportunities to make environmental 
improvements with the same enthusiasm and rigor they apply to scientific challenges. Staff-supported improvements in technology and processes have created significant conservation benefits, saved financial resources, and earned many awards over the years. Amgen maintains a yearly Environmental Champions program, which honors numerous staff from around the company for their green actions. 
Reaching Out in the Community 
Amgen staff are avid volunteers, contributing to a number of environmentally beneficial events throughout the year. Amgen participates annually in the International Coastal Cleanup, a global volunteering opportunity in which participants clear waterways and beaches of trash while collecting data that supports the Ocean Conservancy in its goal of trash-free seas. Other environmental volunteering events that staff organize include Clean Up Australia Day and work parties at the Charles River and at Kendall Square in Massachusetts. 
The Amgen Foundation is deeply committed to fostering 
the next generation of scientific innovators, including our support of important initiatives that advance environmental education in our local communities. We also help to further staff contributions of personal time, energy, and talents to these important causes through Amgen Volunteers and the Amgen Foundation Matching Gift Program.Sustainable Commuting Staff commitment to alternative commuting modes at six North American worksites helped Amgen avoid approximately 536 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. Amgen supports carpools, vanpools, public transportation vouchers, bicycle commuting, and electric car charging where possible. 
Education for the Environment 
Amgen celebrated Earth Day at most of its US-based locations in 2014. Events encouraged staff to develop environmentally friendly habits both at work and at home in the areas of recycling, composting, waste reduction, energy efficiency, water conservation, and alternative commuting. Amgen’s Thousand Oaks, California, campus also held events in support of America Recycles Day. A special focus for 2014 was the promotion of greener practices in the labs such as the use of more environmentally friendly supplies and increased recycling. The success of our environmental sustainability plan depends on the creativity and resourcefulness of our 
staff who demonstrate their commitment to the environment both at work and in their communities.

CarbonConserving Resources
Conserving energy allows us to retain more financial resources for 
our core business of discovering, developing, manufacturing, and delivering innovative human therapeutics while helping us to reduce our environmental impact. Our strategy has been to complete utilities projects that provide substantial returns for both energy savings and carbon reduction across our network of facilities around the world. We also mitigate environmental impacts using sustainable practices and technology in the design and construction of manufacturing and office facilities. We have realized more than $21 million in cost savings and reduced carbon emissions by 94,000 metric tons from 2008 through 2014 by implementing specific energy conservation and carbon reduction projects.
We are making progress towards our sales fleet carbon-reduction 
target, raising the minimum fuel efficiency standard for vehicles year by year. We continue to expand the range of fuel-efficient vehicle choices available for mobile staff—and to rotate out less fuel-efficient vehicles.

Reducing Waste; Saving Water
Amgen has reduced waste by more than 1,500 metric tons from 
2007 through 2014. We continue to analyze data from waste audits conducted at our largest sites to shape initiatives for recycling and waste reduction. These initiatives have helped us to increase our rate of recycling from 35 percent to 50 percent from 2007 through 2014.
We use data from water maps developed for each of our sites 
to understand our most significant water users and identify new opportunities for conservation. A key component of Amgen’s water conservation program is a wastewater treatment plant at our manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico that has enabled an average of 74 percent of the treated wastewater to be recycled on-site each year. We also integrate low-water landscaping and smart-irrigation controls at a variety of facilities. Energy conservation projects lead to water conservation benefits.

Environmental Notices of Violation (NOVs) (w) # NOV 8 2 2 2 6Summary of Data—Notes
(a)Amgen has included data from 15 facilities covering energy and carbon, water, and waste. The facilities represent approximately 94 percent of Amgen’s worldwide facility space based on 
total square feet. Included facilities are in Thousand Oaks, California, US; Greenwich, Rhode Island, US; Boulder and Longmont, Colorado, US; Seattle and Bothell, Washington, US; Juncos, Puerto Rico, US; Louisville, Kentucky, US; South San Francisco, California, US; Cambridge and Woburn, Massachusetts, US; Burnaby, Canada; Breda, Netherlands; Dun Laoghaire, Ireland; and Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge, United Kingdom. This includes leased buildings where we have operational control over building infrastructure, including utilities. In 2011, Amgen acquired a facility in São Paulo. In 2012, Amgen acquired four companies: Micromet, KAI Pharmaceuticals, deCODE genetics, and Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals. In 2013 Amgen acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals. No data will be included for our São Paulo facility or for Micromet, KAI Pharmaceuticals, deCODE genetics, Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals, or Onyx Pharmaceuticals in this report, as we are still working through the integration process for these facilities.
(b)Measurement and verification of conservation and reduction projects for energy and carbon, water, and waste are based on adaptation of the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), Concepts and Options for Determining Energy and Water Savings Volume 1, EVO 10000-1.2007, April 2007. Project measurements are conducted using reasonable means, including direct measurements and scientific estimations as appropriate. Values for conservation and reduction projects represent year-over-year, cumulative and continuing avoidance based on a 2007 baseline, then rebaselined in 2012 to match the next generation 2020 Target design.
(c) Immaterial changes to 2007–14 data may have occurred due to refinements in calculations. All changes have been confirmed through a documented change control process.
(d)Direct energy use results from the operation of equipment that is owned or controlled by Amgen at the facilities listed in note (a). Data on the use of natural gas, propane, and diesel in boilers, furnaces, and HVAC are recorded from utility bills or purchase records. Data on the use of diesel in emergency generators are recorded from purchase records or meter readings and, in some cases, estimated from run-hours. Utility bills recorded in units of volume are converted to energy by using the Global Reporting Initiative Version 3.1, EN3 table, to convert volumes of primary sources (natural gas, diesel), or from specific fuel analysis data (diesel used in Juncos, Puerto Rico), and the US Energy Information Administration/Annual Energy Review Table A1 (propane). Energy from emergency generators recorded as run-hours is estimated using the manufacturer’s specified fuel-feed rate for each generator.
(e)Indirect energy use results from purchased energy in the forms of electricity and steam at the Amgen facilities listed in note (a). Data on the use of electricity and steam are recorded from utility bills. Utility bills for purchased steam that are recorded in units of mass (i.e., ‘lb steam’) are converted to energy by using the latent heat of evaporation from the saturated steam tables, then dividing by the efficiency of the supplier’s steam generator.
(f)Scope 1 carbon emissions result from direct energy sources defined in note (d). Additional Scope 1 Carbon emissions from our US sales fleet, executive air fleet, and fugitive emissions from chillers, coolers, and HVAC are found in the Other Carbon category in this data summary. Carbon data from natural gas sources are calculated using regional specific emission factors from US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-3 (US weighted average) for all US sites; from the Ireland UFCCC for Amgen’s facility in Dun Laoghaire, Ireland; from U.K. Defra/DECC’s 110819 Guidelines for Amgen’s facilities in the United Kingdom (Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge); from the NL Agency standard CO2 emission factors for Amgen’s facility in the Netherlands (Breda); and from the Methodology for Reporting 2013 /Ministry of Environment Victoria, BC, 2013, for Amgen’s facility in Burnaby, Canada. Carbon emissions data from propane and diesel fuel sources (except Amgen’s facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico) are calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Stationary Combustion-V.1.0 (August 2012). Carbon from diesel use in Amgen’s Juncos, Puerto Rico, facility are calculated using specific fuel analysis information and from US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-1. Carbon data from direct energy sources prior to 2011 were calculated using emission factors from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Stationary Combustion-V.1.0 (Jul 2009). Scope 1 emissions that are not included in this data summary include process-related emissions from cell respiration (carbon as a by-product) and pH adjustments (CO2 injection). Analysis of these sources in 2013 showed that cell respiration and emissions from pH adjustments are negligible (less than 0.1 percent of our total carbon emissions). 
(g)Scope 2 carbon emissions result from indirect energy sources defined in note (e). Carbon data from purchased electricity are calculated using emission factors from US EPA eGRID 9th Edition Version 1 (2010 data: eGRID subregion annual carbon output emission rate) for all US locations except Amgen’s facility in Puerto Rico, which has been determined using EPA GHG Report YE 2012 for Power Suppliers in Puerto Rico; from the Greenhouse Gas Division, Environment Canada (2006 data)-V.1.0 (April 2009) for Amgen’s facility in Burnaby, Canada; and from specific utility annual providers’ reports for Amgen facilities in the United Kingdom (Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge), the Netherlands (Breda), and Dun Laoghaire, Ireland. Carbon data from purchased steam are calculated using the Emission Factor for Natural Gas as identified in US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-3 (US weighted average) for Amgen’s facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Carbon data from indirect energy sources prior to 2011 were calculated using emission factors from US EPA eGRID2007 Version 1.1 for US facilities.
(h)The Other Carbon category contains additional Scope 1 and Scope 3 carbon emissions that are tracked. Carbon emissions from our executive air fleet are calculated using emission factors from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Transport-Fuel-Use (August 2012). Carbon emissions from our US sales fleet are calculated using emission factors from the GHG Protocol Emission Factors for Petrol passenger cars (volume) (GHG Protocol) = 8.81 kg/gal. Fuel use and mileage data are collected at the pump for each vehicle. Carbon emissions from our commercial business travel are calculated by Amgen’s travel provider using the Defra tool. Carbon emissions from Amgen’s material transportation have been provided by the carrier using its own specific methods. Fugitive emissions from process equipment (e.g., refrigerant from refrigeration and HVAC equipment) are calculated using emission factors from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Transport-Fuel-Use (August 2012). Processes are in place to maintain chillers, coolers, and HVAC equipment to prevent unintended emissions.
(i)Scope 3 carbon emissions are a consequence of the activities of the company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company. Scope 3 carbon emissions that are currently tracked include emissions from Amgen’s commercial business travel (air and rail) and material transportation.
(j)Commercial business travel was not tracked in 2007 or 2008. Material transportation was not tracked from 2007 to 2011. The accuracy of carbon emissions tracking from chillers, coolers, and HVAC improved in 2013 and will now be reported going forward.
(k) Immaterial discrepancy between values for total water fate and total water withdrawal is due to rounding and compilation of individual facility totals.
(l)Recycling rate is the proportion of waste that is recycled, composted, and reused compared with the total volume of routine, nonhazardous and hazardous waste generated. Diversion from landfill is the proportion of waste that is incinerated (both for energy recovery and not), landfilled, and treated compared with the total routine, nonhazardous waste generated.
(m)Treatment means the physical, thermal, chemical, or biological processes that change the characteristics of the waste in order to reduce its volume or hazardous nature, facilitate its handling, or enhance recovery.
(n) Nonroutine waste constitutes waste generated outside the normal operations of our facilities and consists mainly of construction and demolition waste.General

INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT 
Introduction and objectives of work  
Bureau Veritas North America, Inc. (BVNA) has been engaged by Amgen to conduct an independent 
assurance of selected environmental health and safety data included in Amgen’s 2014 Environmental 
Sustainability Report. 
This Assurance Statement applies to the related information included within the scope of work described 
below.  
The data presented in Amgen’s 2014 Environmental Sustai nability Report is the sole responsibility of the 
management of Amgen.  BVNA was not involved in the dr afting of the Report.  Our sole responsibility was 
to provide independent verification of the accuracy of selected information included in the Report.  
Scope of work
Amgen requested BVNA to verify the accuracy of the following environmental health and safety data 
summarized in Amgen’s Environmental Sustainability Repo rt for the Calendar Year 2014 reporting period:  
 Energy Use (Total, Direct and Indirect) 
 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Direct Scope 1 and Indirect Scope 2)  
 Water Withdrawal and Fate 
 Waste Quantities and Disposition 
 Injury and Illness Rate (Number of inju ries and illnesses per 100 staff members) 
 Lost Day Rate (Number of injuries with da ys away from work per 100 staff members) 
 Severity Rate (Number of days away  from work per 100 staff members) 
 Number of Environmental Violations 
Excluded from the scope of our work is any verification of information relating to: 
 Text or other written stat ements associated with Amgen’s 2014 Environmental Sustainability 
Report 
 Activities outside the defined verification period of Calendar Year 2014 
Methodology  
As part of its independent verification, BVNA undertook the following activities:  
1. Interviews with relevant personnel of Am gen regarding data collection and reporting systems; 
2. Review of Amgen’s data and information system s and methodology for collection, aggregation, 
analysis and internal audit of information used to determine the environmental data; 
3. Review of documentary evidence produced by Amgen;  
4. Audit of Amgen’s data traced back to the source for facilities located in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts and Thousand Oaks, California during site visits; and 
5. Review of the centralized data,  methods for consolidation of si te data and site data available in 
the centralized data management system during a visit to Amgen’s headquarters location in 
Thousand Oaks, California. 17Amgen Page 2 
Our assurance work was conducted in accordanc e with the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 and ISO St andard 14064-3 Greenhous e Gases - Part 3: Specification with 
Guidance for the Validation and Verification of Greenhouse Gas Assertions. In accordance with our 
internal procedures for limited assurance, we use these as our reference standards.  
The work was planned and carried out to provide data verification to a limited assurance level and we believe it provides an appropriate basis for our conclusions. 
Our findings    
On the basis of our methodology an d the activities described above: 
 Nothing has come to our attention to indicate t hat the reviewed information within the scope of 
our verification is not materially correct. 
 Nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the reviewed information is not a fair 
representation of the actual environmental and heal th and safety data for calendar year 2014.  
 It is our opinion that Amgen has established appropriate systems for the collection, aggregation 
and analysis of quantitative data, including energy use, direct and indirect GHG emissions, water 
withdrawal and fate, waste quantities and disposition, injury and illness rate, lost day rate, 
severity rate and number of environmental violations.  
 A summary of data within the scope of assurance for 2014 is attached.

If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we and our partners routinely obtain patents for our and their products and technology, the protection of our products offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our or our partners’ competitors. We depend on third parties for a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity for the supply of certain of our current and future products and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to some of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Our efforts to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. We may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our recently announced restructuring plan. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Inc. Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.Amgen Inc.
