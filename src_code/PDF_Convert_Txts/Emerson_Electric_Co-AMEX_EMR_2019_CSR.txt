 CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGECHAIRMAN’S  
M E SSAGE most critical industries  
around the world.
I’m proud of what we 
accomplished in 2019. United  
by our Emerson values, we 
combined our best-in-class 
technology and groundbreaking 
innovation to make a true 
difference in the communities  
and industries in which we operate. 
In this latest Corporate Social 
Responsibility report, we highlight 
how we did – and are continuing  
to do – just that. 
Through bold leadership across 
our company and within our two 
business platforms, Automation 
Solutions and Commercial & 
Residential Solutions, we are 
delivering environmentally 
responsible solutions that improve 
efficiency, reduce emissions and  
conserve resources to help 
customers achieve their 
sustainability targets. We are 
stewarding the many industries we 
serve through difficult regulatory By confronting the most complex 
and important issues facing the 
world in commercial, industrial 
and residential markets, we are 
driven to rise to that challenge 
while creating long-term value  
for all our stakeholders.
We take our role in the global 
business community – and our changes and technical complexity, 
empowering them to operate 
more safely and sustainably. 
Our technologies are helping 
advance human health, comfort 
and safety, and they’re enabling 
us to help protect food quality 
and reduce food waste in landfills. 
These tangible ways to impact our 
world inspire our global workforce 
to keep pushing for the next 
innovation and opportunity  
to make a difference. 
To us, operating responsibly means 
acting with integrity and ethics 
in every business decision – from 
reducing the environmental 
impact of our business operations 
to ensuring our supply chain lives 
up to our highest standards. In 
2019, as part of our ongoing work 
to further enhance shareholder 
value and ensure the strength of 
the organization, our Board of 
Directors began a comprehensive 
review of our operations, Dear Stakeholders,
This year, like those that came 
before it, we were guided at every 
turn by a laser focus on our values 
and our efforts to leave the world 
in a better place than we found it. capital allocation and portfolio. 
After completing this review, 
I’m extremely confident in our 
company’s position to drive near- 
and long-term success, as we have 
been doing for 130 years. 
In our business and manufacturing 
operations around the world, 
we are focusing more than ever 
on efficient use of energy and 
natural resources to help reduce 
the intensity of our company’s 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  
In 2019, we committed to 
reduce our GHG emissions by 
20%, normalized to sales, across 
more than 200 of our global 
manufacturing and shared 
service facilities by the year 2028. 
This bold and pragmatic target 
was developed in partnership 
with environmental experts 
to demonstrate real progress 
toward reducing emissions while 
accounting for growth and changes 
across our dynamic global business. 
During the 2019 fiscal year, we responsibility to pursue the 
highest standards of corporate 
citizenship – extremely seriously. 
With a presence across every 
major global region, we 
understand our opportunity 
to transform not only our own 
business operations, but also 
those of our customers in the 
2019 EMERSON CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT4
 CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGEmade noticeable progress by 
reducing our GHG emissions 
intensity by 5.8% from our 
baseline value, and look forward  
to continuing this important 
effort in the years ahead.
Technology continues to drive 
new efficiencies in processes, 
procedures and resource allocation 
every day. But it is also creating 
disruption in the workforce that 
demands a response. The training 
and skills required for success in 
the manufacturing workplace in 
particular are changing rapidly.
Emerson is committed to helping 
our employees, customers and 
future generations of workers 
adapt to these changes. We 
support our employees and 
customers with reskilling and 
upskilling tools and training 
programs for the current 
workforce. Our partnerships 
with educational institutions and 
nonprofit organizations – through 
Emerson-funded scholarships, grants and training opportunities –  
are helping prepare current and 
future workers with the knowledge 
and skills they need to succeed in 
their careers. And through our  
“We Love STEM” campaign and 
“We Love STEM Days,” we are 
raising awareness among  
younger generations about the  
job opportunities in STEM fields  
like manufacturing. 
We’re also partnering with 
leaders to help spread the 
workforce reskilling message 
across industries. I am pleased to 
co-chair the “Creators Wanted” 
campaign by the National 
Association of Manufacturers. This 
unprecedented, nationwide effort 
to reshape the nation’s perception 
of manufacturing has a goal of 
reducing the industry’s skills gap  
by 600,000 over the next five years. 
We are focused on nurturing the 
diverse communities in which we 
work and live. I’m proud of our progress to make our workforce and 
management ranks more diverse 
and our workplace more inclusive 
and reflective of our communities. 
Diversity and inclusion enable a rich 
and productive exchange of ideas  
that lead to the best solutions –  
undoubtedly a competitive 
advantage as we work to serve 
our customers. More than 12,500 
employees have participated in 
unconscious bias training since 
2016, and in 2019 we increased 
the number of certified global 
facilitators to more than 160.  
I am personally committed to 
Emerson’s continued efforts in 
this area, and I’m encouraged 
by the interest and enthusiasm 
surrounding our growing employee 
resource groups – Veterans,  
LGBTQ + Allies, Women in STEM and 
Blacks Reinforcing Diversity.
Our employees are the 
backbone of our business and 
our work to positively impact 
our communities. In 2019, we contributed time, funds and 
resources to more than 1,200 
charities, nonprofit organizations 
and educational institutions in 
the United States, and numerous 
others in China, India, the 
Philippines and other countries 
where we operate. Emerson, 
the Emerson Charitable Trust 
and our business units have also 
made contributions totaling 
more than $30 million globally to 
organizations focused on health 
and human services, education, 
culture and arts, and civic 
development, demonstrating 
our deep commitment to 
strengthening the communities  
we serve.
While this report focuses on our 
accomplishments in 2019, I would 
also like to thank our teams across 
the globe who have continued 
to drive these efforts and critical 
operations during the ongoing 
COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic . The safety of our employees is 
our top priority, and we worked 
together as an organization to 
enact additional safeguards and 
policies to protect our dedicated 
workforce while meeting our 
customers’ critical needs. Our 
customers and our technologies 
are integral to industries that 
society relies on each and every 
day: life sciences, food and 
beverage, power and energy, just 
to name a few. We understand 
the important role we play to help 
these industries carry on their vital 
work and as we fight this global 
pandemic together, we remain 
confident that we will recover  
from this as a stronger team  
and organization. 
I want to extend my personal 
gratitude to the Emerson Board 
of Directors, management team, 
customers and employees around 
the world for their support. Amidst 
a time filled with its fair share of 
achievements and challenges, we remain more resolved than ever to 
positively impact our customers, 
employees and communities. 
Through this report and other 
communications, we are pleased 
to share our activities and progress 
with our stakeholders, and we are 
dedicated to building upon this 
progress in the years to come. 
My personal regards,
David N. Farr  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer

PROTECTING FOOD  
QUALITY AND  
ENVIRONMENTAL  
SUSTAINABILITY
Food waste is a significant global 
issue. Wasted food is the single 
largest category of material placed 
in landfills, according to the U.S. 
Food & Drug Administration. 
Emerson’s technology solutions 
help protect food across the 
cold chain – the network of 
refrigerated transport trucks, 
warehouses, retailers and 
restaurants used to maintain safe 
food temperatures and storage 
from farm to fork. These same 
Emerson technologies are used 
to protect critical, temperature-
sensitive medications. At the other 
side of food’s life cycle, Emerson 
provides advanced food waste disposer solutions to help turn 
inevitable food scraps into energy. 
Fighting Food Waste with 
Cold Chain Technology
In addition to grocery stores 
and delivery trucks, Emerson’s 
technologies help organizations 
like the Mississauga Food Bank, 
a hunger relief organization in 
Ontario, Canada, regulate food 
temperatures for those in need. 
The Mississauga Food Bank 
distributes more than 2.5 million 
pounds of food annually, with perishable food accounting for 
more than half of its inventory. 
Emerson donated a wireless 
temperature monitoring system 
to help the food bank manage and 
protect its inventory, ensuring 
the organization was able to 
serve the families throughout the 
community who need it most.
Turning Food Waste 
into Energy
Through our garbage disposal 
technologies, Emerson has 
helped divert 80 million tons  
of food waste from landfills. We 
are building on this technology 
with our Grind2Energy solution, 
which uses industrial InSinkErator 
disposers to enable businesses  
to turn food scraps into 
renewable energy.In 2019, Emerson installed this 
innovative solution in McCormick 
Place  – North America’s largest 
convention center and the first 
convention center in the world  
to receive Green Seal certification 
for environmentally responsible 
food purchasing. McCormick 
Place and SAVOR…Chicago, the 
venue’s exclusive food service 
operator, have operations in place 
to compost, recycle and donate 
leftover food, diverting nearly  
60% of food waste from landfills. 
With the installation of Grind2Energy,  
McCormick Place can now divert virtually 100%  
of preconsumer organic waste from their facility.2019 EMERSON CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT TRANSFORMING INDUSTRIES14
ENSURING HUMAN  
COMFORT AND  
HEALTH
Emerson empowers customers and 
businesses to reduce strain on the 
grid and manage energy efficiency 
through smart home technologies –  
like our smart thermostats, 
complementary heating and cooling 
solutions and energy-efficient 
compressor units – while maintaining 
optimal human comfort and health.
Maximizing Efficiency 
and Ease with 
Technology Solutions
Less than two years after 
Emerson’s Sensi smart 
thermostats received ENERGY STAR® certification, Emerson 
has been named an ENERGY 
STAR® Partner of the Year. Sensi 
is the first smart thermostat 
brand to win this honor.  
ENERGY STAR, a joint program 
between the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Energy, is a 
well-known indicator of energy 
efficiency and cost savings. 
By adjusting the temperature 
using flexible scheduling, 
remote access and geofencing, 
Sensi Smart thermostats saved 
customers about 23% on HVAC 
energy usage. These energy 
savings were calculated by 
comparing operation time for 
a nationwide sample of Sensi 
users, with savings varying due 
to a variety of factors including 
equipment type and frequency  
of temperature adjustments.
Building on its Sensi suite of 
smart home capabilities, Emerson 
created a technology solution to 
monitor performance, identify 
issues and alert contractors and homeowners to costly 
inefficiencies in HVAC units 
with Sensi Predict. In addition to 
improving energy efficiency, this 
solution also brings ease to home 
improvement contractors as they

ADVANCING  
ENERGY AND  
RESOURCE  
EFFICIENCY
Environmental sustainability 
is a critical issue for individuals 
and businesses alike, and we 
are committed to advancing 
strategies and technologies to 
lower emissions and improve 
resource efficiency throughout our 
company and with our customers. Enabling Customer 
Efficiency & Environmental 
Sustainability
Our manufacturing customers 
are prioritizing opportunities 
to enhance the environmental 
sustainability and efficiency of their 
operations while working to reach 
Top Quartile performance, within the 
top 25% of their peers, in key areas 
like improved reliability, enhanced 
safety, higher production and lower 
energy usage. But with a wide array 
of metrics in use to measure energy 
usage and material usage, it can be 
difficult to know where to start and 
how to measure progress. Emerson 
helps customers define their vision 
and design their environmental 
sustainability journey. 
By combining Emerson’s technology 
offerings, technical expertise and process knowledge, we help 
enable customers to realize their 
efficiency and environmental 
sustainability goals. Through the 
implementation of our proven 
roadmap, customers transform 
their operations and boost 
production while reducing energy, 
resource usage and emissions. 
Studies have found that Top 
Quartile performing facilities spend 
one-third as much as the industry 
average on energy costs and have 
30% less CO2 emissions.
In addition, Emerson’s  
Plantweb™ digital ecosystem –  
a scalable and secure portfolio 
of transformational sensors, 
intelligent control elements, 
software and services – provides 
industrial customers with the 
insights and confidence needed 
to drive measurable business 
improvement. Together with 
Emerson’s high-fidelity simulator, 
known as a “digital twin,” Plantweb 
enables customers to identify 
and test proposed adjustments 
to operations risk free and in real 
time, helping ensure changes 
won’t impact production. 
In the refining industry, for 
example, premature fouling 
of heat exchangers can lead to 
increased cost of operations and 
loss of overall energy efficiency 
due to increased maintenance 
needs and fuel and steam usage. 
Dynamic monitoring through 
Plantweb sensors and analytics can 
detect premature fouling and alert 
technicians when action is needed, 
before energy losses occur. With 
thousands of heat exchangers 
across some enterprises, the 
potential impact is substantial.2019 EMERSON CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT TRANSFORMING INDUSTRIES16
Emerson Sustainability & Decarbonization Manager 
Ana Gonzalez Hernandez helped develop a universal, 
integrated resource efficiency metric based on the 
thermodynamic principle of exergy. This scalable metric 
enables producers as well as policymakers to measure 
the efficiency with which raw materials and energy are 
used in the production of a given product or service.  
By broadening our view of resource efficiency, Emerson 
can provide customers with better insights on what 
they can do, more holistically, to have a tangible 
impact on their goals. When combined with advanced 
data analytics and sensor technology, this method 
will provide a comprehensive tool to measure relative 
performance and identify a wider range of opportunities 
for process optimization. Employees Making an Impact:

World Refrigeration Day is one 
way Emerson partners closely 
with the industry. This year, we 
hosted informational webinars on 
the application and regulation of 
refrigerants for others in the industry. 
As regulations evolve, Emerson 
engages with global industry 
associations, original equipment 
manufacturers and chemical 
companies to determine the best

Promoting Industrial 
Worker Safety 
We work with customers every day 
to help them confidently protect 
their facilities, personnel and 
community. By helping companies 
reach Top Quartile performance, 
we are helping them enhance their 
safety and protect their teams. 
In terms of safety, Top Quartile 
performers had two-thirds fewer 
safety incidents as compared to 
their average industry peers. 
Technology is helping make a 
safety impact. Our Location 
Awareness technology leverages 
our Plantweb infrastructure to 
allow companies to monitor 
and help protect employees in 
refineries, chemical plants and  
oil and gas platforms.In addition, our Mimic™ 
Simulation Software provides 
accurate and real-time simulation 
of plant behaviors, and was 
enhanced in 2019 with new 
modeling capabilities, usability 
enhancements and tuning 
options to help engineers 
accelerate workforce safety and 
more easily create, modify and 
integrate simulations for process 
improvements in a plant.
Our technology is helping 
companies operate in measurably 
safer ways. For example, 
Emerson’s corrosion and erosion 
sensors, gas leak detection and 
pipeline integrity technologies 
reduce personnel exposure risk 
in industrial facilities, while also 
helping to protect surrounding 
communities and the environment. 
Additionally, automated real-time data and greater process insight 
provide early notification of 
anomalies, reducing the risk  
of an event. 
While detection of potential 
safety issues is crucial, a plant’s 
Safety Instrumented System (SIS) 
serves as the ultimate safeguard, 
intelligently springing into action 
when operating conditions become 
unstable – protecting the plant, 
its people and the surrounding 
community. Emerson’s SIS, part  
of the Plantweb digital ecosystem, 
is the industry’s most advanced 
and digitally integrated plant  
safety system.
Protecting Utility and 
Electrical Workers 
This year, we also created the 
industry’s first insulated battery-powered hydraulic tool line. Our 
Greenlee Gator® Insulated Series of 
cutters and crimpers are designed 
with insulation barriers to help 
offer added protection from 
electric shock up to 1,000 volts of 
electricity, helping to save the lives 
of professional utility and electrical 
tradesmen while on the job.

LEADING  
INDUSTRIES   
INTO THE  
DIGITAL FUTURE
Digital transformation helps our 
customers use the latest advanced 
technologies to revolutionize 
business operations and  
optimize performance. 
But integration of new 
technologies is often a complex 
transition that affects not 
only existing processes and 
procedures, but also the everyday 
work of employees. Emerson is 
committed to helping customers 
navigate this transition with 
scalable technologies and 
training solutions.Improving Performance 
and Productivity
Our industrial customers 
are using the latest digital 
transformation technologies  
to reach performance in the top 
25%, or Top Quartile, of their 
peers, measured by enhanced 
safety, minimized energy usage, 
optimized production and 
improved reliability. Through our 
robust global consulting program, 
Emerson helps customers implement solutions that  
address their specific needs, 
optimize their operations and 
make the most of their – and  
the planet’s – resources.
In 2019, we deepened our 
commitment to manufacturers’ 
Top Quartile performance with 
the launch of a new Digital 
Transformation organization . 
The new business brings 
together critical resources to 
help manufacturers develop 
and implement pragmatic 
digital transformation strategies 
that deliver industry-leading 
performance, combining 
existing expertise in consulting, 
project execution, smart sensor technologies, data management 
and analytics to help customers 
not only establish a clear vision 
for digital transformation, but 
also execute with confidence and 
realize measurable results at each 
step of their journey.
Simply having data isn’t enough 
to enhance operations. Through 
our Plantweb™ digital ecosystem, 
we offer the most comprehensive 
operational analytics portfolio in 
the industry , enabling companies 
to bring industrial facilities to life 
with dynamic sensor and analytics 
networks to detect problems 
before they impact production 
or risk personnel safety. We arm 
plant workers with the real-time 
insight to proactively assess the 
integrity of operating equipment, 
and target maintenance that 
reduces risk while helping to 
ensure business continuity.2019 EMERSON CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT TRANSFORMING INDUSTRIES21
Training the Workforce 
of the Future 
We understand the importance  
of training the next generation  
of innovators to develop  
the strength of the skilled  
trades workforce. 
Emerson partners with over 350 
universities and colleges across  
the globe to provide the curriculum 
and training needed for students  
to succeed in today’s workforce.  
A few examples include:
• Our partnership with Texas  
A&M College of Engineering  
and its Emerson Advanced

GOVERNANCE
As part of our commitment to 
earning and maintaining the trust 
and confidence of our stakeholders, 
Emerson is dedicated to the 
highest standards of corporate 
governance to ensure our 
company operates responsibly. 
Board of Directors
Members of Emerson’s Board  
of Directors are elected by 
shareholders to provide oversight 
and strategic guidance to 
senior management. The core 
responsibility of the Board is to 
exercise its fiduciary duty to act 
diligently and in the best interests 
of all the company’s shareholders. 
The Board selects and oversees the members of senior management, 
to whom the Board delegates 
the authority and responsibility 
for the day-to-day operations of 
the business. The Board provides 
guidance and oversight regarding 
the management of the company 
and is responsible for establishing 
all significant company policies, 
overseeing compliance with 
those policies and approving all 
significant company transactions.Board of Directors Policies
Emerson’s principles and practices 
are driven by its Board of Directors, 
which ensures these foundational 
elements are shaped by highly 
independent, diverse viewpoints 
and deep management expertise. 
Our Board’s composition 
and operations are guided by 
Emerson’s Corporate Governance  
Principles and Practices , which 
include the following guidelines:
INDEPENDENCE 
The majority of Board members 
must remain independent, and 
this independence is confirmed 
at least annually. At the end of 
2019, Emerson’s Board included 
10 independent members and 
just one inside director, Emerson’s 
Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer David N. Farr. Our Director 
Independence Standards are 
contained in Annex II to our 
Corporate Governance Principles 
and Practices.COMPOSITION
Board members must bring senior 
management business experience 
or experience in government or 
other relevant organizations. 
We continually seek a diversity 
of viewpoints on our Board 
that helps us to understand 
and anticipate changes in our 
business environment, as well  
as ethnic and gender diversity. 
COMMITTEES
To provide sustained, specialized 
and in-depth oversight in certain 
areas, Emerson’s Board of 
Directors has five committees: 
Audit, Compensation, Corporate 
Governance and Nominating, 
Executive, and Finance. All 
committees, except for the 
Executive Committee, are 
comprised entirely of independent 
Board members. More information 
about our Board committees and 
their charters is available in the 
Corporate Governance section  
of Emerson.com.LEADERSHIP
The Board’s Lead Independent 
Director serves as the key liaison 
between the Chairman and the 
rest of the Board. The duties of the 
Lead Independent Director include 
presiding at Board meetings at 
which the Chairman is absent, 
including executive sessions of 
independent or nonmanagement 
directors, reviewing and 
consulting with the Chairman 
regarding meeting agendas 
and schedules and information 
to be sent to the Board, calling 
meetings of independent or 
nonmanagement directors, 
consulting with shareholders 
and serving on the Executive 
Committee. The company 
publishes in its annual Proxy 
Statement the manner in which 
shareholders can communicate 
with any director, including the

Recent Corporate Governance Actions
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee periodically reviews the company’s governance principles and practices in light of 
feedback from shareholders, industry trends and risks and opportunities facing the company. When the committee determines any such 
changes are necessary, it recommends the changes to the full Board to approve any required policy amendments. As a result of this review,  
the company took the following corporate governance actions:
AUDIT COMMITTEE   
FINANCIAL EXPERTS:  
In 2019, the Board determined 
that two members of the Audit 
Committee are Audit Committee 
Financial Experts under SEC rules. 
BOARD REFRESHMENT:   
In 2019 we added two new 
members to the Board,  
Martin Craighead, Chairman  
and Chief Executive Officer of  
Baker Hughes, and Mark Blinn, 
former President and Chief 
Executive Officer of Flowserve. DECLASSIFYING BOARD   
OF DIRECTORS:   
We recognize that a declassified 
Board of Directors is increasingly 
considered an important aspect  
of good corporate governance.  
In response to this trend  
and shareholder input, the 
company once again submitted  
a management proposal to  
declassify our Board of Directors. The proposal, if adopted, would 
have resulted in the annual 
election of Board members 
to one-year terms, and a fully 
declassified Board by 2023. The 
management proposal did not 
receive the required shareholder 
approval at the company’s  
Annual Meeting.
GHG REDUCTION TARGETS:  
In 2019, the company has 
announced a commitment to 
reduce GHG emissions by 20%, 
normalized to sales, by 2028.SHAREHOLDER  
RESPONSIVENESS:   
In response to shareholder 
input, in 2018 we proposed  
to amend our Restated Articles 
to allow shareholders the 
right to amend our Bylaws. 
The management proposal 
did not receive the required 
shareholder approval at the 
company’s Annual Meeting. Balanced Board Tenure

the company to deliver value 
well into the future. To further 
enhance shareholder value 
and position, in mid-2019 the 
Board initiated a comprehensive 
review of Emerson’s operational, 
capital allocation and portfolio 
initiatives. In collaboration with Enhancing 
Shareholder Value
One of the most important 
focus areas for the Board is 
guiding the organization through 
shifting economic trends, 
while continuing to invest in a leading consulting firm and 
independent legal and financial

the evaluation process. 
Risk Management 
and Oversight
The Board as a whole has 
responsibility for the oversight 
of Emerson’s risk management 
process. This process is designed 
to provide to the Board timely 
visibility into the identification, 
reporting, assessment and 
management of critical risks.  
The Audit Committee has specific 
responsibility for assisting the 
Board in risk management, 
including major financial 
risk exposures and the steps 
management has taken to 
monitor, mitigate and control 
such exposures, as well as an 
annual review of the company’s 
environmental activities,  
audits and expenditures.The Corporate Governance 
and Nominating Committee 
is responsible for assisting the 
Board in the oversight of the 
company’s conflict of interest 
policies, codes of ethics, 
ESG (environmental social 
governance), political activities 
and compliance with laws and 
regulations, including oversight  
of the company’s political  
spending activities. 
The formal annual risk assessment 
process includes surveys of all 
business unit presidents and 
interviews with all business 
leaders, corporate functional 
leaders and members of the 
Office of the Chief Executive.  
In addition, the employee 
responsible for mitigating the 
risk and the mitigation plan and 
timeline ensures relevant findings 
are documented.The full Board, or the appropriate 
committee, receives this risk 
assessment information annually 
to enable it to understand 
and monitor Emerson’s risk 
management process. Information 
brought to the attention of the 
committees is shared with the full 
Board as appropriate. Ongoing 
risk assessments in various areas 
are also conducted as part of 
Emerson’s normal management 
process, and the results of those 
assessments are shared with the 
Board or relevant committee as 
needed throughout the year.  
This could include potential  
issues such as ethics or human 
rights violations, environmental 
risks, etc.Political  
Participation
Emerson’s shareholders, 
employees and customers are 
affected by public policies at all 
levels of government. To protect 
shareholder value, Emerson 
engages with public officials to 
educate them on our company’s 
operations, emerging technologies 
and markets.

 OPERATING RESPONSIBLYINTEGRITY  
AND ETHICS
At Emerson, employees and 
leaders are expected to uphold 
high standards of honest and 
ethical behavior, to not only 
cultivate trust among one 
another, but with our customers, 
suppliers and communities. As a company, we are steadfast 
in our commitment to maintain 
ethical conduct and legal 
compliance – and clearly define 
policies and practices for 
employees through our Ethics 
and Compliance program. This 
program is overseen by the  
Corporate Governance and 
Nominating Committee of the 
Board of Directors.
Our Ethics and Compliance 
program takes a comprehensive 
approach through monitoring, 
investigation and evaluation – 
merging three core functional 
areas including Human Resources, 
Audit and Compliance, and Law. We seek to communicate our 
program as distinctly as possible 
to employees through trainings, 
documentation and reporting 
channels in which employees can 
escalate questions or concerns. 
The program is revisited annually 
to ensure consistency with the 
current business environment 
and industries in which we 
operate. New employees are 
introduced to the program during 
their onboarding, and current 
employees and leaders are 
refreshed on the program on an 
annual basis through trainings. Employee Code  
of Conduct
Our Employee Code of Conduct  
handbook, “The Right Way,” serves 
as the foundation for how Emerson 
and our employees conduct 
business around the world. The 
latest version is available to all 
employees and the public at 
Emerson.com/ethics and has 
been translated into more than 
20 languages. Supplemental 
ethical guidelines are also 
provided to executive officers 
and members of the Board of 
Directors – and available to the 
public – to address the special 
responsibilities of these leaders. 
We are committed to ethical conduct and 
legal compliance – and we clearly define our 
policies and practices for employees through 
our Ethics and Compliance Program. 2019 EMERSON CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT27

Annual Ethics Trainings
All employees are required to 
complete our company’s ethics 
training on an annual basis to 
ensure comprehension of our 
Employee Code of Conduct. The 
training is offered in person and 
online, with several interactive 
components and an evaluation  
at the end. While we prioritize  
in-person training, online  
training is also offered to ensure  
we reach our remote workforces.  
In 2019, we achieved a nearly 
100% completion rate. In this training, we cover a wide 
range of ethics and compliance 
subject areas, including 
expectations of ethical business 
practices and behavior, the latest 
updates to governance principles 
and practices, and the channels  
we offer to report ethical 
concerns. We make it a priority 
to discuss our no tolerance 
policy for sexual harassment or 
retaliation of any kind as well as 
anti-corruption information that 
reflects risks identified during  
the previous year’s audits.
In addition to the all-employee 
training, managers in the United 
States are required to complete a separate training, “You and 
the Law,” that narrows in on the 
ethical responsibilities of those  
in supervisory roles. 
Based on training evaluations 
and feedback given in our annual 
global employee engagement 
survey, we know our Ethics and 
Compliance program is engaging 
employees effectively. In the 2019 
survey, both salaried and hourly 
employees reported having a 
strong understanding of our Ethics 
and Compliance program and how 
to report an ethics concern.

reporting process, which provides 
employees with clear steps on how to report unethical behavior while 
ensuring the protection of their 
employment status. We are fully 
committed to safeguarding  
against nonretaliation or 
harassment of whistleblowers. 
Employees are provided with 
several avenues to escalate ethics 
concerns. First, employees are 
encouraged to contact their 
supervisor or business unit’s ethics 
officer. Employees can also visit 
Emerson’s Ethics Reporting website 
and file a concern or call the Ethics 
hotline number. Both channels 
provide the option for employees 
to remain anonymous. We ensure

operated by an independent 
third party, which sends reports 
directly to Emerson’s corporate 
headquarters and directly to the 
Audit Committee chair for reports 
regarding accounting, internal 
controls or auditing matters. 
Review and Resolution 
of Ethics Concerns
Reports of ethics issues are 
handled by a limited number 
of experienced and specialized 
Emerson management personnel. 
Significant ethics allegations, of 
which Emerson has a set criterion,

transparency and communication 
are expected of our employees. In 
addition to disclosing the situation 
to their supervisors, employees 
complete an annual questionnaire 
to identify potential conflicts of 
interest between the company 
and any of its directors, officers 
or employees. This questionnaire 
is provided in 22 languages, and 
more than 43,000 directors, 
officers and employees

We assess and monitor risk in 
nine key areas through a range of 
methods from self-assessments 
to on-site audits to inquiries. 
Emerson engages a third party to 
review the maturity of its ethics 
and compliance program and 
the extent to which the program 
aligns with U.S. Department of 
Justice guidelines, the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organizations of 
the Treadway Commission (COSO) 
framework and other leading 
practices. The most recent review 
concluded that the program is 
aligned with these practices.Anti-Corruption Controls
Emerson follows detailed 
processes to prevent corruption 
across our global operations. 
On a quarterly basis, all business 
units are required to certify an 
Internal Control Questionnaire 
(ICQ), which includes anti-
corruption controls. In addition, 
Emerson’s internal audit annually 
conducts anti-corruption audits 
at locations identified as a part of 
a risk assessment.
In addition, all employees who 
come in contact with customers, 
government officials, third-party 
intermediaries and suppliers

 OPERATING RESPONSIBLY
Reducing Our  
GHG Emissions 
As a manufacturing leader, we 
recognize we have a role to play 
in the global effort to manage 
energy effectively and to reduce our 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Our target was developed after 
extensive work with a leading 
environmental management 
consultancy, reviewing GHG 
reporting protocols, industry best 
practices and our current global 
operations. Due to improvements  
in the data collection and calculation 
of our facilities’ GHG footprint, the 
incorporation of the market-based 
approach for scope 2 emissions 
calculations and adjustment to 
a fiscal year from calendar year, Emerson’s FY2018 baseline  
market-based GHG emissions 
intensity metric has been adjusted 
slightly to 38.8 from the previously 
reported value of 37.
To help track against our goal, 
in 2019 we implemented the 
global use of a cutting-edge 
environmental, health and 
safety software system to track, 
manage and report our GHG 
emissions, electricity usage, 
water consumption and other 
environmental data to provide 
our facilities with the tools and 
resources they need to implement 
these energy saving measures.
In 2019, we made noticeable 
progress toward our carbon mitigation target by 
producing a GHG 
emissions intensity metric 
of approximately 36.6, 
representing a 5.8% decrease 
from the 2018 baseline value. 
We achieved this reduction 
throughout a variety of 
practices, including providing 
our facilities with tools and 
resources to implement new 
energy-saving measures 
while continuing ongoing 
environmental training 
to equip colleagues with 
knowledge on best practices 
for reducing energy waste  
and conserving energy.
In September 2019, we announced 
a new GHG reduction target:
We committed to reduce our GHG emissions by 20%, normalized to 
sales, across our global manufacturing and shared service facilities 
by the year 2028, measured by our baseline year of 2018.20% Greenhouse

 OPERATING RESPONSIBLY
Environmental Footprint 
of Our Facilities
To continue building on our 
commitment to responsible 
operations, Emerson tracks our 
impact on the environment 
in several ways, including 
measuring greenhouse gas 
emissions into the atmosphere, 
water consumption and 
energy use associated with our 
manufacturing operations. 
Emerson has voluntarily disclosed 
this data as a participant in the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 
since 2006.
Our emissions reporting  
includes all facilities within our 
operational control, including  nonmanufacturing facilities such as 
warehouses, distribution centers, 
headquarters buildings, sales 
offices and engineering centers. 
Historically, we have reported 
metrics based on the calendar year. 
This year, in order to align with 
our financial reporting and add an 
intensity-based sales metric, we 
have improved our data collection 
and calculation methodologies to 
report by fiscal year. This year, we 
have also adjusted our reporting 
to include market-based scope II 
calculations in addition to location-
based calculations we’ve shared in 
the past. Moving forward, we will 
use our fiscal year market-based 
2018 calculations as a baseline 
in order to measure and track 
year-over-year progress against the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
we set in September of 2019. 
Previously reported data based on 
calendar year calculations for GHG 
emissions, water consumption  
and energy usage can be found  
at Emerson.com/CSR .
Our greenhouse gas emissions 
and electricity calculations for 
fiscal year 2019 included 186 
manufacturing facilities and 659 
nonmanufacturing facilities. Our 
water consumption calculations  
for fiscal year 2019 included  
186 manufacturing facilities.

Designing  
Greener Buildings
Emerson designs and builds many 
of our new facilities following 
the U.S. Green Building Council’s 
Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design, or LEED, 
certified standards, incorporating 
sustainable design principles and 
local standards, technologies and 
best practices. This approach is just 
another way we seek to reduce  
the impact of our operations  
on environmental resources.
Our fluid control and 
pneumatics headquarters 
in Florham Park, New 
Jersey, was recognized 
in October 2019 by the 
New Jersey Department 
of Environmental 
Protection (NJDEP) 
for its leadership in  Environmental Stewardship . The 
LEED® Silver-certified facility was 
specifically honored for voluntary 
and proactive measures taken 
to improve the environment and 
foster sustainability, including 
reduction of water and energy 
use, management of wetlands, 
diversified arboreal investments 
and meadows development.
This year, Emerson also joined 
the Energy Star Buildings & 
Plants Partnership, an initiative 
driven by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), aimed 
at raising awareness of energy 
management practices. Through 
this partnership, Emerson will 
collaborate with the Agency and 
other companies to continue 
to share best practices on 
operational resourcefulness.

 OPERATING RESPONSIBLYEnvironmental Compliance
Emerson takes into consideration 
the environmental aspects of 
how we design, engineer and 
manufacture products, ensuring 
that materials and processes 
are safe and adhere to industry 
standards and government 
regulations, such as WEEE 
(Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment) and RoHS  
(Restriction of Hazardous 
Substances) directives.We also annually assess the 
environmental compliance of 
Emerson facilities. During this 
process, we analyze the procedures 
and performance of our facilities 
against standards set by local law  
or Emerson’s standards, whichever 
is more stringent. In addition,  
when acquiring companies,  
we assess their environmental 
policies and procedures to correct 
any issues and ensure they meet 
our standards.Emerson requires every 
manufacturing facility to receive 
a third-party environmental 
compliance audit every five  
years, in which auditors conduct 
detailed inspections of the 
facility and its environmental 
records. These audits evaluate 
environmental regulatory 
compliance, as well as the overall 
environmental management 
practices of each plant. In 
addition, the audit process also 
encourages plant environmental 
managers to look beyond basic 
compliance to explore ways to 
implement more innovative 
and productive environmental 
management practices.
Before an on-site inspection by an 
outside environmental consultant, 
each plant must complete a 
detailed questionnaire provided 
by the Corporate Environmental 
Affairs Department. Once the 
formal audit is completed and the 
outside auditor submits a written 
report, Corporate Environmental Affairs works with the business 
unit president and facility 
personnel to ensure all audit 
findings are addressed.
To ensure consistent vigilance, 
about 10% of Emerson’s third-party 
audits are surprise audits,  
in which facility managers receive, 
in most cases, only 48 hours’ notice 
of the audit team’s visit.
During years in which plants do 
not have a third-party compliance 
audit, business unit environmental 
coordinators work with plant 
management to complete a self-
assessment to ensure compliance 
with environmental regulations. 
Corporate environmental staff 
oversee this annual process.
Fines and Sanctions
Emerson facilities are routinely 
inspected by environmental 
authorities in the jurisdictions 
where we operate. It is Emerson’s 
policy to cooperate fully with environmental authorities. Most 
inspections by authorities do not 
result in monetary fines, penalties 
or citations. When environmental 
fines or penalties have been 
imposed, the costs have been 
minimal in comparison with the 
size of our operations.
In fiscal year 2019, environmental 
regulators inspected our facilities 
or were notified of incidents on 
19 different occasions worldwide 
(compared with 39 occasions 
in 2018). Of these occasions in 
2019, four (compared to two 
in 2018) resulted in monetary 
penalties, which totaled 
$2,246.18. The average annual 
cost of environmental fines and 
penalties incurred globally by 
Emerson from 2014 through 2019 
was approximately $8,600.
Environmental Training
To help drive continued leadership across the organization, Emerson 
regularly conducts environmental training programs for our plant 
environmental managers, business unit environmental coordinators 
and other key personnel worldwide.
Each session addresses the specific needs of the regions in which  
our facilities are located. Employees receive online or face-to-face  
environmental training to both give employees a practical 
understanding of the environmental laws and regulations as they 
apply to the company, and share best practices on how to reduce 
waste, enhance the quality of the environment and conserve energy.

any form of harsh or inhumane 
treatment, including sexual 
harassment, sexual abuse, corporal 
punishment, mental or physical 
coercion or verbal abuse, nor do 
we allow managers to threaten 
treatment of this nature.
PROHIBITION ON FORCED LABOR 
Our policies prohibit, and we 
do not use any forced, bonded, 
indentured or other compulsory 
labor. We also prohibit our 
suppliers from using any forced, 
bonded, indentured or other 
compulsory labor. Our policies 
are in compliance with important 
regulations, like the UK Modern 
Slavery Act 2015. Emerson fully supports these and other efforts 
to eradicate human trafficking 
across the globe.
PROHIBITION OF CHILD LABOR 
Our policies oppose child labor, 
and we do not use child labor 
in any facility or business. 
Emerson has established age 
18 as a standard minimum 
age for employment, which 
complies with or exceeds local 
legal requirements. We support 
the use of legitimate workplace 
apprenticeship programs 
that conform with laws and 
regulations. We also prohibit our 
suppliers from employing anyone 
under the local legal working age.
Grievance Reporting 
Mechanisms
We prioritize providing a safe 
space where employees feel 
comfortable sharing concerns, 
either directly or through 
anonymous channels. Employee 
knowledge of where and how to file concerns routinely scores 
among the highest questions on 
our employee opinion survey. 
In addition to formal and 
informal complaint or grievance 
procedures at our business units, 
employees or other concerned 
parties have access to Emerson’s 
global ethics and compliance 
hotline to report complaints 
or concerns. Ethics hotline 
emails or calls are received by 
an independent company, 
which reports the information 
to designated management 
personnel at Emerson’s corporate 
headquarters for investigation 
and response. This outside  
service does not track visitors  
to its website, and the person  
can choose to provide their  
name or remain anonymous, 
unless prohibited by country  
regulations. Further information

Performing and Developing at 
Emerson is a two-day immersion 
workshop, training employees  
on performance reviews, setting 
career goals and outlining 
expectations of working at Emerson. 
New managers also attend our 
three-day Leading at Emerson 
workshop. This training helps 
our new managers gain a deeper 
understanding of our culture,  
hone their leadership skills and topics ranging from emotional 
intelligence to long-term  
strategic direction. 
Performance Reviews
All of our salaried employees and 
their supervisors conduct an annual 
performance review, focusing on 
performance goals, development 
goals and competency-based goals. 
Our hourly workers are also expected 
to have similar conversations, 
reviewing their performance as it 
relates to their job categories.
In 2019, we launched our new 
performance management 
process, using a global competency 
framework for employee 
performance and development 
planning. Throughout the year of 
deploying this global performance 
management system, we also 
developed a global training and

SAFETY
Safety is critical to everything we 
do, which is why Safety & Quality 
are core values for Emerson. 
Our safety efforts are guided by 
our Corporate Safety Council, 
which is composed of our top 
human resources, operations and 
safety leads for our company. The 
council meets quarterly to track 
progress on priorities, including 
safety education, prevention, 
trends and compliance. 
Each of our locations with 50 or 
more employees has a health 
and safety committee operating 
at the local level, which includes 
representation from members of the workforce, to work 
proactively in addressing health 
and safety concerns. We conduct 
safety training for all operational 
employees and management. 
We annually recognize the 
achievements of locations in 
safety performance with Safety 
Leadership Awards, including our 
Chief Operating Officer Safety 
Award given to the location with 
outstanding safety performance 
and culture programs.

We continually look for 
opportunities to engineer 
and apply protective 
devices or automation 
that can mitigate risk from 
workplace processes and 
equipment. In 2019, we 
created our Greenlee Gator  
Insulated Tools , a first-of-
its-kind insulated hydraulic 
tool line, designed to 
absorb voltage from the 
tool before it reaches the 
person using it.
ERGONOMICS
Where processes involve 
repetitive tasks, we design

minimize the impact on 
our employees. We have 
a dedicated Ergonomics 
testing lab through our

reviews equipment to 
keep it in top operating

We believe mentorship can be a 
multiplier in our work to improve 
our pipeline of diverse talent. We 
understand the importance of 
mentoring and know employees 
respond positively when an 
experienced or more senior 
colleague takes an interest in 
their professional development 
and interests. Formal mentoring 
programs are available in many 
of our business units around 
the world, and in 2019, we laid 
the groundwork to develop an 
organization-wide mentorship 
program focused on identifying 
women and minority employees who are rising 
leaders and 
matching 
them with 
knowledgeable 
mentors. 
This program 
seeks to expand 
the leadership 
competencies of  
high-potential employees 
and cultivate inclusion 
throughout Emerson.Ensuring Diversity in Our Talent Pipeline
We are urging our managers to widen the funnel of candidates we 
consider for salaried job openings and promotions to ensure the 
candidate pools being considered reflect diversity. We have also 
increased our focus on partnering our ERGs with the Talent Acquisition 
function to align diverse candidate recruiting strategies, which has led 
to a new partnership between Blacks Reinforcing Diversity and National 
Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). In addition, we engage in targeted 
recruiting in the following areas:
WOMEN: Our recruitment of engineering degree graduates and 
Master of Business Administration degree recipients puts a special focus 
on reaching women candidates. In addition to our university-focused 
recruiting, Emerson is a proud supporter of the Society of Women 
Engineers (SWE), the leading organization dedicated to the advancement 
of women engineers – and we recruit women engineering talent at SWE 
conferences and job fairs. 
MINORITIES: Emerson participates in recruiting events at universities 
and job fairs during professional societies’ annual conferences to 
identify qualified minority candidates for both entry- and executive-level 
positions. We are a longtime corporate supporter of the Consortium for 
Graduate Study in Management, which works with companies seeking to 
reduce underrepresentation of African Americans, Native Americans and 
Hispanic Americans in education and business. 
U.S. MILITARY VETERANS: Emerson and our business units seek  
to provide post-military job opportunities for U.S. military veterans.  
In addition, we regularly participate in veterans-focused MBA recruiting 
events at the University of Michigan, Northwestern University, Harvard 
University and Washington University in St. Louis.

their unconscious biases. We have

In November 2019, Emerson’s Rosemount Tank Radar site in Sweden hosted its first Diversity & Inclusion Week,

assessment tool that helps 
build cultural understanding, 
shift perspectives on diversity 
issues and appropriately adapt 
behavior to cultural differences

 STRENGTHENING COMMUNITIESSTEM   
EDUCATION
Emerson is playing a lead role in 
our local communities and globally 
to help prepare our future leaders 
with STEM-related education 
and raise awareness of career 
opportunities in these fields.
For five years, we have conducted 
a STEM survey to understand 
more about perceptions and 
beliefs about STEM education and 
careers. Our 2019 survey – our  
first global survey – found that 
60% of Americans are interested in 
pursuing STEM careers, but only 
39% feel encouraged to do so.
As the global manufacturing 
industry relies more and more on 
STEM skills – and its workforce is required to have more technical 
knowledge than ever before –  
Emerson is committed to bridging 
this gap. To prepare the next 
generation for these careers, 
Emerson has an enhanced 
emphasis on promoting STEM, 
especially among women 
and minorities who are 
traditionally underrepresented 
in the engineering and 
manufacturing industries.From Gen X to Gen Z,

 STRENGTHENING COMMUNITIES
The goal of the “We Love STEM” initiative is to 
help young people discover STEM fields – and 
some students even leave our events inspired  
to pursue careers in STEM.
We Love STEM
Launched in 2015, our “We Love 
STEM” campaign continued in 
2019 to increase support for 
STEM education and awareness 
of career opportunities. Our 
ongoing partnership with 
YouTube star and STEM advocate 
Hank Green in 2019 led to a 
series of videos on STEM topics 
from the importance of female  
role models in STEM to the ways  
engineers move medicine around 
the world. Emerson shares 
these videos on our social media 
channels and dedicated “We Love 
STEM” hub to extend our reach, are organized with volunteer 
support from our employees, 
most especially our local Women 
in STEM members. Emerson has 
hosted 23 “We Love STEM” events

 UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
Established by the United Nations  
and adopted by member states in 
2015, the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) identify the ways  
in which organizations and  
individuals can make our world  
more sustainable, prosperous 
and resilient for the future. UN SUSTAINABLE  
DEVELOPMENT  
GOALS
In 2019, we began to assess how 
we can best contribute to the 
SDGs. Through a preliminary 
approach, we have identified 
several initiatives and practices  
in place that aim to address the 
various environmental, social and economic challenges  
facing our planet today. 
Examples of these actions  
and programs as they relate  
to the SDGs are illustrated 
here and throughout  
this report.GOAL 4 –   
QUALITY EDUCATION
As the global manufacturing 
industry relies on STEM skills, 
Emerson is uncompromising in 
our efforts to bridge the current 
skills-gap. We are working to 
ensure equitable access to all 
levels of education, especially 
for those who are traditionally 
underrepresented in the 
engineering and manufacturing 
industries. In fiscal 2019, Emerson 
pledged $3 million in funding 
commitments in support of  
STEM education, programs  
and activities. GOAL 6 – CLEAN WATER   
AND SANITATION
Through our fluid control products 
and solutions, Emerson is working 
to improve water quality and 
increase access to safe drinking 
water by helping our customers 
ensure their water applications 
are clean, safe and compliant with 
regulations. In 2019, Emerson 
expanded our lead-free ASCO™ 
valve offerings to enable original 
equipment manufacturers and 
contractors to comply with U.S. Safe 
Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Section 
1417. The expansion eliminates the 
necessity for complex lead content 
calculations and simplifies the 
replacement of existing valves  
with lead-free brass models.GOAL 5 –   
GENDER EQUALITY
Emerson is making a concerted 
effort across the company and 
around the world to advance 
women’s participation in the 
workforce and end gender-
based discrimination. In 
2019, we laid the foundation 
for an organization-wide 
mentorship program focused on 
identifying women and minority 
employees who are rising 
leaders and matching them with 
knowledgeable mentors. The 
program seeks to expand the 
leadership competencies of  
high-potential employees and 
cultivate inclusion throughout 
Emerson and beyond.

GOAL 7 – AFFORDABLE   
AND CLEAN ENERGY
From smart sensors in industrial 
facilities to cloud applications and 
connected services, Emerson is 
helping customers across industries 
introduce technologies to improve 
energy efficiency. In advance 
of evolving regulations facing 
customers in the commercial air 
conditioning industry, Emerson 
recently introduced a new line of 
Copeland™ scroll compressors 
specifically designed for lower-
GWP refrigerants and increased 
energy efficiencies. The flexible 
product platform also provides 
infrastructure upon which future 
sustainability improvements 
can be expanded – all without 
compromising ease of system 
installation or servicing.GOAL 9 – INDUSTRY,  
INNOVATION AND  
INFRASTRUCTURE
Emerson’s Plantweb and Ovation 
systems allow industrial customers 
in countries such as China, India, 
Poland and others to modernize 
their power plants to operate 
more efficiently and enable other 
power generators to adapt to 
cleaner energy sources. In 2019, 
Emerson began work with TransAlta 
Corporation to help convert 
coal-fired plants to natural gas 
for delivery of clean, sustainable 
and affordable electricity. The 
conversions will substantially reduce 
emissions while providing clean, 
reliable electricity to the  
city of Alberta.North America’s largest convention 
center. With the installation of 
Grind2Energy, McCormick Place 
can now divert virtually 100% of 
pre-consumer organic waste from 
their facility. This focus extends to 
many resources. Emerson’s flow 
measurements solutions are essential 
to improving resource efficiency  
for industrial customers, providing 
real-time measurements to allow 
them to manage and optimize 
materials use, energy efficiency  
and emissions performance.GOAL 17 – PARTNERSHIPS   
FOR THE GOALS
No one organization or policy 
solution on its own can address the 
challenges we face in advancing 
these ambitious goals. Emerson 
actively participates in a number  
of strategic public -private 
partnerships and coalitions 
dedicated to promoting the 
development and dissemination 
of technology solutions for all, 
including the CEO Action for 
Diversity & Inclusion, the European 
Partnership for Energy and the 
Environment, the Global Food Cold 
Chain Council, the Responsible 
Minerals Initiative, and the ENERGY 
STAR® buildings and Plants 
Partnership, to name a few.GOAL 8 – DECENT WORK   
AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
Through our regionalized  
sourcing strategy, Emerson 
has made significant long-term 
investments to serve local market 
suppliers and support sustainable 
economic development in the 
areas where we operate. With this 
in-region, for-region focus, we 
have helped to advance critical 
infrastructure around the world  
and provide enhanced training, 
research and upskilling 
opportunities for local talent. 
GOAL 12 – RESPONSIBLE  
CONSUMPTION AND  
PRODUCTION
Around the globe, Emerson is working 
to ensure we and our customers 
responsibly make the most of the 
planet’s resources. Through our 
garbage disposal technologies, 
we’ve helped divert 80 million tons 
of food waste from landfills. We’re 
building on this technology with our 
Grind2Energy solution, which uses 
industrial InSinkErator disposers to 
enable businesses to turn food scraps 
into renewable energy. In 2019, 
Emerson installed the innovative 
solution into McCormick Place –

Emerson uses an in-house methodology for collecting activity data. Each year, a form is sent out to 
environmental staff at each manufacturing facility requesting the following information: stationary 
combustion use, fuel types, amount of fuel purchased/used, mobile combustion fuel type and amount 
purchased/used, vehicle types and amount of fuel used for each, amount of electricity used, cost of 
electricity used, how electricity is generated, and any reason for change in emissions from the previous 
year. These data are compiled and used to calculate Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 1 emissions are 
calculated using the EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance –  
direct emission from mobile and stationary sources, January 2016, tables A-1, A-2, B-1, B-7 and B-8. For 
CY2018 Emerson included nonmanufacturing sites in the Scope 1 and 2 emissions. While estimations
