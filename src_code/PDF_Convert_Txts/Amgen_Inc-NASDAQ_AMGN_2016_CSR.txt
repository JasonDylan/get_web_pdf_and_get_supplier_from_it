Innovation is fostered by different perspectives, experiences and 
backgrounds. The diversity of our patients is reflected in our staff. We 
continually strive to create an inclusive workplace that values diversity. 
Our mission is supported by our commitment to conducting business 
ethically, in compliance with the laws and regulations that govern 
our business and industry. We recognize that our suppliers also play 
an important role in our ability to serve patients. We launched an 
enhanced Supplier Code of Conduct in 2016 to expressly communicate 
our expectation that our suppliers adhere to the same high standards

responsible manner. We have a 2020 Environmental Sustainability Plan 
in place, which is enabling us to reduce the environmental impact of 
our operations. Through this commitment, we have demonstrated that 
sustainable operations improve efficiency and create value for our 
business. We are making steady progress toward achieving our 2020 
targets to reduce carbon emissions, water usage and waste.
We are also proud to continue to receive external recognition of our 
progress. Amgen earned placement on the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Indices (DJSI) World Index for the third consecutive year and on the

Amgen 2016 Responsibility Highlights Report    5COMMITMENT
Amgen is dedicated to making a positive difference 
in the world. This conviction extends beyond making 
vital medicines to address unmet medical needs. 
We are committed to corporate responsibility, from 
our mission to serve patients to all aspects of how 
we operate to the significant resources we dedicate 
toward building a better tomorrow in the communities 
where we operate.
Responsibility Governance
Amgen’s social and environmental responsibility 
performance is governed through facility- and 
corporate-level management reviews. One key 
component of Amgen’s corporate-level governance 
is the Sustainability Council. The Council, which 
includes representation by leaders from a wide 
cross-section of company functions, provides 
guidance on the implementation of our environmental 
sustainability plan and areas of social responsibility. 
In addition, our executive leadership reports our 
progress in certain of these areas to the Corporate 
Responsibility and Compliance Committee (CRCC) 
of our Board of Directors. The CRCC assists the 
Board in overseeing Amgen’s activities in the areas of 
corporate responsibility and compliance. 
For more information on Amgen’s corporate 
governance and the Board of Directors, visit the 
Leadership  section of www.amgen.com.Engaging With Stakeholders
We strive to accommodate a variety of stakeholder 
needs for information on our environmental and 
social responsibility performance. Those stakeholders 
include those who use our products, those from the 
financial sector and those who are interested in how 
our business impacts the environment and society, 
such as community and industry group members 
and our staff. 
Amgen participates in a number of annual surveys, 
responding with detailed information requested by 
stakeholders, such as the CDP (formerly known 
as Carbon Disclosure Project) and the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Indices (DJSI) in collaboration with 
RobecoSAM. As evidence of our ability to respond to 
issues of greatest concern to stakeholders, in 2016, 
Amgen was selected as a member of the DJSI North 
America Index for a fourth year in a row and for the 
highly selective World Index for a third year in a row.
As an example of the kind of stakeholder engagement 
that brings greater depth to our mission to serve 
patients and our role as a responsible company, in 
2016, Amgen continued its high-level engagement 
with patient advocacy organizations. This engagement 
includes our partnership with nonprofits through the 
Breakaway from Cancer and Breakaway from Heart 
Disease  initiatives.In order to ensure that our responsibility-related 
strategies and communications remain relevant 
and aligned with internal and external stakeholder 
expectations, in 2016, we initiated a process 
to update our assessment of key stakeholder 
perspectives. In 2017, we will be engaging with 
those stakeholders to gather updated perspectives 
to facilitate continuous improvement of our 
responsibility strategies and communications.

The Amgen Foundation
The Amgen Foundation  seeks to advance excellence 
in science education to inspire the next generation of 
innovators and invest in strengthening communities 
where Amgen staff members live and work.
Ten years ago, we announced our commitment to 
educating the next generation of scientists through 
the Amgen Scholars Program (ASP). ASP provides 
undergraduates with the opportunity to engage in 
cutting-edge research experiences at world-leading 
institutions and learn about biotechnology. In 
2016, we celebrated this milestone by unveiling the 
Amgen Scholars Ten to Watch,  which highlights 
the best and brightest up-and-comers in science 
and medicine selected from more than 3,000 Amgen 
Scholars alumni.The Amgen Foundation continued its partnership 
with Khan Academy in 2016, providing a new three-
year, $3 million grant to develop comprehensive 
biology content and becoming Khan Academy’s 
Science Partner. Khan Academy is a leading, 
innovative and effective educational technology 
platform—with 53 million registered users across 
the globe—with demonstrated power to shape 
and transform how we learn, including in science. 
Previously, the Amgen Foundation provided Khan 
Academy with a $700,000 grant and oversight to 
develop a series of videos, articles and quizzes for 
students taking biology courses at the Advanced 
Placement through introductory college levels. 
That partnership resulted in the creation of more 
than 450 new biology content items.  
The Amgen Biotech Experience (ABE)  engaged
nearly 80,000 high school students with a hands-on
lab experience in 2016, reaching more than 
500,000 students to date. Over 800 teachers bring 
biotechnology to their classrooms each year through 
this hands-on molecular biology curriculum that 
introduces students to the excitement of scientific 
discovery. The Foundation’s support for ABE has 
surpassed $14 million.

Amgen 2016 Responsibility Highlights Report    7As part of the Amgen Foundation’s ongoing 
commitment to improving science education, in 2016, 
more than 1,000 educators across 10 European 
countries participating in Amgen Teach  doubled 
their use of Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE). 
In fact, teachers who said they have a high level of 
IBSE understanding rose from 1 in 3 to 4 in 5 after 
participating in the program. Amgen Teach is a 
European program funded by the Amgen Foundation 
with direction and technical assistance provided by 
European Schoolnet.
Also, in 2016, Amgen Foundation funding supported 
the development of a free, online course, “Making 
Biologic Medicines for Patients: The Principles 
of Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing,”  through 
MIT’s edX platform. More than 15,000 students aged

Commitment to Our Communities 
Amgen recognizes the importance of giving back 
to our local communities. Each year, thousands of 
Amgen staff generously devote their personal time, 
energy, talents and funds to a variety of charitable 
organizations nationwide. Amgen encourages staff to 
become involved in their local communities through 
Amgen Volunteers, our Matching Gift Program and 
company-sponsored volunteering.
The Amgen Volunteers program helps staff members 
find local volunteer opportunities, earn volunteer 
grants for their charitable organizations of choice 
and utilize paid time off for volunteering. In 2016, 
we launched Amgen Impact Day to support staff 
volunteering efforts. All full- and part-time regular, 
active staff members are eligible to take up to eight 
hours of volunteer paid time off per calendar year 
to support the effort of their choice.Amgen’s Matching Gift Program, established in 1993, 
provides a 1:1 match for staff donations to eligible 
nonprofit organizations from $50 up to $20,000 annually 
per staff member. Amgen employees can also donate 
publicly traded stock for the matching program.
In addition to supporting individual staff efforts, 
Amgen sponsors company-wide and department 
team-building volunteering opportunities. For example, 
Amgen staff from numerous Amgen locations organize 
volunteer parties to hit their local beaches for the annual 
International Coastal Cleanup. Staff clear hundreds 
of pounds of trash from beaches and waterways and 
document the type and weight of the trash they clear 
and report the data to the Ocean Conservancy, the 
worldwide sponsor of this important event.

Amgen 2016 Responsibility Highlights Report    9PATIENTS
At Amgen, our mission to serve patients is evident in 
our unwavering commitment  to deliver breakthrough 
treatments for unmet medical needs. 
We are focused on connecting patients to health 
innovation in a variety of ways. We invest billions of 
dollars annually in research and development in our 
search for therapies. We are part of the effort to 
develop more affordable therapeutic choices in the 
form of high-quality and reliably supplied biosimilars. 
We price our medicines to reflect the value they 
provide for patients, payers and society. We work 
with policymakers, patients and other stakeholders 
to establish a sustainable healthcare system.  
Access to Medicine  
Amgen’s medicines make a difference for those facing 
serious illnesses, and we believe patients should 
have access to them regardless of their ability to pay. 
In addition, when appropriate, we provide access 
to our investigational medicines. Through Amgen’s 
charitable patient assistance program, Amgen Safety 
Net Foundation, Amgen supports qualifying patients 
in the United States who might go without important 
medicines because of financial barriers. This program 
provides medicines to patients experiencing financial 
difficulty at no cost. Patient Safety  
Patient safety is of utmost importance to Amgen. 
We are committed to compliance with the applicable 
worldwide regulations regarding collection and review 
of information regarding adverse events, product 
complaints and other safety findings experienced 
by patients and clinical trial subjects taking our 
approved or investigational products. This information 
helps us better understand drug safety profiles and 
deliver safer products to patients.
Amgen gathers and analyzes safety data throughout 
a product’s lifecycle. Product safety is rigorously 
evaluated during the development process through 
clinical trials. Once a product is approved, safety 
data collection continues through multiple pathways, 
including additional clinical studies, reports by 
patients and healthcare professionals, registries, 
scientific literature and database reviews. 
For more information, see Global Patient Safety  in 
Products on www.amgen.com.Donations for Health Education and Promotion
Every year, Amgen donates millions of dollars to 
organizations that advance medicine and healthcare, 
promote healthcare professional education, educate 
the public on diseases and medical conditions and 
support other philanthropic and charitable causes 
that ultimately benefit patients. Amgen’s corporate 
giving initiatives are very diverse: research grants and 
fellowships; medical education grants; donations of 
cash, product and equipment; community involvement 
through corporate sponsorships; and cash donations 
and volunteerism by Amgen staff members. 
As part of Amgen’s mission to further the advancement 
of medicine and healthcare, Amgen supports 
Independent Medical Education (“IME”). IME is 
professional education given by accredited medical 
education providers who design and implement 
programs totally independent of any Amgen influence, 
as defined by standards such as the Accreditation 
Council for Continuing Medical Education (“ACCME”) 
guidelines, the FDA’s Guidance: Industry-Supported 
Scientific and Educational Activities and the 
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers 
Association (PhRMA) Code.

ENVIRONMENT
Environmental Sustainability at Amgen
At Amgen, we take action to mitigate and reduce our 
impact on the environment in multiple areas of our 
global business. We have proven that environmental 
sustainability is a wise investment, improving 
efficiency and creating value while supporting a 
healthy environment.Our Targets
We established these 2020 targets from our 2012 
baseline performance. We created a portfolio of 
projects and initiatives to achieve the targeted 
reduction by 2020. We track the results of those 
projects and initiatives as progress toward the 
reduction targets, counting results where reduction 
is confirmed through a formal measurement and 
verification process.
Environmental Sustainability in Action
Amgen scientists have pioneered a new 
biomanufacturing paradigm that is leaner, greener, 
more flexible and productive and less costly to build 
and operate. At one-sixth the size of a conventional 
biologics manufacturing facility, this smaller plant 
also means a reduced impact on the environment. 
Compared to a large conventional facility, a next-
generation biomanufacturing plant cuts carbon 
emissions and uses less energy and water.Progress Through 2016 2020 Target

Reducing Carbon Through Energy Conservation
Amgen implements a comprehensive carbon reduction 
strategy that focuses on eliminating energy use, increasing 
energy efficiency and increasing the proportion of energy 
used from renewable and alternative sources. We complete 
energy-related projects that provide substantial returns 
for both energy savings and carbon reduction across our 
network of facilities around the world. We have realized 
savings of $24 million in operating costs annually and 
reduced carbon emissions by 104,200 metric tons (MT), 
or 25 percent, from 2007 through 2016 by implementing 
energy conservation and carbon reduction projects.We are making progress toward our sales fleet carbon 
reduction target by raising the minimum fuel efficiency 
standard for vehicles year by year.
Some of the actions we’ve taken to reduce energy and 
carbon include:
•  Optimizing heating, ventilation and air conditioning 
in clean rooms at two U.S. manufacturing facilities to 
reduce energy consumption by 27,100 gigajoules (GJ) 
and carbon emissions by 3,200 MT.
•  Upgrading lighting systems to LED technology; reducing 
energy consumption by 7,000 GJ and carbon emissions 
by 570 MT.

Waste Performance
Total waste generation company-wide in 2016 increased 
from 2015. In 2016, we added waste generation from our 
new manufacturing facility in Singapore. This addition was 
partially offset by two facility closures completed in late 
2015 and specific waste reduction and recycling projects. 
Waste reduction projects implemented in 2016 resulted 
in an additional 162 metric tons (MT) of annual waste 
reduction to achieve a total of 850 MT since establishing 
our 2020 Targets  in 2013. We have reduced waste 
generation through projects eliminating 1,944 MT, or 
19 percent, since 2007.Reducing Waste
We diligently seek to reduce waste and increase recycling 
to reduce our environmental footprint. Despite our efforts, 
total waste generation company-wide in 2016 increased 
from 2015. Some of the waste reduction practices and 
projects we implement to drive waste reduction and 
recycling deeper into our business include:
•  Recycling plastics used in manufacturing  
where possible.
•  Composting of food waste, paper towels and 
landscaping waste where available.
• Efficient chemical management.

that govern our business and industry. Amgen’s 
leadership, including its Board of Directors, is 
committed to promoting an ethical culture. 
Amgen’s Board of Directors, CEO and senior financial 
officers and staff are guided by Business Conduct 
Standards. As a company, we have developed 
rigorous Codes of Conduct, Policies, Committees 
and Charters to guide us in responsible operations, 
which collectively we view as our tools to ensure that 
we “Do the Right Thing.”
In addition to the Staff Code of Conduct, we have 
a number of resources available for staff members 
in particular to help them “Do the Right Thing,” including compliance websites and training courses; 
Amgen’s compliance policies; guidance from 
managers and dedicated compliance professionals; 
and Amgen’s Business Conduct Hotline. 
Fighting serious illness takes more than pioneering 
science and vital medicines; it also requires 
collaborating with people and organizations around 
the world who advance science and provide quality 
healthcare for patients. These relationships are built 
upon ethical and responsible business conduct and 
reliable disclosure of information and are conducted 
with guidance from a number of Policies, Practices 
and Disclosures  as published on Amgen.com.
Business Ethics and the Amgen Values
Amgen’s Worldwide Compliance & Business Ethics 
Program is grounded in the Amgen Values. Our 
values form a deeply held belief system that guides 
our behavior, helps us make the right decisions and 
builds the framework for our daily interactions with 
each other. We value people, integrity and results. 
This combination is essential in accomplishing our 
mission, which is to serve patients.

Supplier Sustainability 
Amgen’s extensive global network of suppliers is vital 
to our ability to provide high-quality medicines to 
patients reliably and efficiently. We have developed a 
Supplier Sustainability Program designed to support 
our expectation that our suppliers not only address 
quality, cost and reliability requirements but also a 
wide range of sustainability and social responsibility 
considerations, such as business ethics, labor and 
human rights and environmental impacts.
In 2016, considerable progress was made in 
advancing Amgen’s Supplier Sustainability 
Program. Amgen issued an enhanced Supplier 
Code of Conduct  that addresses a wide range of 
environmental sustainability and social responsibility 
performance expectations. In addition, we initiated 
a Supplier Sustainability Assessment to evaluate 
the performance of our key suppliers against the 
requirements of our Supplier Code of Conduct. 
Addressing Conflict Minerals 
Amgen is also addressing a number of specific issues 
associated with its supply chain. In the area of conflict 
minerals, Amgen will seek to identify, reduce and 
ultimately eliminate the use in its products of conflict 
minerals that directly or indirectly finance armed 
groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  and surrounding countries. In addition, Amgen has 
issued public statements with regards to its efforts  
to address concerns about modern slavery in its 
supply chain.

(a) The adjustments related primarily to non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. 2007 also included the non-cash expense associated with writing off the acquired in-process R&D.
(b) The adjustments related primarily to asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and other charges related to the closure of our facilities, as well as severance. 2015 also included gains recognized on the sale of assets related to our site closures.
(c) The adjustments related to the recognition of an additional year of the non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee, as required by final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service.
(d) The adjustment related primarily to changing regulatory and reimbursement environments.
(e) The adjustment related to the write-off of the cost of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that was not used due to a change in manufacturing strategy.
(f)  The tax effect of the adjustments between our GAAP and non-GAAP results takes into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments,  
including the majority of amortization of intangible assets, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. 
(g) The adjustments related to certain prior period items excluded from non-GAAP earnings, as well as resolving certain non-routine transfer-pricing and acquisition-related issues with tax authorities, as applicable.REPORTINGOPERATING RESPONSIBLY ENVIRONMENT REPORTING WORKPLACE PATIENTS COMMUNITY COMMITMENT

Forward-Looking Statements 
This communication contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed 
forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer 
and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below 
and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. 
Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this communication and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of 
new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products 
domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties 
or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-
party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed 
care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or 
others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In 
addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and 
the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may 
be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities 
at a few key facilities and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In 
addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates cannot be 
guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw 
materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with 
us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business 
and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. We may not be able to access the capital and credit 
markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data security. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of 
events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.REPORTINGAmgen Inc.
