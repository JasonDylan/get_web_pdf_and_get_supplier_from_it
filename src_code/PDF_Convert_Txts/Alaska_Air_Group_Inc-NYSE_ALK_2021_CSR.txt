While we appreciate this chance to show our progress, this 
report is also about holding ourselves accountable to our 
audacious goals, managing our performance, embedding 
this work into our culture and continuing to learn. When 
we’ve faced our biggest challenges in our past, those are the 
moments we made our most innovative leaps forward. 
This month we are celebrating our 90th anniversary at 
Alaska Airlines. If you look back at all of the airlines and other 
ideas that have come and gone since the 1930s, it puts this 
remarkable achievement in perspective.  
We have always taken a balanced, long-term approach to 
running our business, and that’s why we are here today, ready 
to deliver for the next generation of people who depend on us.
Being 90 doesn’t mean we’re outdated. We made it this far 
by continually reinventing ourselves and staying relevant, just 
like the pioneering innovators and visionaries who helped us 
get off the ground in the first place. Living and flying in some 
of the harshest conditions on the planet, they were driven by 
a sense of taking care of people and a deep respect of the 
landscape around them.  Those qualities are part of our DNA at Alaska Airlines and 
Horizon Air, along with core values such as “Own Safety”  
and “Do the Right Thing.” That’s not just our history—that’s 
the key to our bright future.  
We set aggressive goals and hold ourselves accountable to 
them, and we’re different than most companies by tying our 
progress to our pay. Beginning in 2021, we included a carbon 
intensity metric in the goals-based program that guides bonus 
pay for all employees. Also starting in 2021, a portion of 
long-term executive compensation depends on progress in 
diversifying our leadership ranks. 
I hope this report gives you a sense of what matters to us. 
While we no doubt have challenges we need to work through, 
I have confidence we are on the right path and we will get 
there. Here’s to a strong and vibrant future for all of us, for  
the next 90 years and beyond. Thank you for being part of 
our journey. 
Sincerely,
Ben Minicucci

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

2021 was a year of care in action. 
Last year, our sustainability report marked a significant 
milestone: we turned from reporting performance on our 
2020 goals to setting the course for 2025 and beyond, with 
goals across environmental, social impact and governance 
and getting to net zero carbon emissions by 2040. 
In the year since, we’ve been on the journey. We’ve made 
progress, learned new things, celebrated milestones, adapted 
and expanded our reach. Here are some highlights:  
CONTROLLING WHAT WE CAN CONTROL   
A familiar mantra at Alaska is to “control what we can control.” 
That’s why the foundation of our path to net zero begins 
with operational efficiency, and why our diversity, equity and 
inclusion goals start with representation and inclusion on our 
own team. We also work to create outsized impact beyond 
our operations through partnerships and collaborations, but it 
starts with us. 
This year, we integrated green practices into our flight 
operations manual and training, and dug into what it takes 
to ensure electric ground power and air are utilized at every 
possible opportunity to mitigate the need for fuel-burning 
power when our planes are at the gate. We moved away from 
plastic water bottles and cups to recyclable Boxed Water and 
paper cups—eliminating 1.8M pounds of plastic per year.  We also updated our recruiting and talent development 
practices to better source and develop diverse talent, 
including a more diverse recruiting team. 
In 2021, we held ourselves accountable in new ways. A portion 
of all employees’ performance-based pay is tied to the carbon 
intensity of our business, and a portion of long-term executive 
compensation is tied to diverse representation in leadership. 
These levers embed stewardship for our impact in our culture 
of care. This is also our first year sharing more information 
about our climate governance and risks in a TCFD Index. 
BUILDING THE PATH TO NET ZERO  
The biggest environmental challenge for every airline is 
the climate impact of carbon emissions from burning fuel. 
Last year, we committed to reducing those emissions by 
replacing the fuel we use with sustainable alternatives, and 
to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040.  
There are some things we can do now—like ensuring the 
amount of fuel we’re burning is the minimum needed. 
That’s why we set a goal to be the most fuel-efficient U.S. 
airline. Our efficiency-minded dispatchers now have access 
to innovative Flyways software , giving them additional 
information to plan safe, efficient routes—and factor in how 
the routes work together—to save time, fuel and emissions. 
We’ve also set the course to evolve our ground fleet to more 
electric and low-emission alternatives.ALASKA AIRLINES IS IN THE BUSINESS OF CARE

But much of what’s needed to decarbonize aviation requires 
new technologies that don’t exist yet—or aren’t available 
with enough supply and at a sustainable cost. Last year, we 
focused on two areas to address that gap. 
First is a continued effort to source, support and develop 
the market for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). In 2021, we 
continued to offtake SAF at San Francisco International 
Airport, but it made up less than 1% of our total fuel. To 
address the challenge of scalability, Alaska continued along 
two paths: 
• Working with other airlines, and other industries, to 
advance public policies needed to jumpstart the SAF 
market with tax incentives and levers to de-risk private 
capital investment; and  
• Continuing to advance initiatives for direct SAF offtake 
and foster partnerships to enable it. We were a founding 
member of the Aviators Group of the Sustainable 
Aviation Fuels Buyers Alliance, announced at COP26, 
bringing an operator’s perspective to collaborations 
driving demand and supply. And we developed 
additional SAF offtake agreements in collaboration with 
our airline partners in one world®.  
Second, we created a new venture investment arm,  
Alaska Star Ventures , to identify and enable technology that 
can accelerate our path to net zero. Our first two investments 
help us scale our access to and support for transformational 
technology: UP.Partners (focused on accelerating operational 
efficiency and advanced air mobility) and The Westly Group 
(focused on green energy, carbon offsetting and removal 
technologies and enabling a low-carbon circular economy).  We also partnered with hydrogen-electric powertrain 
manufacturer ZeroAvia to develop technology to retrofit 
regional aircraft as zero-emissions planes.  
RUNNING OUR BUSINESS FOR ALL WHO  
DEPEND ON US 
While we steward our impact on the planet, we’re ever conscious 
of the people who live on it—whose roots are in the land 
where we live and work and who keep our business moving.  
At Alaska, we believe every person deserves respect, to feel 
like they belong and to have equal opportunity regardless 
of race, ethnicity, disability, age, gender, gender identity or 
sexual orientation. We’re committed for the long-term to 
ensure that Alaska is a place where everyone sees themselves 
and can be their best.  
To make that a reality, we set a five-year goal of increasing the 
racial diversity of our leadership to reflect that of our frontline 
workforce. We’ve made real progress—from 16% Black, 
Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) leadership when we 
set the goal, to 18.3% as I write this— with more to come. 
We also established new programs to enable more young 
people to reach aviation and other careers, working with local 
schools and establishing our own Ascend Pilot Academy.
As an airline, we’re driven by connecting people. So, we 
decided to share our commitments publicly on an airplane 
itself, designed in collaboration with one of our most trusted 
long-term partners, UNCF. In 2021, we launched the Our 
Commitment aircraft, an expression of our accountability to 
change, to supporting education as an enabler of equity and to 
ensuring we’re an airline where everyone sees themselves and feels they belong. While racial equity remains an acute  
area of focus and need, we also launched a Pride aircraft  
and just last month launched gender-neutral grooming 
standards and development of gender-neutral uniform pieces 
to support everybody in feeling like they can be themselves  
in their uniforms.  
MAKING IT REAL 
In the pages ahead, you’ll find data on our impact and more 
detail on our strategy and accountability. Care is a part of 
everything we do, but we also measure our impact and share 
where we’re hitting our targets, where we’re not and what we 
learn. This is where the rubber meets the tarmac.  
There’s a lot more work ahead. We’ll keep pushing, with 
care, innovation, pragmatism, accountability, transparency 
and partnerships to ensure that aviation is a positive force in 
our world. We intend for Alaska to be here for a long time, 
creating great jobs, connecting communities and caring every 
mile of the way. 
Thank you for reading, for being interested and for being part 
of our story.  
Sincerely, 
Diana Birkett Rakow

PEOPLEPART ONE:  
The national racial reckoning of 2020 drove us to take an honest look at the role 
Alaska must play in ensuring people feel like they belong—as employees, guests 
and community partners. We are committed to increasing the racial diversity of our 
leadership team to reflect the racial diversity of our frontline workforce. To hold 
ourselves accountable, we tied executive pay incentives to our progress.  
In 2021, we reported a modest initial increase in leadership representation while 
putting in place the talent pipeline to recruit and advance more diverse leaders. 
Already in 2022, we’ve made greater leadership representation progress— 
currently 18.3% of our leaders are BIPOC. There is more work to do, but we’re on 
track to achieve our goals by 2025. These goals are supported by a strong culture  
of inclusion, measured by our “Inclusion Index Score” which increased by 
nine points in 2021.  
We believe education is a critical path to equity. We are longtime supporters of 
organizations like UNCF and SJ Aspires, and we've started internal programs that 
focus on supporting and funding education for aspiring BIPOC pilots. Pilots receive 
assistance with tuition and are offered a position at Horizon Air after graduation. In 
addition, we're proud to be the first airline to join the Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities (HBCU) Partnership Challenge, an effort to promote engagement and 
support between private companies and HBCUs.
While we were not able to engage directly with as many young people due to 
limitations of the pandemic, we look forward to jumpstarting our Aviation Day 
programs and other in-person engagements in 2022 to inspire and enable opportunity.
The following pages include current data detailing workforce profiles for 
race, ethnicity, gender, veteran status and disabilities compared to our 2025 
representation goals.WE’RE ALL ABOUT PEOPLE.

As we plan for Alaska and Horizon’s future, we’re actively working to train the next 
generation of pilots through a variety of programs. In March 2022, we launched the Ascend 
Pilot Academy in partnership with Hillsboro Aero Academy, a premier flight school in 
the Pacific Northwest. The Ascend Pilot Academy provides aspiring airline pilots with a 
streamlined, more financially accessible path to becoming a commercial pilot at Horizon and 
eventually Alaska. In just over a month since its launch, more than 700 prospective pilots 
signed up for the program - surpassing our goal by more than 600%!
For Horizon Air pilots seeking to become pilots for Alaska Airlines, the Pilot Pathways 
Program provides the most direct route. Horizon Air and Alaska Airlines share a goal of 
creating a rewarding career at the Air Group family of airlines and making the move from 
regional to a major airline, if desired, as simple as possible. 
Each year, a minimum of 30% of Alaska new-hire pilots will come from the Alaska Pilot 
Pathways Program. In 2021, 32% (51 pilots total) of our overall pilot new hires at Alaska were 
Horizon transfers through the Pathways program. Over the past year, a group of Black Alaska pilots got together to find creative ways to 
make aviation careers more attainable for aspiring pilots. 
Led by Ron Limes, an Alaska captain since 1999, the group worked in partnership with 
their colleagues, peers and leaders from across our company to develop a program called 
True North. 
The program will increase the diversity of our industry by directly funding students’ flight 
instruction, providing internship and mentorship opportunities and ultimately moving 
graduates to first officer positions at Horizon Air, with a confirmed path to Alaska.   
The program kicked off in 2021 with four students from two Historically Black Colleges 
and Universities (HBCUs), Delaware State University and University of Maryland-Eastern 
Shore. In the future, we plan to expand the program to other schools as well as broaden its 
scope of career opportunities within Alaska.PILOT PATHWAYS AND 
CAREER DEVELOPMENT  TRUE NORTHOUR COMMITMENT  
Inspired by and designed with Alaska’s Black employees and allies, 
we launched the Our Commitment aircraft with UNCF in 2021 to 
reflect our pledget to create an environment where everyone sees 
themselves and feels like they belong. This aircraft celebrates our 
long-standing partnership with UNCF, highlighting their incredible 
work to provide scholarships for students of color and enable more 
under-represented students to access excellent education and to 
graduate college.
This special paint theme features two quotes that anchor our values 
alongside the profiles of 14 young people in the Alaska Airlines family, 
each of whom brings their own story. This aircraft builds on more 
than 15 years of partnership with UNCF, which includes millions of 
miles donated to the organization by Alaska employees and guests 
in order to fly students to college tours and campuses at numerous 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Alaska has 
committed to donating an additional 10 million miles over the course 
of the program and has also established a scholarship fund to help 
overcome the financial obstacles of getting a college education.

241Alaska's largest source of emissions impacting the 
climate comes from our use of traditional jet fuel. 
We’ve prioritized programs that help us safely burn 
less fuel, and we’re working company-wide to use 
greener alternatives wherever possible. We care 
about the incredible communities we serve and live in 
and we want to keep them healthy and beautiful for 
generations to come.  
Last year, we committed to a five-part path to achieve 
net zero carbon emissions by 2040 and our goal is to 
be the most sustainable and fuel-efficient U.S. airline. 
We made progress in 2021 by advancing operational 
initiatives, taking delivery of more fuel-efficient aircraft, 
using more sustainable fuel and putting the building 
blocks in place for further progress on our journey.
Aviation is one of the most difficult sectors to 
decarbonize. Ultimately, sustainable travel will 
depend on expanding availability of new fuels and 
new technologies. While we are working to reduce 
emissions and improve efficiency in the short term, 
we’ve also begun to make some long term strategic 
investments. We created Alaska Star Ventures to 
specifically focus on and fund long-term sustainable 
innovation. And, to turn our sustainability commitment 
into real action, we tied company-wide performance-
based pay to measurable progress —because that's 
what creates deep organizational and cultural change.Flyways is a new software that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help dispatchers calculate the best way to get 
passengers to their destinations quickly and safely. It plans the most efficient routes, saving fuel and avoiding carbon emissions.

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY
We are exploring every opportunity to reduce 
fuel burn and carbon emissions within our 
operation, from gate to gate. We have long 
prioritized operational efficiency for safety, 
reliability and sustainability, and are laser 
focused on improvements. On-the-ground 
opportunities include preconditioned air use 
and single-engine taxi (where possible). In the 
air, we’re using new technology to improve 
routes and save fuel. 
FLEET RENEWAL
In 2021, Alaska took delivery of 11 Boeing 
737-9 Max Aircraft. By 2026 we plan to have 
up to 145 MAX aircraft in our fleet. The new 
aircraft are 25% more fuel efficient than the 
aircraft they replace and we'll continue to work 
with Boeing on ways to improve efficiency 
over time.
SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL /parenleft.caseSAF/parenright.case * 
SAF is the aviation industry’s most significant 
opportunity to  significantly reduce carbon 
emissions. It is a safe, certified drop-in fuel 
that meets all jet fuel standards to reduce 
carbon emissions by as much as 80% on a 
lifecycle basis. In 2021, Alaska worked with 
partners like skyNRG to collaborate on future 
SAF production. We continue to work with 
corporate partners and government officials 
to push for ways to scale and mature the 
market for SAF. Today, there is not enough 
SAF at a volume and price that supports our 
operational needs. NEW PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY  
Electric and hybrid-electric aircraft, including 
those using hydrogen, may be available for 
regional aircraft within the next two decades. 
In 2021, we launched a partnership with 
ZeroAvia to support development of hybrid 
hydrogen-electric powertrain technology for 
regional aircraft.
CARBON OFFSETS  
Carbon offsets should always be the last 
resort of any effort to get to net zero. 
Air travel is one of the hardest sectors to 
decarbonize, and we need to evaluate 
every option until SAF and new propulsion 
technologies are viable and available at scale. 
For any carbon offsets we do use, we will 
work with third-party experts to source 
high-quality offsets with net offset value 
and a preference for carbon-removal and 
sequestration approaches which are durable, 
verified in carbon accounting, do no harm and 
do not displace emissions to another project.
*This is the most variable contribution to the pathway. It could 
contribute more or less carbon emissions reduction, based on 
how much we can advance the supply and commercial 
viability of the SAF market in the next 10 to 15 years.ALASKA AIRLINES FLIGHT PLAN TO

FLYING GREENER16
Alaska has invested in efficiency and innovated new technologies to reduce the climate 
impact of our flights. About 99% of our core climate impact is created by our use of jet fuel, 
and we are focused on reducing it by upgrading our fleet, continuing to improve and update 
our operations to reduce fuel use and emissions where possible, using more sustainable  
fuels, and innovating for the future. Here are a few examples of our efforts so far:OUR CARBON
IMPACT
GROUND POWER AT GATES
When we arrive at the gate, we strive to use ground 
power instead of the aircraft’s auxiliary power unit to save 
fuel and emissions. Executing an efficient aircraft turn 
could save 469 lbs of CO2 or the equivalent of driving a 
car 535 miles.GROUND SERVICE EQUIPMENT  
We have invested in electric ground-service equipment 
(GSE) and have partnered with our airports to install 
electric charging infrastructure. Our GSE fleet is 34% 
electric. By 2025 our GSE fleet will be 50% more 
efficient than it was in 2020.  SUSTAINABLE AVIATION 
FUEL (SAF) 
Alaska and Horizon have been 
advancing and promoting the 
development and use of 
sustainable aviation fuels for 
over a decade.  In 2011, we 
were the first domestic carrier 
to fly multiple scheduled routes 
powered by a SAF blend, and 
we are using blended SAF 
regularly in San Francisco. In 
2020 we partnered with Boeing 
to test 100% sustainable 
aviation fuel (in one engine) on 
our ecoDemonstrator aircraft, 
proving 100% SAF viability. WINGLETS
To further reduce the carbon 
impact of our aircraft, Alaska 
retrofitted all possible 737s 
with winglets (turned up 
extensions at the tips of the 
wings) back in 2017. These 
increased our fuel efficiency 
3% to 5%. All new 737 MAX 
aircraft come with winglets, 
and due to their overall 
design and engines, these 
new aircraft are about 25% 
more efficient than the 
airplanes they replace. INVESTMENTS IN 
EFFICIENT AIRCRAFT
We announced our commitment to buy up to 145 
additional MAX aircraft, allowing us to retire our 
older, much less-efficient  planes. We’ll continue 
to work with Boeing to maximize the efficiency of 
the aircraft we buy. Additionally, we’ve started an 
exciting partnership with ZeroAvia, a company 
working to create zero emissions regional aircraft 
this decade. 
MORE EFFICIENT FLIGHT 
NAVIGATION 
Wide Area Augmentation System 
(WAAS) technology and the Alaska 
pioneered Required Navigation 
Performance (RNP) technology use 
satellites and onboard computers to 
fly more precise approaches, 
enable landing in low-visibility 
weather, and save about 1.2M 
gallons of fuel per year. In 2021 
Alaska started a first of its kind 
partnership with a software 
company, Flyways. Flyways uses 
artificial intelligence and machine 
learning to help dispatchers 
calculate the most efficient routes, 
avoiding carbon emissions. CARBON EMISSIONS
When we arrive at the gate, we strive to use 
ground power instead of the aircraft’s auxiliary 
power unit (APU) to save fuel and emissions. In 
2020, we tested and rolled out updates to 
ground and onboard processes to improve 
reliability of ground power and air, and to 
reduce the APU. Additionally in 2020, our flight 
operations manuals were updated with a green 
policy and the practice of taxiing with one 
engine as often as possible, where conditions 
and aircraft allow, was emphasized 
in pilot training.USE OUR APP.
Go paperless by using our 
award-winning app to board your 
next flight using a digital boarding 
pass. Millions of guests use mobile 
boarding passes each year to 
streamline their travel experience 
and reduce our use of paper.
PACK LIGHT.
Be conscientious when packing for 
your trip. Each pound makes a 
difference to our CO 2 emissions. If 
each passenger packed 5 lbs. lighter, 
it would decrease our CO 2e emissions 
by 11,800 metric tons each year.
#FILLBEFOREYOUFLY
Help us reduce inflight waste by 
bringing a refillable water bottle to 
the airport and fill it up once you’re 
past security. If just 10% of our 
guests brought a pre-filled water 
bottle it would save 680,000 plastic 
bottles per year.
OFFSET YOUR FLIGHT.
Join us and leading airports in 
reducing the climate impact of travel 
by choosing credible carbon offsets 
through The Good Traveler program. 
This collaboration between airports 
and Alaska helps guests invest in 
local carbon reduction projects.  
HELP OTHERS.
Help us support charities and people 
in need in the communities we serve 
by donating your miles. In 2020, our

Meeting the challenge
Aviation is a difficult sector to 
decarbonize, and while multiple 
strategies are needed on this path, 
sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) is 
the most significant decarbonization 
lever for the next few decades. 
But current SAF availability is less 
than 1% of total fuel demand, and 
the cost is three to five times more 
than conventional jet fuel. Scaling 
this market requires concurrently 
addressing price and volume through 
multiple strategies to grow availability 
and commercial viability of SAF. 
We’re grateful to work with partners 
across and beyond the aviation 
industry toward that shared goal. SUSTAINABLE  
AVIATION 
FUEL
6. Operations & Customer Demand
SAF is a proven drop-in technology, with reduced carbon intensity, increased energy density, and local air 
quality bene/f_its such as reduced /f_ine particulate matter emissions. We have a collective opportunity to ensure 
travelers are informed about the bene/f_its and safety of SAF, and to engage them in supporting its 
development and use. 5. Engine Infrastructure
While safe certi/f_ication of SAF is clear for available technologies, SAF is currently only allowed to be used for up to 
50% of total fuel in an engine. Aircraft and engine manufacturers are updating their technologies and demonstrating 
the feasibility of SAF blends up to 100%.  4. Pricing, Purchase & Accounting
Partners across industries and around the globe are working, with NGO support, to clarify carbon accounting 
systems and transaction traceability that can encourage shared investment in SAF for concurrent Scope 1 and 
Scope 3 bene/f_its. This work also enables demand signals, which can in turn de-risk private investment in SAF. 
Additionally, government tax incentives for SAF (state low carbon fuel standards, federal blenders tax credit) 
are needed to reduce price and drive economies of scale in the sector. 3. Transportation & Storage
SAF is what is known as a “drop-in fuel,” meaning it can be incorporated into existing jet fuel transportation and 
storage, but SAF production facilities need to be eﬃciently connected to existing infrastructure or new transport 
and storage capacity needs to be developed. This requires reviewing pipeline policies and capacity to allow for 
growing SAF volume, and additional government /f_inancial and permitting support for transport and storage 
infrastructure, compatible with SAF production locations and airports.  2. Facilities for Production, Re/f_ining, Blending
The infrastructure needed to produce SAF includes retro/f_itting or constructing new facilities close to feedstocks 
(i.e. municipal dumps) and facilities to blend larger volumes as they come online. This should be done with an eye 
to geographic equity and price parity, diﬀerent from the current market for traditional jet fuel. We need durable 
public policy to provide grants and /f_inancing options for SAF facility construction, to encourage private sector 
investment in SAF, and to streamline permitting of SAF production and transport facilities.  1. Commercial-Scale Feedstock Quantities
Sustainable and scalable SAF feedstocks can come from many sources including waste streams from land/f_ills, forestry and 
agricultural residues, and over time from additional sources such as recaptured carbon dioxide. We need to invest in 
feedstocks, make information available on sources and sustainability of feedstocks, and to share this information publicly, 
including through public-private partnerships like the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA). In some cases, permitting 
changes are needed to make waste sources available to produce SAF. Additionally, as technology develops to enable new 
sources for SAF, like using electricity to make fuel, we’ll need to ensure safety certi/f_ications and pathways are approved. 
In 2021, after a hiatus due to Covid-19 
safety protocols, we restarted our onboard 
recycling program. Our former recycling 
audit methodologies were also not 
possible due to Covid restrictions. We're 
working on developing new protocols that 
are both safe and effective to ensure our 
progress to target. 
We made significant progress toward our 
goal of replacing the top five sources of 
waste from our onboard service by 2025, 
having replaced the top two in 2021. 
Working with Boxed Water, we replaced 
32 million plastic water bottles per year 
with recyclable water cartons that have 
plant-based caps. We also replaced plastic 
water cups with recyclable paper ones. 
These alternatives enable us to keep 1.8 
million pounds of plastic waste out of the 
landfill each year.Alaska is committed to keeping our rivers and oceans healthy. We’ve partnered with the 
Bonneville Environmental Foundation to restore habitats up and down the West Coast, including 
an Icicle Creek restoration project in Washington State and drought response work on the 
Dungeness River. Further, through our partnership with travel2change, we're making it easier for 
travelers to discover and participate in efforts to protect critical ecosystems in Hawai'i. Our West 
Coast Wonders aircraft, launched last year, is inspired by the beautiful places we fly to  
and encourages everyone to take action with us to protect our planet. REDUCING WASTEBoxed Water is better. PROTECTING HABITATS  
AND SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
We fly to some pretty amazing destinations. And we have a responsibility not just to protect these special places, but to make them better. 
We are supporting West Coast habitats by reducing our waste impact and balancing our water impact.SUPPORTING HEALTHY ECOSYSTEMS

NITIESPART THREE:  We started out in 1932 connecting small towns across Alaska. 90 years 
later, connecting small towns and large urban areas, we still know that 
taking care of each another is how we all will continue to thrive. 
Investing in communities is part of our DNA, whether it’s through our 
employees volunteering to restore agricultural lands in Hawai‘i  or to 
fill and deliver boxes from a local food bank; through a grant from the 
Alaska Airlines Foundation; or through the ecosystem of small business 
relationships that are part of our supply chain.
In 2021, we set bold goals for public leadership to advance racial equity 
through education and opportunity. We are grateful to partner on this 
journey with nonprofit organizations across the United States who are 
working to inspire and enable young people to imagine and reach their 
goals. We continue to learn from our partners and discover new ways 
we can enable career opportunities together – whether in aviation or 
beyond. You’ll see a few examples in these pages. 
We also set out to continue diversifying our supply chain and will have 
more to share about that journey in the years ahead. In the meantime, 
we’re proud to source signature products such as chocolate, beer, and 
wine from our neighbors, and to partner with locally owned businesses

COVID RESPONSE: 
VACCINE TRANSPORT 
& DELIVERY
Alaska Air Cargo worked closely with pharmaceutical 
and cargo partners, as well as the Alaska Department of 
Health and Social Services, to organize and ensure the safe 
travels of critical Covid-19 vaccine shipments. 
The state of Alaska is unique in that 80% of 
communities are only accessible by air or water, and 
therefore most vaccines must be distributed by plane. 
Alaska Airlines has been transporting critical medication 
and cargo to the state of Alaska for 89 years—in 
many ways serving as a lifeline to 20 hub communities 
throughout the state.
Vaccine shipments started in December of 2020. In 
2021, Alaska moved a total of 606 shipments—that’s 
1,103 parcels of Covid-19 vaccines delivered to many 
rural and remote areas of our namesake state!  SMALL BUSINESSES
We’re proud to support the communities we live in and fly to, and this includes supporting local businesses 
whenever possible. 
On board, our MVP Gold guests are treated to a jcoco seasonal chocolate bar by Seattle Chocolate. 
Headquartered just a few miles from Alaska Airlines, the woman-owned chocolate business has been an 
Alaska partner since 2013—a relationship strengthened by our shared values of sustainability, philanthropy 
and customer care.
Alaska also buys from local breweries and wineries up and down the West Coast, including Washington’s 
Fremont Brewing and California’s Broken Earth Winery. Fremont Brewing's mission is to "brew great beer 
and do good." They are advocates for conservation and their production process produces zero-waste. 
Likewise, the Broken Earth Winery team focuses on sustainable practices by minimizing water use, reducing 
packaging weight and waste, and installing solar panels at their facilities. 
In our namesake state, we support and work closely with Alaska Native-owned business Nana Management 
Services (NMS) and have for 22 years. NMS shares our focus of environmental sustainability and ensures 
our planes in Fairbanks and Juneau are catered to the highest quality.
These and many other locally-owned businesses create a strong foundation of jobs and opportunity across 
our communities.

STUDENTS WITH THE 
FUTURE OF FLIGHT
For more than a decade, Alaska Airlines has partnered with 
the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP), 
an organization focused on increasing opportunities for Alaska 
students in STEM-related careers. Alaska Airlines provides free 
transportation for students in middle and high schools in rural 
Alaska, allowing them to attend award-winning programs at the 
University of Alaska Anchorage.
In August 2021, we hosted 250 ANSEP students at our 
Anchorage hangar to learn about careers in our industry and 
tour Boeing's 737-9 ecoDemonstrator. The partnership with 
Boeing and Alaska Airlines allowed ANSEP students to gain 
insight from experts in the fields of science, engineering and 
aviation and learn about how the ecoDemonstrator accelerates 
innovation by improving maintenance efficiency, enhancing 
safety, reducing waste and informing climate modeling.
In November, we did the same at San Francisco International 
Airport with students from the San Francisco Unified School 
Districts. Students had a chance to explore and learn about 
the technology on the ecoDemonstrator, to talk with aviation 
professionals about potential career paths, and even to meet 
and talk with artist Anne Neely about using creativity as a lens 
to understand climate impacts and to create positive change.

MAKING  
FLYING   
MATTERPART FOUR:  
Air travel connects us in many ways. Connecting families, 
friends, and colleagues across the globe – and creating special 
moments through flight. As you’ll see on the next page, in 2021 
making flying matter also meant responding quickly to help 
bring families to safety, both on our own planes and by donating 
38 million miles for Afghan refugee travel. 
Throughout the year, we have opportunities to make wishes 
come true for children, to honor our nation’s heroes with travel 
to see the war memorials in Washington D.C., and to make all 
feel welcome flying with us. We also feel great responsibility  
to the places we fly, reflected in many of the organizations  
we support. 
Our employees and guests step up in big ways all year long.  
Our employees give back to their communities through their 
own personal gifts, and through volunteering their time with 
local nonprofit organizations. As a company, we match both 
efforts with financial contributions to the organizations our 
employees support.
Our guests can donate miles to organizations that reflect our 
values. As travel resumed in 2021 and in-person volunteer 
opportunities slowly returned, we saw a positive impact in 
volunteer hours and miles donated. Seeing those miles go to 
support so many throughout the country unites us all in making 
flying truly matter.

Last year, Alaska joined other airlines in the U.S. to help 
ensure that every Afghan evacuee received a donated 
ticket to their new home. 
“One of the pilots from a refugee charter flight reported 
back: ‘They had nothing—no luggage, just hope.’ And 
that’s exactly why we’re stepping up to lend a hand,” 
said Ben Minicucci, CEO of Alaska Airlines. “This cause 
is close to my heart. My parents immigrated from Italy to 
Canada in the 1950s, and I understand how challenging 
it can be to start rebuilding a new life in an unfamiliar 
place. Showing the Afghan people that we care is the best 
thing we can do. That’s why I’m so proud to contribute 
to this collective effort, which represents the best of 
who we are in the airline industry and in our country.”One example of a LIFT grant from the Alaska Airlines 
Foundation is Year Up. Their focus is on closing the 
Opportunity Divide by ensuring young professionals gain  
the skills, experiences, and support needed to reach their full 
potential. These young people have critical skills – resilience 
and motivation. Year Up is committed to ensuring equitable 
access to economic opportunity, education, and justice  
for all young adults—no matter their background, income,  
or zip code.
Year Up represents one of 51 grants awarded through the 
Alaska Airlines Foundation in 2021, totaling over $755,000. Juma Ventures is a nonprofit social enterprise that operates 
businesses with the purpose of employing young people. 
Juma’s YouthConnect program combines employment and 
job training at social enterprises with a complementary 
suite of services focused on building financial capability 
and career pathways toward middle-skills careers and a 
living wage. Attending a sporting event in San Francisco at 
Oracle Park or the Chase Center, you will be greeted by a 
team from Juma’s YouthConnect when you visit one of the 
many concessions. 
YouthConnect works to ensure that, by age 25, young adults 
are on a career trajectory toward a living wage, economic 
well-being, and prosperity. We are proud to support this 
important program. Mālama is the Hawaiian cultural value meaning to 
nurture and care for. As Hawai‘i welcomed visitors back 
to the Islands last year we were excited to work with 
travel2change to inspire our guests to be mindful  
travelers and to help keep Hawai‘i strong and beautiful  
for future generations. 
travel2change is an environmentally sustainable 
give-back model centered on fun and impact, which 
cultivates mutually-beneficial relationships between local 
communities and guests.
Alaska employees joined volunteers from travel2change 
to help restore agricultural lands at Kāko‘o ‘Ōiwi, a 
community-based non-profit on the island of O‘ahu and 
one of travel2change’s partner organizations.

SASB CLIMATE NARRATIVE
MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE OF  
CLIMATE-RELATED ISSUES
Our Sustainability and ESG team works through multiple 
avenues to identify and evaluate climate risks, including 
input from employees, investors, governments, NGOs, 
reporting organizations, trade associations and key 
stakeholders within and outside of the aviation industry. 
Our Executive Committee of senior management 
engages in sustainability issues on an ongoing basis and 
considers the climate impact of decisions around fleet 
and fuel efficiency. A metric of climate impact is part of 
our all-employee performance-based pay plan.  
BOARD GOVERNANCE  
Alaska Air Group and the Board have prioritized 
sustainability and ESG as a key part of our company 
strategy and have regular discussions about this work, 
including conversations specific to climate impact. The 
Governance, Nominating and Corporate Responsibility 
Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing the 
company’s practices and reporting with respect to the 
breadth of ESG matters, including voluntary ESG goals 
and disclosure, annual reporting and environmental and 
climate impacts. This Committee includes members with 
deep experience in energy and environmental impact 
from two different industries, as well as in governance, safety and risk. These perspectives and those of the full 
Board drive robust oversight of our ESG strategy and 
initiatives. In early 2021, the Board created a dedicated 
Climate Working Group to oversee, with management, 
climate goals and progress. This working group continues 
to provide insight on areas such as ESG disclosure and 
elements of the plan to achieve net zero.  
The Governance, Nominating and Corporate Responsibility 
Committee reviews ESG / sustainability performance 
quarterly, including performance on enterprise-wide 
publicly reported sustainability goals and climate-related 
issues. The Audit Committee reviews Alaska’s enterprise-
wide risk analysis and oversight program, designed to 
identify the various risks faced by the organization, assign 
responsibility for managing those risks to individual 
executives as well as align these risks with Board oversight. 
The Safety Committee receives regular updates on 
environmental risk, compliance and policy, including 
but not limited to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction 
Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Finally, the 
Compensation and Leadership Development Committee is 
responsible for oversight of advancing diversity, equity and 
inclusion in our employee population including recruitment, 
hiring, retention, development and culture, as well as for 
the integration of both climate and DEI goals into all-
employee and executive compensation, respectively.MANAGEMENT ENGAGEMENT  
A member of the company’s top Executive Committee 
has formal responsibility for driving progress and 
disclosure in Sustainability and ESG, reporting directly 
to the CEO. And, because this work is inherently cross-
functional, we have also formalized management-level 
ESG governance and oversight. An ESG Executive 
Steering Committee meets about monthly for oversight 
of performance and work toward our goals and is 
responsible for ensuring progress. Additional Steering 
Committees focused on climate, and specific to 
the sustainable aviation fuels part of our path to net 
zero, bring explicit focus and reports progress to 
the ESG Executive Steering Committee. On the DEI 
and social impact fronts, cross-functional leadership 
groups are structured to ensure progress on our hiring, 
representation and public leadership goals. Finally, 
a group dedicated to our ESG Goals and Disclosure 
meets quarterly to review data on progress to our 2025 
goals and to ensure that we’re bringing appropriate 
stewardship and transparency to the breadth of ESG 
matters. These groups are staffed by senior executives 
across all areas of accountability for delivering on 
ESG—including operations, finance, human resources, 
legal, commercial divisions, government affairs, 
philanthropy and more. APPENDICES38
CLIMATE STRATEGY  
Alaska’s most material sustainability priority is reducing 
our carbon emissions from burning fuel. Jet fuel is over 
99% of our direct climate footprint and represents our 
second largest expense as a company. Alaska has had 
a multi-decade focus on increasing the fuel efficiency 
of our fleet and on developing and deploying new 
technologies to optimize our routes and minimizing 
fuel use in our operation. In addition, Alaska has a over 
decade of leadership in piloting and pioneering low-
carbon sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), directly supporting 
the development and deployment of the SAF market in 
partnership with many key organizations. As these fuels 
are safe and certified as drop-in fuels, our work has moved 
past piloting to developing durable long-term offtake 
agreements and pushing for public policy to accelerate 
the commercial viability of these fuels and maturation of 
the market. As a member of the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) and Airlines for America (A4A), and 
the oneworld alliance, we are working alongside other 
airlines to address the challenge of climate change. We 
have adopted a set of global targets to mitigate CO2 
emissions from air transport and are working to meet 
these goals through (1) improved technology, including the 
deployment and more local availability and manufacturing of sustainable low-carbon fuels; (2) more efficient aircraft 
operations; (3) infrastructure improvements, including 
modernized air traffic management systems; and (4) a 
single global market-based measure to fill the remaining 
emissions gap on international routes (CORSIA).  
Alaska Airlines began setting and tracking progress 
to a voluntary climate goal over a decade ago and is 
currently driving progress on our five-part path to net 
zero by 2040, through operational efficiency initiatives, 
upgrading our fleet to add more Boeing 737 MAX aircraft 
which are about 25% more fuel efficient than the aircraft 
they replace, using and building partnerships to advance 
sustainable aviation fuels, supporting the development 
of zero-emissions and hybrid propulsion technology, and 
leveraging credible carbon offsetting technologies that fit 
our criteria only where needed to close gaps to target in 
future years. More details on progress can be found in  
this report. 
TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE  
We report our greenhouse gas impact in our annual 
sustainability report, which includes the SASB metrics 
for aviation and additional information about our climate 
governance, risks and opportunities in a TCFD appendix. 
We also submit our climate metrics to CDP. OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY 
In 2021, we were the first airline to launch use of Flyways, 
an artificial intelligence and machine learning software that 
helps dispatchers optimize the flight routes they prepare—
saving time, fuel and emissions. This year, we also 
integrated a new green section into our flight operations 
manual and kicked off a campaign to improve the use of 
preconditioned air and ground power to reduce use of the 
auxiliary power unit and commensurate fuel burn. We also 
began to lay out the path to renew and replace our ground 
vehicles fleet with electric and low-emission alternatives. 
We also continue to use Required Navigation Performance 
(RNP) approaches and departures where possible, leveraging 
this performance-based navigation technique to fly safer, 
more reliable approaches. For years, we’ve advocated to 
expand use of RNP technologies to airports across the 
country, and to enable broader air traffic infrastructure to 
support that goal. RNP technologies save an estimated 1.2 
million gallons of fuel annually due to reduced track miles.  
FLEET  
We fly an efficient fleet, with split scimitar winglets on all 
our eligible 737 aircraft, improving average fuel efficiency 
by over 34,000 gallons per aircraft each year. Aircraft 
fitted with split scimitar winglets are 3-5% more fuel 
efficient than those without winglets, and in 2019, the 
scimitar winglets modification saved approximately 4.5 
million gallons of fuel.  
 
 With 145 Boeing 737-MAX aircraft on order, between firm 
orders and options, and over a dozen already delivered, the 
company continues its fleet efficiency journey. These new 
aircraft have 25% lower fuel burn and carbon emissions 
per seat than the A320 aircraft being retired from our fleet.  
SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUELS (SAF)  
While we continue working with partners across the industry 
and beyond to advance public policy to mature and scale the 
SAF market for commercial viability, we have also pursued 
our own initiatives to use and advance the fuel. Procuring 
SAF that is priced competitively with traditional fuel has been 
difficult, so we are working on multiple fronts to find the best 
ways to obtain the volume of fuel we need at the right price. 
We have partnership agreements with the Port of Seattle, 
San Francisco Airport, sustainable aviation fuel companies 
Neste and SkyNRG Americas and with Microsoft to use SAF 
to offset the climate impact of their business travel between 
Seattle and California. We use SAF on an ongoing basis in 
San Francisco and were one of the three airlines to launch 
this offtake. This year, we helped found the Aviators Group 
of the Sustainable Aviation Fuels Buyers Alliance to bring an 
operator's perspective to advance corporate collaborations 
and partnerships for offtake.  
ELECTRIFIED PROPULSION 
While the most significant medium-term step we can take 
to decarbonize aviation is to use SAF, electrified or hybrid-
electric propulsion systems can play a role in enabling zero 
emissions regional flight even in the near-to-medium term. 
That’s why we’ve partnered with ZeroAvia to support their development of a hybrid hydrogen-electric powertrain 
system and technology to retrofit traditional aircraft for 
zero-emissions operation.  
CREDIBLE CARBON OFFSETS  
Today, Alaska does not purchase carbon offsets, prioritizing 
investments in fundamental emissions avoidance or changes 
within the operation—such as through use of sustainable 
aviation fuels—to decarbonize. However, we anticipate 
needing these technologies to close the gap to our targets 
given the inherent challenges in decarbonizing aviation, and 
we will share more in future years.  
We provide our passengers with an opportunity to offset 
their carbon footprint through The Good Traveler program, 
which invests those funds to support localized carbon 
reduction projects.  
ADDITIONAL EFFORTS  
We recognize that supporting the climate requires 
effort from all sides. For example, we partner with 
airports on charging infrastructure for electric ground-
service equipment and pursue green building and 
energy efficiency in our building footprint including 
LEED certification for new buildings and retrofitting 
existing buildings with more energy-efficient lighting 
and technology. We also remain relentlessly focused on 
reducing onboard waste and recycling as well as balancing 
our operational water impact through habitat restoration 
projects on the West Coast.OUR CLIMATE INVESTMENTS

ALASKA AIR GROUP  
SAFETY NARRATIVE FOR SASB
Safety is the foundation of everything we do and remains 
our top priority. We have an unwavering commitment 
to run a safe operation and we will not compromise this 
commitment. Alaska and Horizon were the first major 
U.S. airlines to receive FAA validation and acceptance of 
their Safety Management System (SMS) in 2016, and we 
are at the continuous improvement level. Report It!, our 
mobile safety reporting application, makes it easier for 
employees to file safety reports. Alaska has been on the 
IOSA registration audit since 2005. In early 2021, we were 
the leading US airline on the AirlineRatings.com list of the 
world's Top 20 Safest Airlines. We believe that maintaining 
safe operations—through adherence to well-defined 
processes and ensuring every Air Group employee is 
aware of their individual contribution to our operation— 
is critical to on-time performance. The rigor we apply to 
running a safe operation has resulted in Alaska consistently 
being one of the top airlines in North America for on-time 
performance; and Horizon was recognized again as the 
leader in on-time performance among regional airlines.  
MANAGEMENT AND  
GOVERNANCE OF SAFETY  
Our Safety Management System (SMS) utilizes multiple 
levels of performance review in all areas of the company to create visibility to hazards and safety risk as well as 
to ensure management accountability with mitigation 
controls and corrective action plans. The SMS uses 
multiple safety assurance systems to identify hazards and 
continuously evaluate the control environment to ensure 
the highest margins for repeatable safety performance. 
Our Executive Committee of senior management review 
safety quarterly with our VP of Safety and Security. Our 
Executive Safety Review Board also occurs quarterly, 
attended by all operational VPs and the COO. These 
meetings are intended to analyze safety performance and 
to discuss continued improvement of our safety culture 
and process. Safety risks and opportunities factor into key 
business decisions. The Safety Committee of the Alaska 
Air Group (AAG) Board reviews our safety performance 
quarterly, including our performance on enterprise-wide 
safety goals, some of which are also integrated into 
employee pay. Alaska’s enterprise-wide risk analysis and 
oversight program is designed to identify the various 
risks faced by the organization, assign responsibility for 
managing those risks to individual executives as well as 
align these risks with Board oversight.  
GOALS  
For 2021 our goals were to increase employee safety 
reporting by 10% over 2020 baseline (reports per 
employee), and to maintain safety’s high priority among employees at 83% favorable, as measured in our annual 
employee survey. We also measured safety perception 
among guests with a goal of maintaining a 90%.
In addition, as a member of the Airlines for America 
(A4A), we have active representation on the Safety 
Council with all other major U.S. airlines in order to 
develop strategies to address systemic safety issues 
through continuous improvement of safety management 
systems and collaboration with FAA and other aviation 
stakeholders. The council guides annual initiative targets 
to improve safety risks to include: 1. Cross-carrier 
collaboration on flight operations, cabin operations, 
ground operations and maintenance risk mitigation 
procedures 2. Ensuring active flight data monitoring 
and reporting systems of airline operations 3. Reducing 
injuries through improved procedures, training and 
technology 4. Reducing aircraft ground damage through 
innovative ground service equipment technology, 
procedures and training 5. Data sharing of safety risks 
across safety management systems. SASB SAFETY NARRATIVE

GOVERNANCE
DISCLOSURE INDEX RESPONSE 
a) Board Oversight The Board of Directors believes that sustainability is a leading part of our company strategy and have regular discussions and deliberation about AAG’s ESG (environmental, social and governance) efforts 
including our climate goals, actions and performance. The Governance, Nominating and Corporate Responsibility Committee oversees the company’s ESG program and is responsible for oversight of the 
strategy, goals and public disclosures on ESG matters. Every quarter, the Governance, Nominating and Corporate Responsibility Committee reviews performance on enterprise-wide publicly reported 
sustainability goals and climate-related issues.  
In early 2021, the Board created a dedicated Climate Working Group to oversee management’s climate strategy and path to net zero. This working group is comprised of four members from the board who bring 
deep expertise in energy, aviation, finance and governance. This working group meets several times a year to evaluate and advise on specific pathways and levers to achieve AAG’s ambitious climate goals.  
The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board oversees the inclusion of ESG performance metrics into incentive programs, which includes factoring a carbon intensity metric 
into the company’s all-employee performance-based pay program, and a measure of diverse representation in leadership into executive compensation. The Safety Committee of the Board receives regular 
updates on environmental risks and compliance, and the Audit Committee oversees the enterprise-wide risk analysis and oversight program which is designed to identify the various risks faced by the 
organization, assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with Board oversight.
b) Role of Management We have formalized governance and oversight of ESG at the management level. As a member of the Executive Team, the Senior Vice President (SVP) of Public Affairs and Sustainability is responsible for leading 
ESG strategy and development, internal and external communications, crisis response and reputation management, government affairs and corporate philanthropy. The SVP also chairs AAG’s ESG Executive 
Steering Committee, which includes leaders from Finance, Flight Operations, Strategy and Execution Management, Airports, Human Resources, Information Technology and more. This Committee is responsible 
for overseeing the performance toward our climate goals, providing input on AAG’s climate strategy and ensuring progress on our public goals. The ESG Executive Steering Committee meets about monthly.  
Additionally, several working groups are assigned responsibilities on specific elements related to our climate strategy including operational efficiency and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The working groups 
meet biweekly or monthly and provide updates to the ESG Executive Steering Committee. Finally, a group dedicated to our ESG Goals and Disclosure meets quarterly to review data on progress to goals to 
ensure accuracy and transparency in our ESG data, performance and public disclosures.

Climate Risks 
b) Business, Strategy and Financial 
Planning 
c) Resilience of the Organization’s 
Strategy PHYSICAL RISKS 
Extreme weather events such as wildfires, winter storms and heat waves have the potential to impact our operations and/or damage our assets. In the last few years, our Pacific 
Northwest hubs have experienced increased extreme heat events, smoke from forest fires in the summer and increased snow events in the winter. And wildfires have also impacted our 
California hubs. The increased frequency of such events impacts our operating results and may further increase in the longer-term. The impacts of sea-level rise increased coastal flooding 
conditions that have impacts on our coastal airports. Melting permafrost in Alaska has led to infrastructure impacts on our terminal buildings. All of these combined lead to additional 
facilities management and infrastructure modification of runways and terminals which requires increased investment from AAG to continue to operate over the long-term. 
Our approach to physical risk: We work closely with our airport partners to understand and mitigate risks to infrastructure and protect our assets. We take measures to improve the 
resiliency of our facilities and our operations that considers the shift in climate patterns. Examples include upgrading HVAC that support our critical systems, exploring alternative power 
sources for HVAC, aggressively managing deicing operations and supply, using Flyways to optimize routes relative to weather conditions and evaluating and updating our operations 
guidelines to deal with extreme heat and smoke during fire seasons. We develop and invest in our facilities to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact, and have a multi-
year airport investment plan for infrastructure in the state of Alaska. We continue to work with airport partners in developing sufficient charging infrastructure to continue moving our 
ground fleet to more electric and low-emission alternatives.  
TRANSITION RISKS 
Changing customer preference due to increased awareness of the climate impact from flying and the continued impact from the Covid-19 pandemic could weaken the demand for our 
services. Customers may also choose to fly with competitors who they perceive to be more sustainable. This could pose risks to our market share and revenue if we are unable to meet 
customer expectations. 
Our approach to transition risks: Alaska is executing on a five-part path to achieve net zero, as well as ensuring the data and metrics needed to manage performance on our path to net 
zero and to report on our progress. With oversight of the governance systems noted above, we will continue to refine our strategies, engage employee workgroups and establish external 
partnerships such as with corporate customers, alternative fuel producers, oneworld alliance members and others to advance this path and to deliver on customer expectations.  
In the medium term, incentives such as low carbon fuel standard regulations in some states and other incentive-based policies could enable procurement of SAF, while a delay in 
government action on SAF policies could put the market and SAF supply at greater risk. Other regulatory risks include increased complexity of reporting that draws attention away from 
execution and/or increased fuel prices under potential carbon pricing schemes. Additionally, the cost of offsets could increase with greater demand or tighter parameters. We remain 
actively engaged on policy activity alongside industry and non-industry partners for policies to enable the alternative fuel and other technology to enable decarbonization including 
incentive-based policies and support for private sector financing to reduce cost and increase production. 
In the long term, successfully decarbonizing aviation depends on technology and policy support to scale low carbon solutions including SAF, electric or hybrid aviation, and infrastructure 
to support these alternatives. This includes support for blending facilities, electric and green hydrogen, as well as certifications and approvals from relevant authorities. We may need to 
increase investment in SAF and development of new aircraft technologies.  
In addition to engagement in public policy, we work closely with our supply partners and trade associations to understand development in technologies and their potentials, and 
encourage R&D through ventures, startups and NGOs. We also established our own venture arm, Alaska Star Ventures, to scale how we directly identify and enable technologies that can 
accelerate our path to net zero. We are on a journey, learning continuously and working with our airport and aircraft partners to address these longer-term, systemic challenges. AAG TCFD INDEX

Strategy CLIMATE OPPORTUNITIES 
Our biggest opportunities in the transition to a low-carbon economy are to improve our operating efficiency, to expand low-emission services to our customers and to improve the 
predictability of renewable jet fuel pricing and supply with a robust, stable, commercially-viable market for SAF. Our short-term strategy is focused on operational efficiency and 
fleet renewal as these two levers are under our most direct control, and viable today. We have long prioritized operational efficiency and will continue to reduce fuel consumption by 
identifying and expanding best practices, such as using Required Navigation Performance (RNP) and Flyways technologies to reduce fuel consumption. Additionally, we are committed 
to regain our position to have the most fuel-efficient fleet. We recently finalized our order for up to 145 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to replace less fuel-efficient planes and will continue 
working with aircraft and engine manufacturers to further improve efficiency over time. In 2021, we partnered with Boeing on the ecoDemonstrator program to test technologies that 
will improve aviation sustainability and safety in the years ahead, and to raise awareness of that imperative. Looking beyond the impact of jet fuel, we continue to partner with airports to 
adopt electrified ground-service equipment (GSE) as well as improving energy efficiency in our buildings. 
SAF and novel propulsion technologies are medium-to long-term  strategies to reach our climate goals. SAF is a proven alternative that offers great potential to reduce emissions 
from flying, on a lifecycle basis. We are working together with corporate customers, SAF producers, NGOs and industry groups to accelerate innovation and advance the supply and 
commercial viability of the SAF market in the next 10 to 15 years. As electric or hybrid-electric aircrafts may be viable for regional operations by 2040, we are investing in partnerships 
that help test, prove and advance these technologies.  
Additional information on our initiatives to pursue climate opportunities can be found in our 2020 LIFT report, in this report on our 2021 progress, and in our 2021 CDP report..

a) Identifying and Assessing Climate 
Related Risks 
b) Processes for Managing Climate 
Related Risks Climate-related risks are called out in our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. Through the ERM process, which is owned by Air Group’s internal audit program team, executive leaders are 
responsible for identifying, prioritizing and managing risks. Each quarter, the audit team meets with leaders to track these risks and integrate them into the ERM. This integration process includes 
understanding and updating the potential impact of the risks, analyzing the trend and escalation factors of the risks, evaluating the mitigation strategy, and monitoring metrics and KPIs of the risks. Through 
this process, climate-related risks have been categorized as a strategic risk. A synthetized risk report is presented to the board quarterly. 
Additionally, we manage the environmental regulatory risks through our environmental compliance program which reports periodically to the Safety Committee of the Board. Finally, with ESG including our 
path to net zero defined as a key strategy under the company’s 2025 strategic plan, progress is reviewed annually, the strategy refined and updates shared with the board as part of the core business cycle. 
c) Organizational Integration of Risk 
Management Practices The SVP of Public Affairs and Sustainability has responsibility for tracking and managing performance to metrics and targets in partnership with partners across the company and ensuring that understanding 
of climate risk informs our business strategy, mitigation and strategic plans. This work is in partnership with teams across the company and informed by engagement with a spectrum of stakeholders including 
employees, investors, government regulators, NGOs, reporting organizations, trade associations and others within and beyond the aviation industry.  
Due to the cross-functional nature of climate-related risks, responsibility for managing such risks is integrated into various business units. To name a few examples, our environmental affairs team manages 
climate-related compliance and regulatory risks alongside the real estate and airport development team. The real estate and airport development team is also responsible for managing climate-related risks to 
our facilities and critical systems. The supply chain team manages fuel-related risks. As detailed in the governance section, members from these teams are represented in the climate related working groups 
and provide regular input to the ESG Executive Steering to ensure organizational alignment and effective management.  AAG TCFD INDEX

GHG Emissions 
c) Targets used by the Organization to 
Manage Climate Related Risks In 2020, we published our short and long-term commitments to address our climate impact. These targets include:  
• Be the most fuel-efficient domestic airline 
• Achieve carbon neutral growth through 2025 
• Achieve net zero in our carbon footprint by 2040  
• Reduce GSE climate emissions by 50% 
To achieve these ambitious goals, we have integrated a carbon intensity metric in our all-employee performance-based pay plan. On an annual basis, we track and report an extensive list 
of energy and carbon metrics which include:    
• Scope 1 emissions from leased/owned aircraft, vehicles and facility heating 
• Scope 2 emissions from electricity consumption 
• Carbon intensity and aircraft energy intensity per seat and per passenger 
• Non-renewable aircraft fuel consumption 
• Non-renewable vehicle fuel consumption* 
• Sustainable aviation fuel consumption 
• Facility energy consumption* 
Our Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions and energy consumption data can be found on [p. 29-30 in this report], and for past years on page 18-19 in the 2020 lift report. We began disclosing 
our greenhouse gas emissions for the company in 2009. We are working towards calculating and ensuring internal awareness of our value-chain emissions (scope 3) with potential public 
disclosure to come in future years. 
*Energy consumption and vehicle fuel are tracked through Engie, which includes all paid through the Engie system but has some limitations for sources for which this is not the case. Data from leased facilities is also pulled and included. We are in process of 
building more complete data systems and these processes are subject to continuous improvement.
