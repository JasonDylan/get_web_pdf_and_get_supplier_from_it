“Dear Stakeholders:  
AIG is pleased to publish this 2021 Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) Report —  our second annual update detailing AIG’s journey to deliver excellence in everything we do —  including with respect to ESG and related initiatives.
The theme of our 2021 ESG Report is: Reimagining 
What AIG Can Do , which is the framework and 
a key component of our new Purpose & Values Statement. Reimagining What AIG Can Do  is at the 
core of what and how we deliver for our colleagues, clients, distribution partners, shareholders, communities and many other stakeholders. Most importantly, we are reimagining how to leverage AIG’s expertise and differentiators in ways that improve and sustain communities for generations to come.

Win Together 
AIG has delivered strong operational and 
financia
l performance by focusing on the power 
of working as a team. The same approach will 
drive our ESG strategy. While there is more work 
to be done, we have demonstrated that AIG is a 
company that can execute on multiple complex  
priorities under any conditions. 
Be an Ally Do What’s Right 
As a global risk management organization, we 
are consistently working with individuals and businesses to help them manage their most challenging risks. Just as we serve our external stakeholders, we also give our colleagues the tools they need to serve their communities and each other through Matching Grants Programs, paid Volunteer Time Off, the AIG Compassionate Colleagues Fund and other philanthropic programs designed to help our colleagues give back and do what’s right. 
Guided by AIG’s Purpose and Values, our ESG 
goals are clearly linked to our overall business strategy as we strive to be a top performing company and global market leader. 
This is the AIG we are reimagining for today and 
the future. 
Sincerely, 
Peter Zaffino Chairman & Chief Executive Officer American International Group, Inc. (AIG) 
4 to work at AIG and the behaviors required to drive change on our journey to become a top  
performing company. These Values are authentic  
to AIG — p rinciples that amplify our strengths 
and that can be integrated into day-to -day  
activities, attitudes and processes.
Our Values must be embedded in the collective 
decisions we make each day, and it is the consistency of those decisions and the actions  
we take that will allow us to dramatically reimagine  
what AIG can do for all our stakeholders. These  
Values are:
Take Ownership
AIG believes a transparent journey toward outlining our ESG goals is a requirement. Our  
2021 ESG Report marks the fourth consecutive  
year that we meet the TCFD standards on our  
ESG disclosures. Starting last year, we made our EEO-1 report fully available and have provided  
even more disclosure about our workforce in this  
year’s Report. Our high standard of transparency  
reinforces our commitment to take ownership  
when it comes to environmental standards, DEI goals  and governance.
Set the Standard
We recently made a commitment to achieve  
Net Zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our global underwriting and investment portfolios by 2050, or sooner. This new  
commitment complements our previously  
announced commitment to achieve Net Zero GHG emissions in our operations by 2050,  
or sooner.
In the Report, you will see many examples of how 
we serve as allies, particularly with respect to our colleagues. In addition, our commitment to g ender equity and gender pay equity has never 
been stronger. Our title sponsorship of the AIG Women’s Open, and the action we took in 2021,  
in partnership with The R&A, increased the purse and set a new benchmark for prize money in women’s golf — representing tangible proof of our  
belief that supporting women in business, sports,  
and society more broadly, is a critical component  
of our success.

5 I am honored to be part of AIG’s Executive 
Leadership Team in the newly created role of Executive Vice President, Global Head of  
Strategy & ESG —  which I assumed in February 
2022. Creating a leadership position that 
combines ESG and Strategy reflects the  
inextricably linked role that ESG will play in AIG’s success as we shape the company for  
the future. Our Chairman & CEO, Peter Zaffino,  
recognizes that each component of ESG is intrinsic to AIG’s business strategy and long-term growth.
Whether it is the magnitude of and uncertainty around the transition to a net zero carbon future, the measurable economic benefits of greater social inclusion in company results or the stronger reputations of companies with  
exceptional governance, ESG factors are critical to the financial outcomes of businesses and  
the socioeconomic outcomes of the societies in which they operate.

Chairman & CEO 
A Message From our EVP , Global 
Head of Strategy & ESG 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
PURPOSE AND VALUES OUR BUSINESS ESG STRATEGY SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS 
AND INNOVATION 
ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT The transition to a cleaner energy future is one 
of the greatest, if not the greatest, economic challenges of the 21st century. While it is easy to 
perceive the energy transition as a slow moving 
process, one where we have a long runway to find solutions, from an insurance perspective, the runway is getting shorter and the need for solutions is becoming more urgent. Without tackling the earth’s temperature rise and the associated increase in catastrophic risk, the world we live in will become increasingly less livable, and increasingly less insurable. Therefore, being part of the solution on climate change is vital to our strategy as a global insurer. 
As you read our 2021 Report, one key 
advancement from our inaugural report in 2020 is the increased level of transparency across 
all dimensions of ESG. 
• In the energy sphere, we have expanded 
the scope of our reporting to include broader 
third party emissions and by estimating 
emissions from our underwriting portfolio globally. From a sustainability perspective, this Report represents AIG’s second year 
of aligning with SASB and GRI guidelines, 
and fourth year of aligning with TCFD. • Within the DEI sphere, we highlight several new initiatives. AIG has made its EEO 1 
report, which details the composition of our workforce, fully available; we know that with disclosure comes accountability and we are taking ongoing steps to improve our metrics. In terms of gender representation, AIG 
recorded a 0.6 percentage point increase in 
female colleagues in 2021 to 54.7% across all employee categories globally. 
• Within the governance sphere, we believe reporting on net zero and social inclusion progress is embedded within good governance practices. AIG’s commitment to a transparent 
and accountable governance structure is 
something we believe promotes trust among our many stakeholders. 
At AIG, we are mindful of our important role in the industry. We understand that leading in the uncharted waters of the greatest energy 
transition in history is to lead in the face of many unknown factors, challenging us to bring to bear the expertise and skills that make AIG the 
global market leader that it is. We recognize there are risks, but also enormous rewards to being a catalyst for positive change. The enthusiasm from colleagues, clients, distribution partners, shareholders and other stakeholders has been a key contributor to AIG’s ESG journey and we thank you for partnering with us thus far. We look forward to ongoing engagement with you as, together, we reimagine what AIG can do for all our stakeholders.

ESG REPORT Executive Summary 
LEADERSHIP MESSAGES 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PURPOSE AND VALUES OUR BUSINESS AIG’s second ESG report builds upon our inaugural 
2020 ESG Report to provide a holistic view of AIG’s ESG efforts across our global business. We have expanded the scope of our reporting with a focus on climate action and human capital management. As our Chairman and CEO outlined in his letter, a cornerstone of our commitment to generating quality outcomes 
ESG STRATEGY 
necessitates sufficient focus on ESG, including our 
SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS culture. Our Executive Vice President, Global Head AND INNOVATION of Strategy & ESG has highlighted the increased 
ENVIRONMENTAL transparency of the current report. 
SOCIAL AIG will set the standard for how the risk management industry can successfully move into a future which 
GOVERNANCE 
contains greater risks, but also greater potential. We 
ABOUT THIS REPORT expect our ESG focus to evolve as we engage with key stakeholders and identify emerging ESG topics, trends, risks and opportunities; and as AIG evolves as a business. 
Environmental 
As a global risk management company playing a crucial role in finding viable pathways to a net zero future, it is essential for AIG and the clients we serve that we continuously adapt to and embrace the latest science and technology regarding pathways to a net zero future. We will achieve this by drawing upon our data and expert insights to create well-defined goals and by holding ourselves accountable as we pursue these objectives. 
In March 2022, we announced a commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
across our underwriting and investment portfolios by 2050, or sooner, which complements our existing 
commitment regarding our own operations. This report provides additional details about the actions associated with our net zero commitments and AIG’s use of science-based targets to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
Insurance is an essential part of the global economy because insurance allows households and businesses to take on more intelligent and informed risks. Understanding our role as an insurer and influencer of risk management practices, we have developed an ESG underwriting framework that defines our company-wide approach for consistently integrating ESG across all product lines. As such, we have implemented a dynamic and comprehensive methodology that informs how we approach and manage climate risk. 
We have also undertaken significant efforts, to 
support the market’s transition to a more sustainable and resilient economy by insuring renewable energy and lower-carbon industries. Recognizing that the energy transition will be a challenge, especially to less-resourced economies, AIG participates in the Sustainable Markets Initiative Insurance Taskforce. Our involvement included participation in the 
development of the Sustainable Products and Services Showcase to support green innovation across multiple sectors and geographies. Through these efforts, as well as our community-focused partnerships, we hope 
to lead the way in developing tools and frameworks that assess and address climate risk. 
Social 
The Social section of this report encompasses a broad range of efforts which demonstrate how AIG is contributing to building a more inclusive and sustainable economy that better serves the needs of all stakeholders. AIG embraces diversity, equity and inclusion in everything we do; from the way we uphold human rights, to how we attract, retain and develop our talent, to the support we provide our communities and the products and services we offer our clients. 
Our three career-development and diversity leadership 
programs, Accelerated Leadership Development Program, Executive Men’s Development Initiative and Women’s Executive Leadership Initiative, as well as our Early Career program, are avenues by which we are developing our pipeline of diverse senior leaders to advance at AIG.

Our Wellness at AIG program is aimed at destigmatizing mental health and providing our colleagues with resources to support their mental health. In 2021, AIG provided our global colleagues with two paid Wellness Days off to focus on their wellbeing. AIG is also committed to using our expertise in the arena of community engagement. In 2021, AIG contributed $27 million to nonprofit organizations 
through direct donations and matching grants, and colleagues volunteered more than 20,700 hours. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of AIG’s Volunteer Time Off Program, in 2022 AIG increased this benefit from 16 to 24 hours.

Governance 
AIG is committed to a robust set of effective governance policies and practices that are designed to set clear expectations and hold the company accountable to high standards of oversight, integrity and ethics while delivering long-term financial growth and value creation. 
Governance actions detailed in this report include our 
efforts to engage with government and regulatory officials to shape and understand evolving climate change policy frameworks, our continued advocacy for open, rules-based and sustainable trade through our Global Trade Series; and the incorporation of Culture of Integrity and Risk Management goals into annual performance goals for all managers. Governance is also an area where we work with our clients to ensure best practices, including cybersecurity and data privacy, which are essential to risk mitigation. 
This report reflects 2021 efforts and accomplishments by American International Group, Inc. (AIG) as a composite insurer, unless otherwise noted.

ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT The world is increasingly challenging our perspectives on risk. Moments of vulnerability feel more Our Business frequent, more substantial and more daunting than ever. The evolving future requires reimagining the 
ways we approach change. In a re-envisioned world, insurance is more than a way for clients to handle what can go wrong; it is also a catalyst for all that can go right. That is why AIG’s Purpose Statement is Discovering New Potential By Reimagining What AIG Can Do For You. 
General Insurance 
General Insurance is a leading provider of insurance products and services for 
commercial and personal insurance customers. It includes one of the world’s most far-reaching property-casualty networks. General Insurance offers a broad range of products to customers through a diversified, multichannel distribution network. Clients value our strong capital position and extensive risk management and claims experience, which position us as a market leader in critical lines of the insurance business. 
Many of our General Insurance clients face risks directly tied to ESG issues, such 
as climate risk and natural disasters. General Insurance draws upon technical underwriting expertise and risk analysis to provide a range of forward-thinking, ESG-related risk solutions for our clients. 
General Insurance product categories include Liability, Financial Lines, Property, 
Global Specialty, Crop Risk Services, Personal Lines and Accident & Health. Life & Retirement 
Life & Retirement is a unique franchise that brings together a broad portfolio of life insurance, retirement and institutional products offered through an extensive, multichannel distribution network. It holds long-standing, market-leading positions in many of the markets it serves in the U.S. With its strong 
capital position, customer-focused service, breadth of product expertise and deep distribution relationships across multiple channels, Life & Retirement is well positioned to serve growing market needs. 
Life & Retirement product categories include Individual Retirement, Group 
Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets. 
On October 26, 2020, AIG announced its intention to separate its Life & Retirement business from AIG. On November 2, 2021, AIG and Blackstone Inc. (Blackstone) completed the acquisition by Blackstone of a 9.9 percent 
equity stake in Corebridge Financial, Inc. (Corebridge), formerly known as SAFG Retirement Services, Inc., which is the holding company for AIG’s Life and Retirement business. As part of the separation, most of AIG’s investment operations were transferred to Corebridge or its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021. 
While AIG currently believes an initial public offering is the next step in the separation of the Life & Retirement business from AIG, no assurance can be given regarding the form that future separation transactions may take or the specific terms or timing thereof, or that a separation will in fact occur. Any separation transaction will be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval by the AIG Board of Directors and receipt of regulatory approvals. 
Our future ESG reporting will reflect the structural changes described above.

ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT In 2021, AIG prioritized 10 ESG themes 
based on the results of our first materiality assessment, which was conducted in 2020. The materiality assessment identified ESG topics that are most critical to AIG’s ability to generate long-term value and affect how stakeholders make decisions. 
These 10 themes provided the basis for our 
ESG efforts in 2021 and are the foundation for this report. 
We expect our ESG focus to evolve as we engage 
with key stakeholders and identify emerging ESG 
topics, trends, risks and opportunities; and as we evolve as a business. 
In October 2020, AIG announced its intention to separate its Life & Retirement business from 
AIG and, in 2021, made decisive progress. AIG will

Insurance Providing Risk Expertise 
and Solutions 
AIG works in partnership with our clients to help 
them achieve successful outcomes. Our loss control engineering approach provides clients with unique insights that are driven by our global engineering experience. We work with our clients to develop a customized program designed to identify, mitigate and minimize or eliminate loss exposures. This includes carefully matching project phases and activities to engineers who have relevant sector-specific operational experience (e.g., Upstream Energy, Renewable Energy, Oil & Petrochemical, Power Generation & Utilities and Mining). 
A key part of our client relationships is our ability to help our clients better identify and solve for risks that can jeopardize their projects’ success. AIG’s Risk Engineering Team partners with our underwriting teams and clients to assess risk and create safer, healthier environments by providing technical guidance for risk-based decisions. The team’s risk assessments can encompass all areas of our clients’ operations, including property and product safety, environmental and transportation risks and cyber infrastructure and incident response readiness. 
AIG can also harness the expertise of more specialized teams to help clients address specific risk challenges. For example, AIG’s Wildfire Protection Unit is a special risk management resource comprised of trained wildland firefighting professionals. These professionals meet with as many as 2,600 clients each year who have homes in wildfire-prone areas of California, Colorado and Texas. The unit educates our clients on meaningful preventative actions they can take to reduce fire-related risks, including implementing fire resistant landscaping and installing ember-resistant vents. The Wildfire Protection Unit monitors U.S. wildfire activity and, when possible, assists and helps to protect clients facing direct fire threats. These preparations range from moving combustible materials like firewood or debris away from the home or, in extreme cases, applying fire retardant to the exterior of the structure.

AIG’s ESG Ratings 
AIG Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) has developed proprietary industry-level ESG risk ratings for the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes to provide a holistic view of risk that transverses all types of insurance business written and assets held by AIG. 
These industries are scored based on an evaluation of ESG performance, trend analysis and ESG reputation of each industry. 
These ratings are then used as an input in 
the ESG underwriting framework screening process and are also an important input to climate risk plans, as they aid in the application of disciplined risk parameters, identify high-risk lines of business, support responding to regulatory requirements, guide stress testing and provide a link between liabilities and investments.

SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Supporting the Energy Transition 
The global economy is expected to transition to zero 
carbon by the second half of this century. We believe that the promotion of diverse energy portfolios is critical to ensuring companies are prepared to complete this transition. 
AIG’s holistic approach to the energy transition 
encompasses all the disciplines we serve, including power generation, upstream/oil rig, mining, oil & petrochemical, renewables and more. 
Our efforts to support the energy 
transition focus on evaluating emerging technologies and their risks, exploring stranded assets potential, discovering opportunities for growth and new products and understanding environmental considerations, policy and regulations to better determine how to address risks, loss trends and growth potential. 
Our energy transition work brings together AIG’s 
multi-disciplinary resources to service our clients as they move forward in their transition pathways. We have created a central hub for workflow, communication, client-facing relations and one-stop shop access to AIG service offerings in underwriting, 
risk engineering and claims across all lines of business. This centralization helps us develop risk review processes for renewable energy projects and emerging technologies — such as carbon capture and storage, battery storage and hydrogen — that are consistent 
across our lines of business. This allows us to reduce risk, improve underwriting fundamentals and establish standardized reporting, including reporting of key performance indicators.

Renewable Energy
Renewable energy sources will play a significant role in 
decarbonizing the electricity generation sector. Per the International Energy Agency (IEA) 2020 Roadmap to Net Zero Report, wind and solar electricity generation is expected to triple by 2030 and increase more than eightfold by 2050. This means that electricity generation from renewable sources is expected to increase from 29% in 2020 to over 60% in 2030 and to almost 90% by 2050, which indicates rapid growth for the renewable energy sector.
AIG recognizes that without insurance, the appetite 
for taking risks in a new or unproven sector would be dramatically reduced. 
AIG offers innovative solutions from 
beginning to end for these emerging technologies that allow for growth while providing the coverage needed to support the technology and provide security to our clients.
Our role as an insurer of renewable energy and  
lower-carbon industries helps support the overall market transition to a more sustainable and resilient economy.AIG strives to be a market leader in the support of renewable energy projects, including offshore and onshore wind, solar, hydro, battery storage, carbon capture and storage and other renewable energy operations. AIG offers multi-line coverage options and risk engineering expertise. 
In 2021, AIG wrote almost $400
1 million of business 
with renewable industries based on North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, representing an approximate 20% increase since 2019.

Community Resilience 
Community resilience is one of our ESG priorities. 
Through our partnerships with external organizations, we are supporting the development of resiliency frameworks, tools and research. 
Resilient Solutions Initiative 
In 2015, AIG and Wood, a leading global engineering firm, formed the Resilience Solutions Initiative to reduce carbon usage and increase resiliency against climate-related risks. In 2021, we expanded the partnership to include the Institute for Future Cities (IFC) at the University of Strathclyde. This partnership brings together three global leaders in insurance, finance, science, engineering, scenario planning and urban resilience to provide an end-to-end framework for our clients to identify, prioritize and implement low-carbon energy solutions and resilient infrastructure projects. 
The AIG-Wood-IFC Resilience and Sustainability 
Solutions Initiative has broken down the broad topic of climate change down into two addressable and intertwined workstreams: reducing carbon emissions and building resilience against the greater frequency and severity of natural disasters that occur as a result of climate change. The initiative leverages AIG’s capabilities to deliver innovative solutions for our clients and to advance sustainable urban development practices worldwide. 
In 2021, the partnership created a global network of six cities designed to promote knowledge transfer and urban resilience and to expedite the transition to net zero carbon emissions. The network is comprised of Glasgow, Lilongwe, Milan, Pittsburgh, Singapore and Surat. Throughout the year, the AIG-Wood-Strathclyde team hosted a number of workshops in these cities, including one during the official Pre-UN Climate Change Conference (COP) summit in Milan and a day-long workshop during the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP-26). The program is focused on translating the takeaways from prior engagements into an actionable “forward program” that can help the partners and cities achieve their resilience and sustainability objectives. 
The partnership also hosted a business roundtable 
at United Nations Industrial Development Organizations (UNIDO) 2021 Bridge for Cities event that focused on connecting cities that shared a pursuit of climate goals. Featuring remarks from UNIDO Deputy to the Director General Hiroshi Kuniyoshi, this event fostered a discussion regarding the vital role successful partnerships will play in achieving climate-related objectives. 
Geneva Association 
AIG is a member of the Geneva Association’s Climate Change & Environment (CCE) working group as well as a member of a new advisory committee that will launch in 2022 and focus on a resilient net zero transition. As members of the CCE working group, AIG experts participated in the development of the Task Force on Climate Risk Assessment’s final report, which aims to foster stronger multi-sectoral collaborations to address climate change. The report will guide insurance companies on how to include climate risk assessment in decision-making processes and what information should be disclosed to regulatory bodies and rating agencies.

Modelling Alliance 
AIG has been active in the IDF for many years, helping 
to shape the strategy and focus of the IDF’s efforts to increase resilience in the world’s most prone and vulnerable communities. As part of its membership with the IDF, AIG committed both financial and intellectual resources to aid in developing the Global Risk Modelling Alliance. This alliance of expert risk analysts aims to develop an open risk modeling platform available to all vulnerable communities and provide the technical support these communities need to manage natural disaster exposure proactively, rather than reactively. The Alliance builds capability by 
working side-by-side with local specialists to develop defined risk management programs and delivers their expertise through three main components: 1) an open risk modeling platform, 2) models and data for public good and 3) technical assistance service. To initiate this program, the IDF announced at COP26 a partnership with the V20, a group of 55 finance ministers from vulnerable countries, and has received an €11 million commitment from the German government to further the initiative.

Wellness and Security 
Enabling financial wellness and security is a key goal 
for AIG Life & Retirement and the clients we serve. AIG’s Group Retirement business offers various products, resources and information to assist our clients with their own financial planning. These include: 
• Financial professionals who guide retirement plan 
participants on financial wellness, longevity planning and retirement readiness. 
• A financial literacy and education curriculum that includes live and on-demand webinars and in-person workshops. 
• FutureFIT University, an interactive resource powered by EVERFI, which enables customers to build tailored financial literacy content. 
• Financial planning calculators and other online tools and resources. AIG Retirement Services was named among the Top 10 firms for participant satisfaction with websites and online capabilities in a 2021 study by Cogent Syndicated. 
• National education campaigns and engagement programs that reach tens of thousands of clients to help drive savings, education and action. For example, during the 2021 America Saves Week, 27% of engaged retirement plan participants enrolled, completed registration or increased their plan contributions. 
In 2021, we enhanced our offering to make it easier for clients to understand their retirement options and plan for a more secure financial future. For example, we simplified the user interface of our online retirement management platform, improved the mobile experience and added security features and information resources. For employers, we developed a retirement plan health dashboard that enables retirement plan sponsors to track the progress and impact that their organization’s retirement plan is having on their employees’ financial planning.

SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Increasing Financial Literacy 
through Award-Winning Client Education Programs 
AIG’s Individual Retirement business is committed to 
enhancing financial literacy through client education. Our education programs seek to simplify complex financial planning concepts, such as retirement income planning and Social Security planning, to help Americans better prepare for more secure financial futures. 
In 2021, our Social Security Savvy program garnered 
two MarCom Gold Awards, and our Income Savvy® program garnered a MarCom Gold Award and a MarCom Platinum Award from the Association of Marketing and Communications Professionals. Further, our Financial Know How for Women program, which was specifically designed to help address the financial planning concerns many women face when preparing for retirement, received a MarCom Gold Award. Individual Retirement also received the DALBAR award for Customer Experience Excellence for the third year in a row, underscoring its consistent commitment to providing a superior standard of care. 
As part of our commitment to promoting financial 
security and resilience more broadly, we also partner with the Foundation for Financial Planning to provide pro bono financial planning to at-risk Americans, e.g., cancer patients, military veterans, victims of natural disasters, domestic violence survivors, financially vulnerable seniors and frontline healthcare workers. Financial Security through 
Protected Lifetime Income 
With fewer people covered by traditional pension 
plans, annuities can fill a gap in retirement portfolios by providing protected lifetime income for as long as a person lives, no matter how the markets perform. AIG Life & Retirement offers a broad range of annuity products and solutions to help address specific client needs, goals and risk tolerance levels. We also support our diversified network of distribution partners with innovative tools and resources, including Client Connections from AIG®, a one-stop digital resource for enhancing their connections with clients. 
AIG Life & Retirement is a founding board member 
of the Alliance for Lifetime Income, a nonprofit educational organization that creates awareness and educates Americans about the value and importance of annuities and protected lifetime income in retirement. As part of its Protected Lifetime Income Study, the Alliance for Lifetime Income found that the number of protected households — i.e., those with an annuity 
or pension to supplement what they will receive from Social Security — had increased three percentage 
points to 40%. This represents over three million new protected households. The study attributed the rise to the increase in annuity ownership. 
Managing Longevity Risk 
By 2030, one in every five U.S. residents will be retirement age (65+). With an aging population comes an increasing need to manage longevity risk — the 
healthcare, long-term care and lifetime financial planning challenges that come with advanced age. In the U.S., AIG Life & Retirement offers life insurance products with accelerated death benefits that can be used to cover financial needs during policyholders’ later retirement years. AIG Life & Retirement also offers chronic, critical and terminal illness benefits that allow policy owners to tap into their death benefits to pay for certain covered medical costs or long-term care expenses. 
Protecting Senior Citizens 
from Elder Financial Abuse 
To help prevent elder financial abuse, AIG Life & 
Retirement formed the Elder and Vulnerable Client Care Unit, which raises awareness around elder financial exploitation and trains our employees to identify suspected cases of financial abuse. The need is clear: since its creation in 2016, the group has reviewed thousands of potential elder financial abuse cases, with the number of such cases increasing by about 30% per year. 
Alleviating the Financial Stress 
of Student Loan Debt 
To help reduce the long-term impact that student 
loan debt can have on financial wellness, AIG Group Retirement works with Savi, a social impact technology firm, to provide individuals working in the nonprofit and public service sectors with an online tool to help navigate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. At the end of 2021, the tool had more than 7,000 registered accounts managing over $100 million in total debt, with $40 million in projected forgiveness.

Providing Telehealth Support in the UK 
Recognizing the need for immediate, high-quality 
medical and well-being support around the clock, AIG Life Limited, our life insurance arm based in the UK, offers customers and their families 24/7 telehealth support, including mental health consultations. Delivered through a partnership with global telehealth provider Teladoc Health, our remote healthcare service supported a growing number of people during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is evidenced by the fact that this program by AIG, Smart Health, was used more than 22,000 times in 2021, double the usage in 2020, and included notable growth in the area of mental health. 
In 2021, AIG Life Limited enhanced its underwriting to 
make it quicker and easier for people who may have suffered with poor mental health to buy protection insurance. The improved terms mean that nine in 10 customers declaring a common mental health condition will be given an immediate “yes” or “no” decision, and we explain our decision to those people we cannot insure. The underwriting language is also simpler and more customer-friendly. 
Improving Coverage For Critical Illnesses 
In 2021, AIG Life Limited rolled out product innovations in the UK to provide simpler, fairer and broader coverage for critical illnesses. By consolidating serious medical conditions under grouped headings that focus 
on specific surgeries or the impact on a person’s daily life, not the name of the illness, we have enhanced the prospect of a successful claim if a plan participant or family member suffers a serious illness. The Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) Trust, which represents over 3,000 people living with multiple system atrophy in the UK, welcomed AIG Life’s approach to leveling the playing field for all degenerative neurological disorders: “A move away from an arbitrary list of conditions is a much fairer system for people, and more insurers should be thinking as AIG has, ” said Karen Walker, Chief Executive of the MSA Trust. “This innovative approach will give many more people the confidence that if they have a rare and terminal progressive neurological condition, like multiple system atrophy, they will in future be able to claim on their critical illness insurance. ” The product innovations received 2021 Financial Services Forum Awards for “Best Innovation to an Existing Product or Service” and “Best Overall Disruption Innovation. ” 
Enhancing Health and Well-Being 
in Ireland 
Laya Healthcare, which became part of AIG in 2015, 
provides private medical insurance to over 640,000 members in Ireland, providing some of the most innovative health insurance benefits and services in the Irish health insurance market. Its brand promise, Looking After You Always, represents Laya Healthcare’s member-centric approach, which is fundamental to its vision and values. Laya Healthcare’s vision is to empower its members to look after their health and well-being so they can be at their very best, always, with a key focus on preventative care and early detection of diseases. 
According to Laya Healthcare’s research, one in two 
(50%) people in Ireland put off vital health checks due to fear, concerns around cost and a lack of awareness around access. In response, Laya Healthcare has stepped up to address the barriers to health screening and put in place a series of benefits and initiatives to make it easier for members to access the right healthcare, in the right place and at the right time. 
Key initiatives during COVID-19 included providing 
unlimited access for members to the most in-demand digital healthcare services including consultations with general practitioners, nurses, physical therapists and well-being experts, provided at no additional cost to a member’s cover. Another major initiative is Laya Super Troopers, a free health homework program that encourages schoolchildren and their families to enjoy a healthier, more balanced lifestyle by focusing on three pillars: nutrition, physical activity and mental well-being. Since Laya launched the program in 2014, it has grown to be the largest program in Irish primary schools, with more than one million children participating in the program.

Sustainable Investing For several decades, AIG Investments’ municipal 
bond team has been investing in bonds that finance improvements to public drinking water supplies and water treatment infrastructure; the maintenance, expansion and energy efficiency of public transportation; access to affordable housing; access to public education and public healthcare and projects that improve energy efficiency and grid connectivity and increase the use of renewable energy. 
Additionally, AIG Investments’ private 
infrastructure debt team has been a leading investor in renewable and green energy projects for more than 35 years. The team has 
developed an expertise in analyzing these types of projects and recognizing the long-term value benefits and societal preferences for renewable and green energy alternatives. As of November 30, 2021
1, AIG had a total of $3.5 
billion invested in private wind, solar, geothermal and hydroelectric generation and transmission projects, solar power purchase agreements (PPAs) and commercial and residential PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy Program) loans (see Table 1). In 2021, AIG invested in a number of solar and alternative energy projects, including: 
$120 million in a portfolio of 446 distributed-generation and utility-scale assets across 23 states, including California, $1 20M New Jersey and the New England region. The portfolio operates 446 MW of gross capacity, which is enough electricity 
to power over 73,000 homes. Distributed solar power generation provides solar energy resources by installing generation tools and technologies in proximity to the end users of the power. For example, a solar power generation system can be installed on rooftops of houses and commercial buildings that will then use the energy. 
$160 million in a pair of wind farms in Norway, including one of the largest wind power parks in the region. 
ENVIRONMENTAL $160M The wind farms operated a combined 2,146 MW of gross capacity, which can power over 105,000 homes. Norway, 
SOCIAL Denmark and Sweden source a significant amount of energy from renewable resources, which has allowed for the

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Prior to establishing net zero commitments, AIG 
wanted to ascertain its carbon exposure baseline. In 2021, we completed a carbon exposure assessment 
of our General Insurance underwriting and investment portfolios to understand our current state and guide our climate strategy, including our recent net zero commitments. 
To measure our overall carbon exposure, we engaged a third-party consultancy to help us estimate absolute and intensity emissions
1 within our underwriting 
and investment portfolios and our operations, and to develop a roadmap of the action steps that must be taken to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050, or sooner. 
To conduct this analysis, we used the latest climate data 
science, standards and frameworks available. Graph 2 at right shows AIG’s estimated emissions. This is based on data availability and existing methodologies. As the standards and frameworks continue to evolve and more complete data becomes available, the estimations may change. This analysis does not include Life & Retirement’s underwriting or investment portfolios given the expected separation of this business from AIG. 
1. Absolute refers to the total quantity of greenhouse gas emissions 
being emitted, whereas intensity compares the amount of emissions to some unit of economic output. The emissions of companies that AIG underwrites and AIG intends to reduce its emissions by setting and 
invests in make up most of our estimated emissions, pursuing science-based targets. Remaining emissions 
while AIG’s own operations represent approximately that cannot be reduced will be neutralized with high-
1% of the total. quality offsets.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Underwriting 
AIG is currently one of the first insurance companies 
to have estimated emissions of its underwriting portfolio using the CRO Forum’s Carbon footprinting methodology for underwriting portfolios
6, the only 
guidance available for the insurance sector. These estimates allowed us to identify high-emitting sectors in our operations. 
82% of AIG’s estimated emissions from its underwriting 
General Insurance business are attributed to Utilities, Manufacturing, Mining, Quarrying and Oil & Gas Extraction, Management of Companies and Enterprises, Transportation and Warehousing. The remaining 18% is distributed across 15 other sectors including finance and insurance, wholesale and retail trade, professional services, agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, real estate, construction, hospitality, public administration. 
In 2021, AIG held ESG roundtables with several of 
our clients across multiple regions to facilitate open dialogue about ESG priorities and journeys. AIG intends to continue our efforts to engage more closely with our clients, particularly those in high-emitting sectors, to understand their transition pathways and provide solutions that incentivize and enable them to reduce their own emissions. 
In 2021, AIG also designed an ESG underwriting 
framework for its General Insurance business. This framework is currently being piloted across business lines and regions for testing and refinement. You can read more in the Sustainable Solutions & Innovation section of this report.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Path to Net Zero 
To meet our net zero commitments, we will continue 
to measure our emissions annually and will use these measurements to set science-based targets. Our multi-pronged approach to reaching net zero focuses on four levers: 
1 Integration — Promoting preparedness through 
disciplined underwriting and investment excellence, including the explicit, systematic and comprehensive integration of ESG into our business practices 
2 Engagement — Engaging with our clients, 
suppliers, investees and other stakeholders to understand their decarbonization pathways, collaborating to find solutions and partnering to develop more sustainable business practices 
3 Innovation — Capitalizing on the latest 
technology and innovation by using enhanced data and analytics capabilities, leveraging our risk expertise and supporting and investing in new solutions that advance net zero progress 
4 Stewardship — Leading by example in our 
operations and helping to shape the standards for net zero pathways AIG continues to have a seat at the table and 
take a leading role in shaping the outcome of industry standards, regulations and transformational products. 
Through our partnerships with net zero-focused 
alliances, such as the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) Insurance Taskforce, AIG continues to have a seat at the table and take a leading role in shaping the outcome of industry standards, regulations and transformational products. We are involved in SMI’s workstream, which focuses on developing an approach to measuring the carbon footprint across underwriting portfolios and establishing a framework to track the global insurance industry’s ability to support the transition towards net zero across multiple industries and geographies. This workstream partners with Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and the UN-convened Net Zero Insurance Alliance. You can read more about our partnerships in the Sustainable Solutions & Innovation section of this report. 
“We will work together with our clients and distribution partners, 
in particular, to ensure an ongoing transition to a net zero future and provide guidance on feasible solutions designed to help manage climate-related risks.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Types of 
Climate Risk AIG considers the potential impact from 
climate-related issues on our business, strategy and financial planning over short-, medium- and long-term time horizons. We consider both direct physical impacts and indirect effects that may emerge through transition risks, particularly those driven by new legal and regulatory requirements. We also consider evolving investor, client and 
broker expectations. 
In the short term, acute physical risks from climate 
change may result in increased frequency and severity of natural catastrophes. This in turn affects operational risks associated with business activities of AIG or third parties as well as business continuity risks. We manage these physical and operational risks through our modeling work, the diversification of our business and regular reviews of our risk appetite and reinsurance strategy. 
 In the short- to medium-term, AIG’s underwriting and investment activities create potential legal and regulatory risks due to increased focus on ESG-related litigation and regulatory action. In the medium- to long-term, chronic physical risks such as shifting temperatures, precipitation levels, droughts and sea water levels could impact AIG’s property and casualty underwriting and operational exposures to climate change. Morbidity and mortality expectations could also be affected by dramatic changes in weather, including the potential spread of vector-borne diseases. Additionally, efforts to transition towards low or net zero carbon economies present market and credit risks. Further, AIG’s attempts to match long-duration liabilities from AIG Life and Retirement with equally long-dated assets may present technology risks.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Natural 
Catastrophe Risk 
We manage catastrophe exposure with multiple 
approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both 
the traditional reinsurance and capital markets 
in addition to other reinsurance protections. 
We use third-party catastrophe risk models and 
other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency 
and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply 
adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks. 
We perform post-catastrophe event studies 
to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, 
and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned 
from post catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies 
exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period. 
We recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change. 
For an overview of our natural catastrophe exposures and annual aggregate modeled losses for all perils worldwide refer to our 2021 Form 10-K page 165–167 .

Business Continuity Risk 
AIG has business continuity plans in place to help 
ensure we can quickly respond to climate change-related incidents that may disrupt business operations, including extreme weather events. AIG regularly reviews its existing incident management, business continuity and disaster recovery practices, and our Global Head of Resiliency guides our business resiliency plans. 
In 2021, AIG successfully put these incident 
management and business continuity plans into action in moments of crisis. For example, our Houston offices were significantly impacted by Winter Storm Uri and our New Orleans, Baton Rouge and New York offices were affected by Hurricane Ida. In both cases, we experienced power outages and had to suspend essential on-site functions. However, pursuant to our business continuity plans, our employees received emergency communications via AIG’s Alert system to allow them to confirm their safety and ability to work, and we were able to continue operating remotely. These events gave us the opportunity to assess, enhance and improve our operational resiliency. 
In December 2019, AIG began tracking the emergence of COVID-19, and after it developed into a pandemic in 2020, we successfully implemented business continuity plans, including transitioning over 90% of our workforce to a remote work environment, thereby response strategy prioritizes the health and safety of our employees, and we continue to adjust our approach as conditions evolve.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Regulatory Risk 
Regulators are increasingly focused on ESG issues, 
including climate change issues. Per the UN Green Finance Platform, there are over 680 unique climate-related policy measures in place globally, and there were over 1,000 sustainable finance or ESG regulatory developments in 2021 alone. Governments and policymakers are pledging to meet carbon reduction targets and are adopting sustainable finance strategies that decarbonize their economies to drive adaptation and resiliency in the face of increasing natural catastrophes and societal pressures. As such, we anticipate that policymakers and regulators’ climate- and ESG-related expectations will continue to increase over the coming years. 
To better understand the scale of the political and 
regulatory environment in this area, AIG regularly assesses the current and pending climate and ESG-related regulatory developments that may impact AIG. 
What follows are some examples of AIG’s responses to 
the evolving regulatory landscape. 
United Kingdom 
The UK regulators have been in the vanguard of climate stress testing. 2021 saw the second climate stress test from the Bank of 
England, known as CBES: Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario, which built upon the original exercise in 2019. AIG UK was invited to participate as one of the largest insurers in the UK. The aim of the exercise was to size potential climate change risks and assess the impact of a range of potential actions that could be taken in response to the risks. CBES included multiple scenarios covering climate as well as macro-economic variables, with a time horizon of up to 30 years. Insurers were asked to consider the physical impacts from more severe climate events, the impact on the investment portfolio and a series of hypothetical litigation scenarios. The quantitative results were supported by a detailed qualitative questionnaire. From the different elements of CBES, the hypothetical climate litigation scenarios presented the largest financial impacts for AIG UK. This was as expected since AIG is a very significant insurer in Casualty and Financial lines. 
The impact on the investment portfolio was less 
significant for AIG UK, given the conservative investment portfolio, although some losses were seen driven by higher credit spreads and interest rates assumed under all three scenarios. The greatest impact arose, unsurprisingly, where no additional government policy actions were taken to respond to climate-related risks. 
The physical impact was relatively modest for AIG UK 
owing to the nature of risk in its property underwriting, and again the no additional government policy action scenario delivered the largest impacts from climate-related risks.

As of 2021, climate change risk is embedded 
within the Risk Appetite Statement of 
AIG Europe SA (AESA). AESA management has also developed a climate change risk integration plan. 
Singapore 
AIG Singapore is testing the ESG underwriting framework and has developed 
the climate risk appetite and the climate variability scenario within the 2021 ORSA report, which has been approved by its Board of Directors. The responsibilities of the Board and management have also been updated to outline oversight of environmental risk. AIG Singapore continues to actively engage with and provide feedback to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, such as embedding environmental risk assessments into investment decisions and underwriting processes. 
Australia 
AIG Australia assigned the responsibility for the identification and management of financial risks from climate change to the 
ERM team, managed by the AIG Australia CRO. 
In December 2021, the Board Risk Committee 
approved a climate risk plan that details how climate risk management will be embedded into business processes, with heavy focus on the Australia underwriting and investments portfolio. 
In 2021, AIG Australia also included climate risk in its 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), 
Risk Appetite Statement and Risk Management Strategy. AIG Australia also included climate-related stress testing in the 2021 ICAAP in the form of a climate stress plan, which will be executed starting in 2022. Key features of the 2021 climate stress plan include climate scenarios pertaining to physical, transition and liability climate risk elements. 
Upcoming Regulatory Requirements 
AIG monitors for and tracks regulatory developments across all jurisdictions in which we operate. AIG’s International Sustainability Working Group is providing support to AIG’s international businesses to advance sustainability initiatives and address regulatory requirements on a consistent basis across the company. Additionally, AIG is actively participating in industry associations and coalitions that are focused on ESG topics to provide our point of view and shape developing standards and requirements.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Investment 
and Credit Risk 
AIG embeds ESG considerations in its fundamental 
investment analysis of the companies or projects we invest in to ensure that they have sustainable earnings over the full term of our investment, as material, relevant and available. AIG considers internal and external factors and evaluates changes in consumer behavior, industry trends related to ESG factors and the ability of the management companies to respond appropriately to these changes to maintain their competitive advantage. 
AIG is a diversified company that takes on both short- 
and long-term liabilities from policyholders. To the fullest extent practicable, AIG seeks to duration-match its assets to its liabilities. As such, we seek out long-term investments to match our long-term liabilities with a long-term perspective about the return profile and sustainability of the investments. 
Our portfolio broadly consists of fixed income, asset-
backed and securitized products and alternatives, including listed and private equity. Some of these investments are either secured by, or heavily dependent on, physical assets. Although our credit and investment processes consider protections that are in place, such as property and business interruption insurance, increased physical and transition risks from climate change may affect the value of these assets in the future. 
As efforts to move away from a carbon-intensive economy gather pace, financial market participants may fundamentally reassess the value of carbon-intensive assets and the businesses that rely on them. Shifts in consumer behavior may affect the long-term viability of these businesses and, in turn, the value of the liabilities that they issue. This revaluation may lead to asset impairments. Accordingly, we attempt to consider the relevant and material factors, including climate and ESG, as part of our initial investment underwriting process. As part of a group-wide effort to prioritize and engage subject matter experts on climate-related risks, AIG’s Credit Risk Team held several special topic discussions throughout 2021 about how different transition scenarios could impact the asset performance of AIG’s metals and mining, energy, automotive and real estate sector exposures. Moreover, Credit Risk regularly engages the first line on climate-related risk considerations during reviews of above-threshold obligors and annual portfolio reviews with AIG’s Investments and Credit Lines business units.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Litigation 
and Legal Risk 
Litigation related to climate change has increased in 
recent years. Many lawsuits center on enforcement or interpretation of environmental laws and regulations, often seeking to use litigation as a tool to influence government and corporate climate policies. Other cases seek damages for alleged contributions to climate change, insufficient disclosure around material financial risks or “greenwashing” false advertising claims. Additionally, even where climate change is not the subject of a lawsuit, it can still create circumstances that give rise to or substantially impact the magnitude of litigation. 
Some of this recent litigation includes lawsuits brought 
by municipalities throughout the U.S. against fossil fuel companies that seek to hold the companies accountable for past, present and future costs allegedly arising from climate change. While such cases have been unsuccessful thus far, AIG tracks the underlying cases and factors that can change their risk profile. These factors include scientific developments that claim to tie climate-related harms to individual companies and legal developments such as giving personhood and legal 
rights to natural objects or ecosystems. 
Securities actions are another form of direct litigation 
over climate change. These include shareholder securities suits against companies, directors and officers, as well as derivative actions brought against directors for alleged disclosure or climate risk management failures. While these kinds of actions have not resulted in material losses, AIG continues to assess the evolving norms for disclosure and expectations for corporate action around climate change, which create the potential for more climate-related litigation. 
AIG also considers and monitors the indirect effects of 
climate risk on litigation, which have already resulted in losses. Severe weather and other effects of climate change result in more frequent and more severe damages, leading to lawsuits. For example, wildfires in the western U.S. created significant litigation liability for utility companies whose actions allegedly affected the fires. Litigation about injury or damage 
from flooding, mudslides and other severe weather as well as litigation about construction defects, chemical release and workers compensation are all indirectly affected by climate change. AIG regularly assesses how climate change indirectly affects claim frequency and severity and engages in discussions among business units to ensure we are understanding and addressing these trends. 
Reputational Risk 
Investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders are placing greater scrutiny on climate-related topics, and expectations about how businesses should respond to climate issues are evolving. Companies that are unable to meet stakeholders’ expectations could suffer from negative publicity, reputational harm or loss of customer or investor confidence, which could adversely affect operations. 
AIG is committed to addressing reputational risk. For 
example, AIG Trade Finance has been requiring all clients and counterparties from the diamond industry to meet the highest sustainability standards and avoid so-called “blood diamonds, ” and we insist that diamantaires be active members of the Responsible Jewellery Council.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Technology Risk 
Technological advancements that support the 
transition to a lower-carbon, energy-efficient economic system may have a significant impact on a wide range of companies and other organizations. This may affect the nature and financial impact of the risks our customers seek to insure. This economic transition may also materially affect the demand for insurance in specific sectors, most obviously in energy and transport. Although this may not necessarily reduce the overall demand for insurance products and services, it may alter demand patterns and the nature of insurance cover required. 
AIG is currently addressing technology risks as part 
of our Energy Transition efforts. We have created cross-functional working groups that focus on specific technical topics, like hydrogen as well as carbon capture and storage. These working groups convene experts from engineering, underwriting, claims and other business lines to share lessons learned, discuss leading practices, raise questions and develop guidance for the business. Additionally, our ERM team has established a Community of Practice (CoP) to assess the potential impact of different types of energy transition risks, including technological advancements. The Energy Transition CoP brings together expertise and resources across business lines and functions where these risks are most likely to manifest and acts as the central location to review, evaluate and disseminate data and information to inform decision-making and goal setting. Through regular interactions and roundtable discussions with internal and external stakeholders, the Energy Transition CoP is developing a top-of-the-house view to guide AIG’s underwriting, investment and risk management processes. Importantly, this view will form a baseline for dedicated emerging risk professionals conducting materiality and impact assessments across all affected lines of business. 
Life & Retirement — Climate-Related Risks 
While our Life & Retirement business does face the climate risks mentioned in the previous section, it is also exposed to climate-related increases in 
mortality and morbidity risks. These risks are most significant for our life insurance products and can rise as the frequency and intensity of natural 
catastrophes associated with climate change increase. However, because our operations are dispersed across the U.S. rather than concentrated in areas with high frequencies of natural catastrophes, this impact is generally expected to be limited, and our loss experience suggests that we have not yet seen such a climate change-related increase. 
AIG also acknowledges the possibility of increased pandemic risk due to climate change, such as from vector-borne diseases. AIG has an emerging risk framework that seeks to understand the inherent risks associated with emerging diseases resulting from climate change, many of which would be addressed through collaboration with reinsurers and other carriers in the industry. AIG’s risk tolerance may be modified, as appropriate, based on the identified risk and its impact to our proposed insured segment. Strategies to effectively manage these inherent risks may include limiting amounts and issue age as well as limited acceptance of substandard risk.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Management of 
Climate-Related Risks AIG’s company-wide ERM function 
integrates each business unit’s risk management function so that senior management has a consolidated view of AIG’s key risks. This approach helps AIG embed risk management in our business processes and allows us to appropriately identify, assess, quantify, manage, monitor, report and mitigate AIG’s risk exposures. This includes risks related to changing climate conditions and societal changes that could impact operations and elevate reputational risks. Risk Appetite 
Framework 
Our Risk Appetite Framework integrates stakeholder 
interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. We balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. The framework includes our risk appetite statement approved by the Board of Directors and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources. 
We articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk 
tolerances and thresholds on capital and liquidity measures. These measures are set at the AIG Parent level as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. We must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our capital management and liquidity management policies. Our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations and business needs. An internal Group Risk Committee routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is also presented periodically to the Risk and Capital Committee of the AIG Board of Directors by our Chief Risk Officer.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Risk identification and measurement are key tools 
used to inform the Risk Appetite Framework. We identify risk through several processes at the business unit and corporate level, and we conduct an integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process at the product-line level. We also perform an annual top-down risk assessment to identify top risks and assign owners to address and manage these risks. 
AIG integrates climate risk into its company-wide 
Risk Appetite Statement and ORSA reports. Business functions are increasingly integrating climate risk into their activities, and business leads are considering how to address climate risk challenges in their strategic plans and track climate-related activities across the year. 
The Group Risk Committee (GRC), which is comprised 
of members of AIG’s Senior Management, is responsible for assessing significant risk issues on a global basis to protect AIG’s financial strength and reputation. The GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to established risk tolerances. Our Chief Risk Officer also periodically presents a consolidated risk report to the AIG Board of Directors’ Risk and Capital Committee. Emerging Risk Forum 
AIG has an Emerging Risk Forum to monitor, assess and analyze climate-related risks and other key emerging risks facing the company. The forum includes AIG subject matter experts from across many global geographies and functions. The Emerging Risk Forum conducts horizon scanning to facilitate cross-functional dialogue, improve information flow across the company, catalyze risk management action and spark product innovation. 
In 2021, AIG’s Emerging Risk Forum collectively 
identified risks associated with climate change as a priority, coordinating assessments of climate-related physical and transition risks. To better understand and define climate-related risks and opportunities, and more effectively direct expert insights and opinions to lines of business that could be possibly impacted, the Emerging Risk Forum established dedicated CoPs focused on Energy Transition Risk and Physical Climate Risk. The CoPs consist of subject matter experts from across different businesses and functional support areas. This approach complements AIG’s existing management of climate-related risks through natural catastrophe modeling, our reinsurance strategy, business continuity planning and regularly revisiting the organizational appetite for such risks. Biodiversity 
Healthy ecosystems and biodiversity are critically important to human health and underpin many economic activities. We are dependent on biodiversity for supplying food and clean water, developing medicines and pharmaceuticals, filtering pollution, storing CO2, mitigating the impact of storms and floods, regenerating soils and protecting against infectious disease. According to the World Economic Forum’s Nature Risk Rising Report, more than $44 trillion, or more than half of the world’s GDP , is highly or moderately dependent on nature. 
Although the full social impact of biodiversity loss is 
not yet clear, degradation of natural ecosystems can directly impact the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes like flooding, landslides and wildfires. Biodiversity loss may also harm human health in various ways, including increasing the threat of infectious diseases, which, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, can carry significant economic and business costs. 
AIG recognizes the importance of healthy biodiversity 
and the need to understand the many effects created by biodiversity loss. As such, we devote meaningful time 
and resources to better understanding and managing the risks related to biodiversity loss. The ERM team is monitoring the risks and effects of biodiversity loss throughout our business, and our Emerging Risk Forum holds quarterly briefings to increase education and awareness of biodiversity issues.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Operational 
Impact In early 2022, we expanded our net zero 
commitments to include reaching net zero GHG emissions in our underwriting and investment portfolios and we also committed to sourcing 100% Renewable Energy for our operations by 2030 or sooner and setting science-based emission reduction targets to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. This builds on our previous commitment of reducing our global operational (scope 1 and scope 2) emissions to net zero by 2050, or sooner. 
GHG Emissions 
AIG collects data on GHG emissions using an 
organizational boundary based on activities within our operational control. Where available, GHG emissions are calculated on the basis of actual (i.e., metered) data received. In certain instances where actual data is not available, GHG emissions are estimated using internationally accepted and recognized methodologies from The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard from the World Resource Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development. 
Since 2019, we have collected information from certain 
sources of emissions that are controlled or owned by AIG (scope 1 and scope 2 emissions) and from value chain activities not directly owned or controlled by AIG (scope 3 emissions). These include the following: 
• Scope 1 emissions:  sources from fuel combustion at 
facilities (e.g., boilers, heating, back-up generators) 
and from mobile sources (e.g., corporate air and ground fleet) 
• Scope 2 emissions: sources from the purchase 
of electricity 
• Scope 3 emissions: sources from business air travel 
In 2021, with the support of a third-party consultant, we were able to expand our collection of GHG emissions 
data and capture additional sources of emissions we were unable to measure and report in prior years (2019 and 2020). These additional sources include: 
• Scope 1 emissions: sources from refrigerants 
• Scope 2 emissions: sources from district heating 
• Scope 3 emissions:  sources associated with purchased 
goods and services
1, fuel- and energy-related activities 
not already included in scope 1 or 2 (e.g., transmission 
and distribution losses from the generation of electricity, steam, heating and cooling) and waste generated in operations and upstream leased assets 
Expanding our collection of GHG emissions data is an important step forward as we progress on our journey to net zero emissions by 2050, or sooner. To meet our net zero commitments, we will need to engage with our clients, suppliers and investees and other stakeholders to understand our decarbonization pathways, collaborate and partner to find and develop solutions.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT Table 2  includes AIG’s scope 3 emissions from value chain activities not directly controlled or owned by 
AIG. The increase in estimated emissions seen in 2021 is primarily due to improvements in data coverage, 
the inclusion of four additional scope 3 sources, as well as an increase in business air travel as restrictions 
associated with COVID-19 lessened.

In 2022, we will re-evaluate our emissions profile, including our baseline, which will likely reflect changes 
resulting from the anticipated separation of the Life & Retirement business from AIG. 
Non-financial information, such as GHG emissions, is subject to measurement and estimation uncertainties 
resulting from limitations inherent to the data and methods used for compiling and determining such information. The methodologies and assumptions used to determine such data are still in the early stages of development and are likely to change. As our measurement and estimation techniques evolve, the use of different methodologies and changes in data availability could result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. GHG emission calculations also depend on third-party information which AIG has no ability to verify independently.

We are in the final year of AIG 200, our multi-
year, enterprise-wide transformation program to position AIG for the future. The program focuses on transformational change across the company and is guided by four core objectives: 
1. Achieving underwriting excellence 
2. Modernizing operating infrastructure 
3. Enhancing user and customer experiences 
4. Becoming a more unified company 
As a result of AIG 200 initiatives, we have been 
able to make an impact on our operational GHG emissions through digitization, new ways of working, targeted procurement strategies and office space consolidation. Initiatives have included our shared services partnership and our cloud migration as part of our IT Modernization. New Business 
Travel Standard 
AIG’s updated Travel Standard focuses on cost 
savings as well as increasing efficiency and sustainability. AIG’s Meetings and Events Program will encourage the continued use of Virtual Meeting technology to avoid unnecessary travel-related emissions and costs associated with in-person meetings. Requiring executive leadership pre -
trip approval will support these efforts to avoid unnecessary trips, reduce travel volume and minimize travel emissions. Where in-person meetings are necessary, use of AIG’s preferred suppliers, through our designated online booking tool and Corporate Card Program, will allow our Travel team to work with suppliers who offer optimal total value, which includes quality, service, sustainability and diversity.

GOVERNANCE ABOUT THIS REPORT 30 Hudson — Office of the Future 
AIG’s Jersey City office is located at 30 Hudson Street, 
a LEED-, WELL- and Energy Star Certified Building. Its LEED Gold certification reflects significant office 
design upgrades to reduce its carbon footprint and promote employee health. 
• Location in a walkable community with easy access to public transportation 
• Reduction of water use through efficient systems and fixtures 
• Utilization of energy-efficient systems and renewable energy sources 
• Installation of interior building materials that promote healthy indoor air quality 
• Implementation of a comprehensive recycling program 
• Utilization of eco-friendly cleaning products and procedures 
• Installation of dispatch elevators to reduce wait and travel times and increase energy efficiency by reducing total number of elevator trips, stops and starts 
AIG’s workplace at 30 Hudson was designed to provide our colleagues with the freedom to decide where and how work gets done. Multiple working environments provide different settings that support both individual and collaborative work, including enclosed private offices and meeting rooms at the core of the building and unassigned, open seating throughout the rest of the floors. These naturally lit office spaces reduce 
the need for artificial lighting and promote employee health and productivity. 
Employees reserve the individual unassigned 
workspaces, which are outfitted with state-of-the-art monitors, ergonomic desk equipment and soundproof panels to ensure privacy. 
To support AIG’s commitment to supplier diversity, 
AIG’s real estate team worked with six different women-owned or minority-owned business enterprise suppliers to complete this $5.5M project.

Pathway to Paperless 
In 2021, AIG’s Life U.S. Operations organization 
embarked on a journey to enhance the customer experience and reduce paper usage, kicking off a series of multi-year project initiatives. These initiatives target both new business and in-force correspondence delivery to customers. These initiatives also focus on building out our consumer portal, which will launch in 2022. 
Our new consumer portal will not only improve 
customer experience, but also will reduce costs and the environmental impact associated with the printing and mailing of customer correspondence. This updated technology improves security measures, offers enhanced controls to combat fraud and is ADA compliant, ensuring we are catering to our customers’ needs. 
Portal adoption goals by 2024: 
50% call volume reduction 
(1.2M calls today) 25% paper billing reduction (30% of customers on eBill today) 
40% 
35% in-force paper correspondence reduction (12M pieces of outbound paper today) 
straight-through transaction increase, eliminating human involvement (15% STP today) 70% newly issued life policies electronically delivered (“eDelivered”) to customers (35% today)

Initiatives 
Horizon 2020 PROBONO 
PROBONO brings together a European multidisciplinary 
consortium of 47 partners, construction and consulting entities, public asset service managers, 
municipalities, technology solution providers and experts. This group is working to convert six European districts (PROBONO Living Labs) into Green Building Neighborhoods (GBNs) that will have positive energy balances and zero carbon emissions. The six proposed PROBONO Living Labs are in Madrid, Spain and Dublin, Ireland (both large-scale labs), as well as Porto, Portugal; Brussels, Belgium; Aarhus, Denmark and Prague, Czech Republic. 
AIG’s Brussels office is located within a proposed GBN zone. Through a partnership with a key UK client, AIG has committed to support the GBN proposal, become a member of the advisory board and adjust our building and related services to meet the GBN targets. Restaurant Associates 
(Compass UK & Ireland) 
AIG is transforming its services to support a sustainable 
food system with Compass Group UK & Ireland, AIG UK’s catering and hospitality provider. Compass Group 
UK&I has committed to reach Climate Net Zero by 2030 across their operations and value chain, covering scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. 
AIG UK’s own emissions profile will benefit from 
Compass UK&I’s commitments through: 
• A 25% switch from animal to plant-based proteins 
by 2025 and a 40% switch by 2030 
• A regenerative agriculture sourcing target of 70% for fresh meat, dairy, fruit and vegetables by 2030 
• No air-freighted fruit and vegetables 
• 100% diversion of food waste from landfill 
• 100% reusable or recyclable packaging by 2023 Printing Commitment 
As part of AIG’s commitment to reach net zero 
emissions by 2050, there is a plan to reduce the number of printing devices to one per floor across our entire UK office network by 2023. The reduction will also support lowering data privacy risk through printing fewer documents. 
Our UK business operation, pre-pandemic, saw us 
collectively print 3.8 million pages per year. That is roughly the equivalent to felling around 458 trees to create about 19 tons of paper, a process which requires 213,000 kWh of electricity and 1.66 million litres of water. 
The pandemic’s impact on being able to print in the office has resulted in all figures being nearly halved. Our target now is to maintain those levels and over time, through digitisation, further reduce those levels of consumption. We are committed to 50% reduction in operational print by 2023 and 90% reduction by 2025 from 2019 levels.

Operation Healthy Air 
In 2021, AIG partnered with Earthwatch, an 
environmental non-profit, to host Operation Healthy Air, an employee engagement series around Earth Day focused on the science behind air pollution and global air quality. AIG colleagues around the globe joined the sessions to learn about the impacts of pollution on air quality and take part in air quality monitoring in their own neighborhoods. Employees used their smartphones to collect air quality data at home, which was analyzed and discussed by the Earthwatch scientists at the final program session. Operation Healthy Air educated employees about the impact of poor air quality on our health and global communities and provided useful resources on reducing pollution and exposure to unhealthy air. 
This Is The Last Straw Campaign 
As part of Global Volunteer Month and the lead up to Earth Day, AIG hosted the This is the Last Straw campaign, aimed at educating colleagues on the negative environmental impacts of plastic pollution and encouraging shifting habits around plastic consumption. Participating colleagues could calculate their plastic usage, pledge to reduce their personal plastic consumption and receive a reusable straw and tote bag to kick-start their commitment (U.S. only). AIG also shared helpful tips to reduce daily plastic consumption and encouraged colleagues to connect and share their own tips using the hashtag #ThisistheLastStraw on Yammer, AIG’s globally accessible internal forum.

Attracting, developing and retaining the best and brightest professionals is critical to our ability to deliver innovative, high-quality results as a global risk leader. 
Today’s professionals care about more than 
compensation. They value flexibility, diversity and genuine commitment to corporate social responsibility, along with future opportunities for career advancement. Our Global Talent strategy incorporates these increasingly important factors so that we can present compelling career opportunities to top professionals around the world and continue to build a team that consistently executes with excellence.

Attraction 
As the world continued to evolve and respond to the 
COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2021, the workforce also changed. Voluntary turnover approached pre-pandemic volumes, hovering around 11%, and recruitment activity increased meaningfully compared to 2020. Additionally, more new job positions were added in 2021 versus 2019 and 2020, and we ended 2021 with 20% more job openings than 2019, highlighting our strategic growth in certain geographies and markets. Across industries, workforce data more broadly indicates that voluntary turnover rates were higher among younger generations, lower-tenured employees and women; however, at AIG our voluntary turnover among women was lower than it was among men, demonstrating that we are an attractive place for women to work.

Development 
The world around us continues to transform and we 
are continually facing new challenges and adopting new technologies. For AIG to continue delivering innovative solutions to our clients, our people need to be at the forefront of new trends and innovation. We accomplish this by ensuring our employees have access to meaningful tools and resources to assist in their professional development no matter where they are in their career paths.

Career Development 
and Succession Planning 
Our management is dedicated to promoting internal 
talent. We provide our colleagues with easy access to job postings, including the ability to set job alerts based on their job search criteria. We also offer management training, regular opportunities for formal feedback and mentorship programs to help our colleagues strengthen their skillsets and learn from one another’s professional and personal experiences. This emphasis on sponsorship and internal network building helps our employees take ownership of their careers and enabled 28% of our global talent to attain expanded roles or move laterally within our organization in 2021. 
We are also committed to thoughtful succession 
planning for each of our functions and operating segments. This allows us to identify and develop a pipeline of talent to maintain high-performing business operations. In 2021, we focused on embedding a consistent, streamlined approach to Succession Plans and Talent Development Actions across the organization, including our Executive Leadership Team. This comprehensive approach to talent reviews and succession planning provides a forward-looking perspective on emerging talent, assists in identifying key development actions and strengthens our leadership bench. 
Career Transition Assistance 
AIG provides a number of transition assistance programs for employees whose career at AIG ends as a result of retirement or termination. For entry- and mid-level employees, AIG offers programs such as resume writing, career coaching, job lead assistance and access to recruiters. For executive-level employees, AIG offers more advanced programs, including dedicated executive support, high-caliber career coaching, executive brand support and identification of target career opportunities.

ABOUT THIS REPORT Skill Development 
and Learning Opportunities 
AIG has developed numerous programs to foster 
leadership, growth and development opportunities for our employees. At the heart of these programs is Your Learning Journey, our global learning management system. Through this platform, AIG employees can access learning portals and other resources that increase their business awareness, build critical skills and earn continuing education credits. In 2021, we invested in Your Learning Journey by adding machine learning and social collaboration features to make the platform more engaging and intuitive. Another key platform is our How to Be Your Best website and social platform, which offers employees access to live webinars, learning videos, employee stories and tip sheets to support employee mental and social well-being. Through this platform, we continued to support the holistic well-being and productivity of our employees in a work-from-home environment. 
This year, we also launched a series of new live and 
interactive learning experiences designed by us, for us, to reinforce our culture of excellence in all we do. These programs build core and critical skills in communication, collaboration, personal branding and leadership. In Q4 of 2021, 1,581 of our colleagues around the world participated in these small group training sessions with a live facilitator. Colleagues who 
772K learning and development 
courses were completed by colleagues on AIG’s platform have participated gave the program high evaluation 
scores, particularly regarding their ability to use the skills and knowledge learned in these sessions to enhance job performance. 
In 2021, 772,000 learning and development courses 
were completed by colleagues on AIG’s platform and employees completed an average of 6.46 hours of online learning. In addition to facilitating this online learning through Your Learning Journey, AIG continues to make LinkedIn Learning licenses available to our colleagues across 55 countries, giving them access to a comprehensive suite of 15,000+ courses covering a broad range of topics to build business, creative and technology skills. In addition, we offer tuition and certification training reimbursement programs to encourage employees to enhance their education, skills and knowledge for their continued growth. 
Employee Engagement 
AIG is committed to an engaged workforce. To improve our employee experience and assess the health of our organization, AIG conducted its first Organizational Health Index (OHI) survey in August of 2019. The results were used to embed Health initiatives in the 
AIG 200 operational programs and provide leadership with a roadmap of the issues that were important to our colleagues. The second OHI survey was conducted in January 2021, with 77% of colleagues participating. It covered topics across multiple dimensions, including leadership, business operations and effectiveness, DEI and customer focus to gather colleague insights and ideas to inform initiatives across AIG. The 2021 results showed significant improvement across the company, 
with higher scores in many categories compared to 2019 results. Despite uncertainties presented by the pandemic, colleagues expressed appreciation for AIG’s effective transition to a remote work environment and the company’s colleague-first approach, prioritizing their health and wellness. The 2021 results also highlighted modernizing the operating infrastructure as an area of opportunity.

end processes to improve user experience.

ABOUT THIS REPORT Developing & Recruiting 
Diverse Talent 
AIG believes having a workforce of colleagues with 
diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives is one of our greatest assets. Our colleagues’ differences help us better understand our clients, increase innovation and reduce risk. As we work to build the AIG of the future, we continue to focus on fostering a culture of inclusion that is designed to attract, develop and retain diverse talent. 
As part of these efforts, we carry out external talent 
mapping to identify diverse talent for all critical positions and produce talent profiles on all insurance industry senior diverse talent. 
In October 2020, AIG established a Diverse Executive 
Search Policy that provides guidance to senior leaders hiring for executive-level roles. As part of this policy, hiring managers are expected to interview at least one qualified diverse candidate as part of the final slate of candidates. 
Throughout 2021, we continued our efforts to 
completely align with this policy in our hiring processes. These efforts included establishing partnerships with two U.S. executive search firms that are well known for sourcing talented and diverse executive-level leaders. As a result of these partnerships and our commitment to our slating policy, 99% of eligible candidate slates at the executive level met our diverse slating requirement. 
In addition to aligning with slating requirements, we implemented diverse interview panels to ensure interview panels for leadership roles included leaders from diverse backgrounds. In 2021, 86% of our executive-level interviewer panels were diverse. 
In 2021, we also launched the Signature Series: 
Recruiting for Success, a diversity recruitment training program to source, attract and hire diverse global talent. We also continued to support diverse sourcing and slating to encourage diverse hiring, with 85% of our 2021 interview slates including a diverse candidate. In fact, in 2021, 36% of open executive leadership positions in the U.S. were filled with ethnically diverse talent, 45% of U.S. placements were ethnically diverse and 52% of AIG job placements globally were female. Additionally, AIG’s 2021 global summer intern class was 53% female and our U.S. summer intern class was 51% ethnically diverse. 52% of AIG job placements

ABOUT THIS REPORT We offer several programs that provide additional 
development, mentoring, networking opportunities and training to AIG’s most promising females and under-represented talent. These programs include the Women’s Executive Leadership Initiative (or WELI, launched in 2013), the Executive Men’s Development Initiative (or EMDI, launched in 2016) and the Accelerated Leadership Development Program (or ALD, launched in 2017). AIG’s Women’s Executive Leadership Initiative and Executive Men’s Development Initiative (for men of color) seek to hone executive leadership skills of high-potential employees. Our Accelerated Leadership Development program matches mid-level diverse talent in AIG’s leadership pipeline with senior executive mentors who coach them on essential senior management and executive leadership skills. 
In 2021, General Insurance launched its Global 
Sponsorship Program, which builds upon the Accelerated Leadership Program by intentionally matching mid-level diverse employees with senior leaders across the General Insurance business unit to provide mentorship and leadership training. In Life & Retirement, the Life and Retirement Executive Group, which includes the top 125 leaders in the segment, is also participating in mentoring emerging and diverse talent. 
In 2021, these programs provided development opportunities to nearly 350 diverse employees globally, including two WELI cohorts, one EMDI cohort and 10 ALD cohorts, with 52 of our senior leaders serving as one-on-one sponsors to these programs’ participants. One such program was our monthly Senior Women’s Luncheon series for global female leaders, which continued virtually throughout 2021 and gave women from around the globe the opportunity to listen to and learn from one another as they engaged on topics such as sponsorship, risk taking, storytelling and authentic leadership.

ABOUT THIS REPORT As AIG continues to improve diversity within our 
business, we also are continuously enhancing our reporting of this progress.

Talent As part of AIG’s approach to fostering a workplace 
culture of inclusion and belonging, in 2021 we continued our efforts to raise awareness and provide DEI educational tools to our colleagues. These efforts included creating and offering training sessions such as our Conscious Inclusion training, which was launched in 2021 to help global people managers better understand unconscious biases and form an action plan for implementing inclusive behaviors. AIG provided Conscious Inclusion training to over 800 managers in 2021 and we are working toward the majority of managers receiving this training in 2022. This interactive training provides our colleagues with new tools and resources to assess unconscious The 3E Framework 
We refreshed DEI learning opportunities on the company’s intranet with access to courses and guidance materials to promote an inclusive culture at AIG. Our learning content is focused on creating allyship and conquering bias surrounding the “isms” in the workplace and in our communities through our 3E framework. Although corporate actions are critical to building the vision of a diverse, equitable and inclusive organization, it is individual action that makes that vision a reality. Other Internal DEI Resources 
Other efforts to drive allyship through actions included offering our colleagues impactful volunteer and relevant educational opportunities that also raised DEI awareness. In addition, the dedicated DEI page on our intranet site was viewed nearly 20% more in 2021 than in 2020. On this intranet page, we regularly publish articles that help explain and expand on DEI terminology and concepts, such as microaggressions and intersectionality, to encourage colleagues to act with enhanced awareness in their interactions with colleagues, clients and others in their respective communities. For example, as part of Pride Month in June, we published a guide about pronoun usage and

Resource Groups 
AIG’s Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are groups 
of employees who come together based on shared interests including a specific dimension of diversity and are key to supporting a culture of inclusion and belonging at AIG. In 2021, we saw our ERGs respond to rising social pressures by coming together more than ever to support allyship, intersectionality and wellness. 
AIG has more than 130 ERGs spread across 55 office 
locations in more than 40 countries. These ERGs are supported by a group of engaged volunteers, including an executive sponsor from AIG’s senior leadership, and most of these ERGs have multiple chapters. 
Twenty-eight percent of AIG colleagues participate in ERGs, with 1,100 of our colleagues offering their time and commitment to lead our global ERG network which enhances inclusion and belonging. 
Within each ERG, focus is placed on four objective areas:

ABOUT THIS REPORT Pay Equity AIG is committed to providing a fair 
and equitable workplace for employees without regard to gender, race or ethnicity. We strive to uphold this commitment by implementing global policies that protect our colleagues starting at the beginning of their relationships with AIG, with oversight from the Board of Directors through its Compensation and Management Resources 
Committee. 
Equity In Recruiting 
Our commitment to pay equity is embedded in 
our recruiting policies and practices. To avoid perpetuating the effects of pay inequity that new colleagues may have experienced before joining the AIG team, we do not consider or ask for a job candidate’s compensation history when hiring for positions in the United States, which ensures that our colleagues start at AIG on equal footing. We uphold this policy even in states that do not require it by local law. By holding firm to this policy, we can help break the cycle of pay inequity. 
Setting Global Standards 
All employees at AIG are placed into specific job grades based on their duties and responsibilities, with each job grade providing specific guidance on appropriate salaries. This structure creates pay consistency across all of our global operations and enables employees to better understand and benchmark their compensation. This structure also supports employees by identifying appropriate performance management and career-development opportunities.

2021 AIG Women’s Open 
Our title sponsorship of the AIG Women’s Open is evidence of our dedicated pursuit of gender equity and gender pay equity. With this sponsorship, we aim to demonstrate our commitment to equitable recognition of exceptional achievements of women on the golf course, in the C-Suite and in society more broadly. 
In 2021, the AIG Women’s Open and The R&A set a new benchmark with the announcement of the largest prize fund 
in women’s major championship golf. Increasing the purse by an additional $1 million in 2022 will more than double the prize fund from 2019 when AIG’s partnership with The R&A commenced. These actions are tangible proof of our commitment to these elite women athletes and gender pay equity in women’s golf. Since setting this example, as hoped, other women’s major championships have followed our lead. 
AIG is committed to serving as allies to women in golf, in business and in the 
communities where we live and work. Striving for pay equity and highlighting the achievements of successful women are critical components of this commitment and part of AIG’s core values.

At AIG, occupational safety and health is a

Employee Benefits 
AIG provides comprehensive, competitive benefits to all of our colleagues. This helps us live up to our commitment to be a socially responsible employer and allows us to attract and retain premier talent, particularly as job seekers increasingly value factors beyond their salaries when searching for new roles. 
As a leader in understanding risk, AIG appreciates 
the importance of being protected against everyday issues as well as unforeseen events. Our benefits coverage includes programs for medical, dental, vision, life, disability, business travel accidents and general wellness, which are integrated with social programs where possible. Our coverage also includes commonly offered plans in local markets, including commuter reimbursement, parking benefits and accidental death and disability coverage. 
AIG also supports initiatives that support our 
employees during some of the most critical times of their lives. These include childcare support, same-sex partner benefits and maternity, parental and bereavement leaves.

Assistance Program increased reimbursement for qualified expenses per eligible child from $13,800 to $14,440. Reimbursements are limited to a lifetime maximum of a combined total of two qualified adoptions and/or surrogacy arrangements per employee. 
Other benefits changes targeted specific regions in 
our AIG community. In Canada, we adjusted medical benefits to provide improved paramedical coinsurance and higher limits on psychologist consultations. In our Asia Pacific (APAC) region, as part of our Inclusive Leadership Forum on Pride, we conducted a broad review of benefit programs to ensure LGBTQ+ employees and their partners are eligible to participate. The Asia Pacific region also completed a review of our mental health benefits as part of a new Inclusive Leadership Forum in APAC on Health and Wellness at Work that resulted in all countries in the region providing employees with mental health insurance. 
U.S. Preventive Care Program 
AIG’s 2021 U.S. Preventive Care Program enabled our colleagues to earn a $120 credit toward their employee medical plan contribution in 2022. Employees could earn the credit by completing an annual physical exam or preventive screening, with 7,456 employees participating in this program. U.S. Tobacco Cessation Program 
All AIG U.S. employees completed the tobacco attestation on the 2021 Annual Enrollment website. Employees who attested they had not used tobacco within three months prior to the annual enrollment and who completed the Quit For Life Tobacco Cessation Program did not have a tobacco user surcharge applied to their medical plan contribution rates. During 2021 Annual Enrollment, 316 employees committed to enrolling in the Quit For Life Tobacco Cessation Program, with 110 employees completing the program.

ABOUT THIS REPORT Parental Leave and Support 
AIG recognizes how important it is for parents to bond 
with their child. AIG follows relevant regulations and requirements for parental leave set by individual countries and states. 
In the U.S., AIG offers eight weeks of time off with full 
pay for employee parents for the birth of a biological child, the adoption of a child or the birth of a child born via a surrogacy arrangement. This time off may be taken at any time within 12 months of the child’s birth or adoption.

ABOUT THIS REPORT Global Corporate 
Citizenship 2021 was a year marked by the continuation 
of a pandemic that has disproportionally impacted underrepresented individuals, social justice movements that heightened attention to systemic injustice and immeasurable global uncertainty. In response, AIG leveraged the power 
of volunteerism and philanthropy to 
develop inclusivity, encourage equity 
and advance prosperity within both our organization and our communities. Our employees’ willingness to leverage their expertise, community connections, innovative worldviews and dedication to serving others transcends beyond the excellent products and services they provide. We are deeply proud of the way they have used their time, skills, generosity and voices to create lasting change and sustainable impact. 
Societal needs sometimes feel 
insurmountable, and I think where the opportunity lies is to continue to offer the programs and support that we do for our colleagues to do their own part. 
Laura Gallagher 
Global Head, Corporate Citizenship Governance 
AIG’s nonprofit and nongovernmental partners are

ABOUT THIS REPORT Volunteerism 
Volunteer Time Off (VTO) 
AIG employees may take up to 24 hours of 
paid time off per calendar year (outside 
of their traditional Paid Time Off) to volunteer with nonprofit organizations, including schools. 
Global Volunteer Month (GVM) 
AIG hosts Global Volunteer Month each April. Due to COVID-19, employees volunteered 
virtually from the safety of their own homes in 2021, connecting with each other while contributing their time and skills to their communities. In 2021, over 1,700 colleagues volunteered more than 5,000 hours across 25 countries during Global Volunteer Month. 
Virtual Volunteering 
All AIG volunteer events in 2021 were held virtually with impactful results, including 
providing and delivering over 7,500 Clean the World hygiene kit donations and over 15,500 MATTER healthy snack packs to help address hygiene and food insecurity. 
#GivingTuesday 
On November 30, 2021, more than 650 AIG colleagues and their families from seven 
countries joined the global giving movement by volunteering, donating, conducting acts of kindness and serving as allies. Legal Pro Bono Program 
AIG’s Legal Pro Bono Program leverages colleagues’ expertise and commitment to giving back by providing free legal and related services to those in need. 
Key pillars have included immigration, family law, 
education and mentorship, veterans’ benefits and transgender and non-binary individuals’ rights. In 2020, criminal and social justice reform was added as a key pillar of the Legal Pro Bono Program. We honor this commitment in part by partnering with leading experts and non-profit organizations, aligning our pro bono work and financial support with their efforts and using our platform to magnify the positive effects of their projects. 
For example, the Legal Pro Bono Program established 
a partnership with the Be a Coffee Bean Foundation, founded by Damon West and his wife, Kendell Romero. AIG supports the Foundation’s work, which includes helping incarcerated Black men secure educational degrees and supporting their re-entry into the workplace. 
The Legal Pro Bono Program also supports the Wrongful Conviction Podcast, hosted by Jason Flom, a founding board member of the renowned Innocence Project. With the help of expert attorneys and advocates, Jason shares stories of people who were convicted of crimes they maintain they did not commit. To help our communities listen to and learn from these experts and convicted individual themselves — some 
exonerated and some still fighting for justice — we 
proudly sponsor episodes of the podcast, which educates listeners about the American criminal justice system. 
Since 2012, the Legal Pro Bono Program has partnered with the International Refugee Assistance Project to help 140 refugees in 58 cases find safe, new homes. Many of these cases have involved Special Immigrant Visas, which allow U.S. supporters in Iraq and Afghanistan to resettle safely in America and escape immediate threats from forces who targeted these individuals for their collaboration with the U.S. government. 
The importance of AIG’s experience helping people in danger reach safety was underscored in August, when the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan. AIG took action by assembling a group of our best legal, travel and security experts, including members of AIG Travel’s Security Operations and Intelligence team, who have deep expertise in helping AIG clients evacuate crisis situations. These colleagues worked tirelessly and with dedication during the height of the evacuation process to help Afghans flee to safe countries. 
In 2021, AIG colleagues logged over 4,000 hours 
providing free legal services and other support to a variety of non-profit organizations and disadvantaged individuals.

ABOUT THIS REPORT AIG’s Support of 
Colleagues Through COVID-19 Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, our 
top priority has been protecting the health and safety of our colleagues and our many partners, vendors and clients around the world. We quickly assembled a formal AIG Global Enterprise Resiliency team comprised of experienced leaders with expertise in technology, disaster recovery, enterprise risk and program leadership to ensure strong business resiliency during the pandemic. AIG also developed Emergency Access Plans that could convert AIG offices into limited recovery sites if work-from-home capacity was significantly disrupted by a natural disaster or other incident. 
For those colleagues facing financial 
difficulty due to COVID-19’s severe disruption to businesses, AIG established the Pandemic Financial Assistance Program, which provided financial aid to eligible colleagues. Supporting 
Our Employees 
In 2021, we continued to place great importance 
on supporting our colleagues’ mental health and well-being while maintaining productivity in a work-from-home environment. Our COVID-19 intranet page continues to provide important policy and procedure updates, leadership messages and links to external websites, such as the WHO and CDC, with the latest health and safety information. Using this page as well as our How to Be Your Best page and social platform, we offered employees access to live webinars, learning videos, employee stories and tip sheets to address the unique mental, emotional and social pressures colleagues felt as they balanced work and home responsibilities. 
We also offered all employees up to four hours of paid 
leave to receive their COVID-19 vaccinations in the absence of relevant government and local paid leave mandates and encouraged them to access counseling services through AIG’s Employee Assistance Program.

ABOUT THIS REPORT For U.S. Employees 
AIG has continued to support employee 
physical and mental health by waiving 
employee copays, coinsurance and deductibles for AIG Medical Plan member services through the end of the federally declared COVID-19 public health emergency, including: 
• COVID-19 diagnostic and antibody testing 
• Telemedicine visits related to COVID-19 illness 
with member’s own in-network provider 
• Behavioral health visits with 24/7 virtual care in-network providers Teladoc, LiveHealth and Kaiser Virtual 
AIG also waived all out-of-pocket costs for AIG Medical Plan in-network telemedicine behavioral health visits through December 31, 2021. 
Outside of the U.S. 
AIG removed pandemic exclusions from local medical plans to ensure employees 
and their families have access to quality care. 
In Japan, AIG carried out a COVID-19 Workplace 
Vaccination Initiative at 10 venues across the country. By October 1, 2021, approximately 17,000 employees, contract workers, agents and their families received vaccinations. The preparations for 
this massive effort required extensive coordination with various stakeholders, securing venues and healthcare facilities, confirming individual employee preferences, reservation system setup, venue maintenance and logistics support and providing guidance for employees and agents. Return to the 
Workplace (RTW) 
AIG’s RTW Task Force is a cross-functional 
team comprised of colleagues from Corporate Real Estate & Business Services, Legal, Human Resources, IT , Communications and individual business lines. The RTW Task Force monitors COVID-19 developments closely and take actions to promote the health and safety of AIG colleagues based on guidance from health authorities and subject matter experts at the local, regional and global levels. The RTW Task Force also collaborates with business leaders across AIG to study issues that are relevant to the jurisdictions in which we operate and speaks with counterparts at other companies to determine emerging best practices. 
Our global RTW Task Force, leveraging expert data 
and insights, has partnered with local teams across ~250 locations to make office reentry decisions based on local ground conditions, business needs and individual circumstances. 
Based on the RTW Task Force’s findings, AIG offices 
remained accessible only to those in on-site essential roles from March 2020 through August 2021. In September 2021, AIG offices were formally reopened and made available for occupancy to fully vaccinated individuals where local conditions allowed. Given that in a growing number of jurisdictions global conditions are more stable, at the beginning of May 2022, the expectation is that 
colleagues will be returning to our offices on a more regular basis. Our return to the workplace strategy aims to achieve a return that is safe and flexible while focusing on our core values and strengthening our corporate culture.

ABOUT THIS REPORT Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) 
AIG’s ERM function integrates the risk management 
activities in each of our business units and provides senior management with a consolidated view of AIG’s key risks. It embeds and oversees the risk management of our business processes, which includes identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring, reporting and mitigating AIG’s risk exposures. Accountability for the implementation and oversight of AIG risk policies is aligned with the senior leaders and executives within each business or corporate unit, who are responsible for the implementation and oversight of AIG risk policies, aligning risk-taking policies, risk tolerances and risk prioritization within the framework provided by ERM. Corporate and business unit risk committees receive regular reports regarding compliance with AIG risk policies. With respect to ESG and climate risk, ERM is supporting the development and implementation of activities through the identification of emerging risks, monitoring external developments and the potential for risk aggregation and risk accumulation across our underwriting and investments and our own operations. ERM is also supporting the development of our climate risk management and mitigation approaches, in particular where we have local regulatory requirements and expectations to meet across our international businesses. When monitoring and quantifying Insurance Risk aggregation potentials for AIG, sustainability issues are factored into assessments of sources of claim exposure, claim frequency and claim severity.

The AIG Code of Conduct (Code of Conduct) applies to all colleagues and provides guidelines on how we work with each other, as well as our clients, distribution partners, regulators and other stakeholders. Each year, AIG officers and employees certify that they have reviewed and will comply with the principles of the Code of Conduct, which is available in 20 languages, reviewed annually and updated as necessary.

ABOUT THIS REPORT In the same vein, AIG maintains a Code of Business 
Conduct & Ethics (Code of Ethics) for our Directors, Officers and Senior Financial Officers, each of whom must review and agree to comply with the Code of Ethics each year. 
All AIG employees are also required to abide by the 
Global Employee Conflicts of Interest policy, which instructs colleagues on how to identify, prevent and manage potential conflicts of interest. This helps all our employees perform their work in an objective and unbiased manner. 
Our Global Compliance Group (GCG) helps us hold 
ourselves accountable to our standards. The GCG is a centralized, independent function responsible for compliance management across AIG’s businesses, functions, legal entities and countries of operation. The GCG helps us stand behind the quality of our products and services. This includes ensuring that our business partners, such as agents and consultants, adhere to the Code of Conduct and the AIG Third Party or Supplier Code of Conduct, as well as any applicable contractual provisions, when working on behalf of AIG companies. 
   
  
 
   
 
AIG also provides regular training for all AIG employees on a range of compliance and ethics topics. These topics include the Code of Conduct and other key compliance risk areas like conflicts of interest, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering 
and economic sanctions. Moreover, AIG requires all managers to incorporate a Culture of Integrity 
and Risk Management goal in their annual performance goals. This helps our colleagues commit to demonstrating a culture of awareness and ownership of AIG’s policies and procedures, ethical behaviors and practices, prudent risk management in day-to-day activities and AIG’s Governance and Regulatory requirements. Reporting 
Misconduct 
An important aspect of AIG’s ethical culture is taking 
accountability for our individual and collective decisions. We encourage employees to address compliance and ethics issues with management, Human Resources, Employee Relations, their assigned legal counsel and/or their compliance officers. AIG policy strictly prohibits retaliation against any employee for making a good faith report of actual or suspected violations of the Code of Conduct, other AIG Policies or applicable laws or regulations. Violation of this policy may be grounds for disciplinary action. 
Our Risk Awareness Program encourages this open 
dialogue about compliance and ethics issues by asking employees to uphold an ethical and compliant work environment, including through our Raise Your Hand campaign. This campaign is reinforced throughout the year through various channels, including senior leader communications, the company intranet site and risk awareness campaigns addressing topics like fraud and cybersecurity. Additionally, AIG employees and third parties may ask questions, raise concerns or report instances of non-compliance with the Code of Conduct, AIG policies or applicable laws and regulations through the AIG Compliance Help Line. The AIG Compliance Help Line is staffed by an independent third party that provides written reports to AIG’s GCG. Communications to the AIG Compliance Help Line may be made anonymously, subject to local laws, and may be made in all major languages.

ABOUT THIS REPORT Lobbying and 
Public Policy AIG regularly communicates with 
government and regulatory officials regarding the issues that impact our company. We believe this engagement helps us understand and safeguard the interests of our business, clients, employees and shareholders. 
During 2021, as in prior years, AIG’s state, federal and 
international advocacy efforts largely focused on traditional areas of activity and interest within the insurance industry. These include the regulation of insurance product design, pricing and taxation; market conduct; the regulation of underwriting and claims handling and retirement security. We anticipate these traditional industry issues will continue to absorb most of our regulatory monitoring and advocacy efforts. 
Climate change is increasingly a focus area for 
regulators in recent years. In 2021, the trend continued as regulators of several key countries where we operate progressed their climate change initiatives. 
Throughout 2021, we engaged with government and 
regulatory officials to better understand the evolving policy frameworks regarding climate change. These advocacy efforts reflect AIG’s belief that climate risk regulation is necessary, important and inevitable, and that insurers can play an important role in climate adaptation, mitigation and assisting with the transition to a low-carbon economy. Our engagement included providing feedback to policymakers based on our insurance expertise and communicating our position that regulations should be sensible, risk-based and 
consistent across jurisdictions to avoid a proliferation of competing standards that will overburden organizations and potentially yield an inconsistent impact across insurers. All of our engagement is done in compliance with local regulations, disclosure requirements and reporting requirements. 
Lobbying Disclosure 
AIG files quarterly LD2 reports in compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act. These reports publicly disclose all our U.S. federal lobbying activities, including all lobbying-related expenses, all issues that the company is currently lobbying and the entities lobbied. Past LD2 reports can be found on the U.S. Senate Lobbying Disclosure Website here. 
Similar requirements for lobbying activities exist in 
non-U.S. jurisdictions. AIG operates in compliance with the local requirements for these non-U.S. activities, including registering on public lobbying registries regardless of whether they are mandatory or voluntary.

ABOUT THIS REPORT Political Donations 
On January 13, 2021, AIG suspended its limited 
Political Action Committee (PAC) activity for the foreseeable future. All political contributions made by the AIG PAC are publicly disclosed and can be found in the Federal Election Commission’s publicly available campaign finance data http://www.fec.gov/. AIG does not make political donations outside the U.S. 
For 2021, AIG received a “Trendsetter” designation for 
our political disclosure and accountability policies and practices for election-related spending in the annual CPA-Zicklin Index published by The Center for Political Accountability and Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. This designation was given to leading U.S. public companies that received a score of 90% or higher on the Index, and AIG received a score of 97.1%. 
External Organizations 
AIG belongs to various external organizations and associations (Associations) that advocate for or comment on public policies affecting AIG and the insurance sector. These external groups include trade groups and think tanks that participate in public policy discussions in different ways. 
During 2021, AIG reviewed a select number of 
Associations to identify whether there was a misalignment between AIG’s climate risk policies and values and the policies of the Associations to which AIG belongs. AIG concluded that the vast majority of the Associations in which we hold membership are either (a) narrowly focused on a core set of insurance specific topics that do not extend to climate issues, or (b) are constructive participants in public policy discussions around climate risk regulatory developments. We also identified a small subset of Association memberships that have been reproached for their climate risk positions and advocacy efforts by certain climate change advocacy groups. In these instances, AIG’s activities in — and our ability to influence the policy 
direction of — the Association are limited. 
Further details including the methodology behind the review, the disclosure of our Association memberships and the full review results are available on AIG’s corporate website. 
AIG’s Global Trade Series (GTS) 
Since its launch in 2019, the AIG GTS has gained international recognition as an influential forum for discussion about the changing nature of the global trading system. The GTS is a unique partnership between AIG and some of the world’s leading centers of expertise on global trade from Europe, the U.S. and Asia. It analyzes the challenges facing the rules-based multilateral trade system and explores solutions through a genuinely global lens. 
The 2021 GTS was a series of 10 podcasts featuring 25 
international trade experts including former EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom and former Acting Deputy US Trade Representative Wendy Cutler. The GTS podcasts have been reaching a growing audience of influential thinkers and decision makers, and key insights from the series have regularly been shared in briefing sessions with policymakers in Washington, D.C., Brussels and Tokyo. 
The podcasts continue AIG’s longstanding history of advocacy on trade issues and demonstrate our support for open, rules-based and sustainable trade, which we see as essential to a growing global economy and prosperous, resilient communities. The GTS Podcast Series can be accessed here.

ABOUT THIS REPORT Cybersecurity 
and Data Privacy AIG recognizes the importance of 
information security and privacy for our business. As our world becomes increasingly connected and globalized, our customers expect and deserve an experience and environment that values security and privacy. 
Managing Our Cyber Risk 
AIG’s cross-functional cybersecurity and privacy teams 
work diligently to process and safeguard company and customer data appropriately. AIG maintains a suite of information security, privacy and data protection-related policies, standards, procedures and guidelines. These are informed by widely accepted industry frameworks such as National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, the International Organization for Standardization 27002 standard and the Cyber Risk Institute Profile. Our policies and procedures are reasonably designed to comply with all applicable laws, regulatory guidance and widely adopted industry best practices. 
AIG’s Information Security Office prepares for and responds to cybersecurity threats by implementing a strategy that is designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all information owned by, or in the care of, the company. This includes our Identity and Access Management program, which uses multi-factor authentication to provide an additional layer of defense against unauthorized access to our systems. AIG also maintains cyber and privacy incident response plans that outline the appropriate processes and procedures for incident management, including minimizing the impact of incidents, investigations and remediation. We also comply with applicable legal requirements, including timely and accurate reporting of any required cybersecurity or privacy incident, and conduct global cyber-incident response practice exercises to maintain our preparedness.

ABOUT THIS REPORT AIG continues to advance our cyber intelligence and 
analytic capabilities by proactively searching for and identifying evidence of malicious attacks while testing our cybersecurity defenses. In doing so, we are able to analyze how we should enhance our security program and reduce our attack surface. These efforts include comprehensive risk assessments, external security audits and program enhancements such as the launch of a Responsible Disclosure Program. 
AIG’s cybersecurity efforts are not confined to 
our cybersecurity and privacy teams, although employees in those functions do receive role-specific cybersecurity and privacy training. We require all AIG employees to complete mandatory cybersecurity awareness and information handling and privacy training at the time of onboarding and on an annual basis. Non-employee workers with access to AIG systems must also complete compliance training that includes information handling and privacy training. This training must be completed at the beginning of their engagement, with follow-up training every 18 months. We regularly test our personnel using various techniques, such as simulated phishing campaigns, to validate the efficacy of our cybersecurity training. 
AIG has several channels that provide information 
about our privacy practices and the individual rights of our customers and other relevant parties, as applicable. Privacy notices are provided to customers pursuant to various country and state laws, and our online privacy statements explain how we generally collect, use, share and safeguard personal information. 
Cybersecurity Risk Oversight 
AIG’s Board of Directors is regularly briefed by management on AIG’s cybersecurity matters, including threats, policies, practices and ongoing efforts to improve security. These regular briefings include updates on matters such as the results of incident response readiness and maturity capability assessments that are periodically led by third parties who provide an independent assessment of our technical program and internal response preparedness. 
Leading Out Against Cyber Threats 
AIG holds leadership positions in or is a member of a number of cyber information sharing organizations, including the Financial Services Information Sharing and Advisory Council, the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative and the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance. Through these organizations, we partner with other companies, organizations and law enforcement to share and receive information about the latest cyber threats. Our membership in these organizations also gives us access to advanced threat modeling insights that we integrate into our own cybersecurity programs.

ABOUT THIS REPORT AIG Cyber Products and Services 
For more than 20 years, AIG has helped our clients 
protect their data, networks and IT systems. Society’s increasing reliance on technology has underscored just how important this support can be, and future events like the spread of 5th generation wireless and virtual reality technologies will only increase the need for our clients to protect themselves against emerging cyber risks. 
As a provider of cyber insurance, one of our important roles is to help companies better manage cyber risk at the onset and guide them on how to strengthen their controls to mitigate or avoid significant loss in the future. The cyber insurance we offer provides our clients with financial protection by means of risk transfer and supports our customers through the post-incident response. 
AIG collaborates with our stakeholders, including 
customers, claims professionals, cyber risk advisory teams and leading cybersecurity experts, to understand the cyber threat landscape and root causes of reported events. We integrate these findings into the underwriting process and share this knowledge with cyber insurance customers and applicants. 
We assess loss potential from “affirmative” cyber 
coverage by performing rigorous portfolio aggregation analysis using a proprietary QlikView-based “Cyber Portfolio App” and a proprietary stochastic scenario model. Should an incident occur, the AIG Claims team is on call and ready to respond. Our Claims staff is proud to have helped thousands of companies recover operations after damaging cyber security events such as data breaches, ransomware attacks and system outages. 
AIG also enhances cyber insurance underwriting 
by acquiring externally observable data about an organization’s digital footprint from third parties. This data assists us in identifying precursor malware events or software vulnerabilities that may be exploited by criminal actors designed to cause substantial loss to victim companies. 
Setting the Standard 
on Cyber Risk Management 
We continue to lead the industry in addressing coverage 
challenges and critical risks, from increasing contract clarity through affirmative cyber coverage to advising clients on a constantly changing threat environment. 
To individually evaluate potential cyber risks 
clients may face, AIG introduced a ransomware risk assessment that allows us to better ascertain a current or potential client’s specific cybersecurity controls. These assessment results combined with our advanced analytics and leading claims experience helps us identify critical vulnerabilities and exposures and provide our clients with unique solutions that can improve their ransomware risk management programs and inform their cybersecurity investments. 
Life & Retirement — Protecting Against Fraud 
An increasingly important factor in protecting the sustainability of retirement savings is cybersecurity and fraud prevention. In 2021, AIG Life & Retirement continued to advance our own information technology security measures, including firewalls, encryption, secure email and preemptive around-the-clock surveillance. We also continued to educate clients about best practices for keeping their financial information safe. As a member of the SPARK Institute, a nonprofit organization that helps shape national retirement policy, AIG Group Retirement contributed to SPARK’s Data Security Oversights Board and its development of seven industry best practices to help prevent fraud. This fraud prevention work was timely, as it was announced just before the Department of Labor released its Tips for Cybersecurity.

 This report includes American International Group Inc. ’s approach to 
measuring and managing performance of its key ESG focus areas for fiscal year 2021 (January 1–December 31, 2021) unless otherwise stated in the report. In this report, unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context indicates otherwise, we use the terms “AIG, ” the “Company, ” “we, ” “us” and “our” to refer to American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
As discussed elsewhere in this report, AIG is undertaking various 
organizational changes. On November 2, 2021, AIG and Blackstone Inc. (Blackstone) completed the acquisition by Blackstone of a 9.9 percent equity stake in Corebridge Financial, Inc. (Corebridge), formerly known as SAFG Retirement Services, Inc., which is the holding company for AIG’s Life & Retirement business. As part of the separation of the Life & Retirement business from AIG, most of AIG’s investment operations were transferred to Corebridge or its subsidiaries as of December 31, 
2021, and AIG entered into a long-term asset management relationship with Blackstone to manage an initial $50 billion of Life and Retirement’s existing investment portfolio beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021. We are factoring these expected organizational changes into our ESG strategy and it will be reflected in future ESG reports. About This Report 
The methodologies, assumptions and estimates used to calculate climate-related data (including GHG emissions) are still in the early stages of development and are likely to change in future periods, including as a result of regulatory or other developments. Such changes could result in changes to the data presented. 
In addition, as appropriate, developments occurring in early 2022 
may be referenced in this report and may be expanded upon in future reports. 
To guide the content of this report, we consider external frameworks such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Standards (SASB), the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, the UN Global Compact and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. SASB, TCFD, GRI and UN Global Compact indices are provided in Appendix A, B, C and D, respectively. 
We include sustainability information in our investor communications, 
and additional information about AIG’s operations and financial statements is available in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a high-level overview of AIG’s sustainability, visit https://www.aig.com/ about-us/sustainability . Send questions, comments or feedback to
