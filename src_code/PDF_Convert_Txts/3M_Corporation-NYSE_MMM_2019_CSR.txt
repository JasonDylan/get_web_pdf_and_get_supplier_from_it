3M 2019 Sustainability Report
44A message from our CEO
At 3M we are a 
purpose-driven 
enterprise.  
We know that we can grow our 
business while collaborating 
to solve some of humanity’s 
greatest challenges. And we know 
that innovation isn’t innovation 
without Sustainability. 
3M is a longtime leader in 
Sustainability, going back decades 
to our ground-breaking Pollution 
Prevention Pays program, which 
has prevented more than two 
million tons of pollution. We have 
since built on that leadership 
by continuing to reduce our 
own footprint; since 2002, for 
example, we have reduced our 
greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 
64 percent, while doubling our While 3M has a strong foundation, 
we know that we have the ability 
— and the responsibility — to do 
even more. Going forward, we 
are focused on three priority 
areas where we can make an even 
greater impact on the world.
•  Science for Circular: Design solutions 
that do more with less material, 
advancing a global circular economy
•  Science for Climate: Innovate to 
decarbonize industry, accelerate 
global climate solutions, and improve 
our environmental footprint
•  Science for Community: Create a 
more positive world through science, 
and inspire people to join usIn December 2018, we announced 
a major initiative as part of this 
new framework: Beginning in 
2019, every new 3M product will 
articulate a Sustainability Value 
Commitment, demonstrating 
how it drives impact for the 
greater good. Because 3M 
launches approximately 1,000 
new products each year, crossing 
many industries and geographies, 
the impact will expand greatly 
with each successive year. 
Looking ahead, we will continue 
to step up our leadership toward a 
more sustainable future — in our 
own operations, and in solutions 
for our customers. In 2019, we 
plan to announce substantial new Sustainability initiatives under our 
new framework in accordance 
with the United Nations Global 
Compact and its principles. 
And we invite you to join us.

on 3M’s 2025 Sustainability 
Goals, and last year exceeded our 
targets for renewable energy and 
reducing manufacturing waste.
At the same time, we’ve invested 
more to create a wide range 
of innovative solutions that are 
helping our customers be more 
sustainable — from strengthening 
solar and wind power, to making 
businesses and homes more energy 
efficient. Last year alone, our 
products helped customers avoid 
nearly 15 million metric tons CO 2

of select 3M product platforms.Our leadership#improvinglives7
3M 2019 Sustainability Report
7 6We recognize that no one 
company or community alone can 
solve the world’s Sustainability 
challenges. We’re using this 
framework to engage with our 
talented employees and global 
stakeholders to make connections 
and establish partnerships to 
make even greater progress. 
It has been an exciting and 
promising year for Sustainability at 
3M, and going forward we expect 
to share more announcements 
about new goals and partnerships 
as we continue our journey as 
a purpose-driven enterprise.

Vice President and Chief 
Sustainability Officer
Creating products that use 
energy efficiently and make 
the best use of the Earth’s 
resources is not new at 3M. From 
our automotive electrification 
technologies that power lighter, 
more durable, energy-efficient 
connected vehicles, to our filtration 
technologies that protect people 
and filter air pollution, our products 
and partnerships are changing the 
world. Sustainability goals are now 
considered in the earliest stages of 
every new product’s development.Beginning in 2019, every 
3M product entering 
the new product 
commercialization 
process will include 
a Sustainability Value 
Commitment that 
demonstrates how it 
drives impact for the 
greater good. A message from
2018 was a big  
year for Sustainability 
at 3M.
We have a strong history of 
leadership in setting goals that drive 
environmental stewardship and 
pollution prevention, and advance 
health and safety in communities 
around the world. We’ve made 
substantial progress against those 
ambitious energy, water, and 
climate 2025 targets — and we’re 
committing to do even more. The world faces tremendous 
challenges in this time of 
unprecedented change. Science 
plays a critical role in building a 
resilient future where everyone 
can thrive. At 3M, science is at the 
heart of what we do. We collaborate 
with our customers, governments, 
and communities — with the 
ambition to improve every life.
In this pivotal moment, we’ve 
developed a new Strategic 
Sustainability Framework to direct 
our efforts to areas in which we Gayle 
SchuellerA message from our CEO Our leadership
can partner with our stakeholders 
to make the biggest impact.
Building on our global capabilities 
and diverse technologies, we are 
focusing on three priority areas: 
Science for Circular , 
Science for Climate , and  
Science for Community . 
Using this framework, we are 
developing new milestone targets 
for air, energy, water, and waste.
3M CEO, Mike Roman, announced 
this new business strategy in 
November. One month later 
we announced our first new 
goal that embeds Sustainability 
into the pipeline that produces 
3M’s diverse global products.

 Introduction
Commitment in all new products 
builds on 3M’s history of creating 
products that emphasize 
reuse, recycling, and reduced 
resource use. For example:
•  Roofing materials that improve 
air quality and address climate 
concerns, like our award-
winning 3M™ Smog-reducing 
Granules for rooﬁng shingles 
•  Automotive electrification, 
powering the future of mobility 
•  Indoor freestanding devices that 
attract and capture airborne dust, 
lint, dust mite debris, mold spores, 
pollen, pet dander, smoke, smog, 
bacteria, and viruses from the 
air passing through the filter
•  Scouring solutions that use up to 
100 percent recycled materials
3M launches approximately 1,000 
new products each year, with a 
significant fraction of its revenue 
generated from products released 
in the past five years. The multiplier 
impact of this Sustainability Value 
Commitment on our product 
portfolio will be immense.
Reaffirming a 
commitment to 
renewable
The year 2018 culminated with 
finalizing plans for a stepped-up 
commitment to renewable energy, 
doubling our current 2025 global 
goal and switching our St. Paul, 
Minnesota, headquarters to 100 
percent renewable electricity, 
effective March 1, 2019. The 
goal is now to convert our entire 3M actively pursues Sustainability-
inspired innovation. This is as true 
today as it was more than four 
decades ago, when 3M launched 
its groundbreaking Pollution 
Prevention Pays (3P) program.  
When the 3P program was 
launched in 1975, the concept 
of applying pollution prevention 
on a company-wide basis and 
documenting the results was an 
industry first. Since then, employees 
have completed more than 15,300 
3P projects, prevented more 
than 2.5 million tons of pollution, 
and saved nearly $2.2 billion.
In the 1990s, we began publicly 
reporting progress on Sustainability 
goals. In 2015, we established a 
new set of ambitious 10-year (2025) 
goals addressing issues ranging 
from raw materials to education 
and development.  And in 2018, 3M 
was listed for the 19th straight year 
on the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Index, a global stock index touted as 
the gold standard for Sustainability 
among corporations worldwide.A legacy of 
leadership
inspires a framework 
for greater goodfocus areas of the Sustainability 
framework; and (3) uncover the 
most effective ways to build 
engagement among stakeholders. 
Among the key 
findings:
•  Most material issues for 3M  
fit well into the three focus areas 
of our Sustainability strategy
•  Stakeholders overwhelmingly 
show a strong interest in 
engaging and collaborating with 
3M on Sustainability issues
•  Stakeholders encourage 3M to be 
bold and share a science-based 
point of view for each pillar
At Investor Day in November, 
Michael Roman announced the 3M 
Strategic Sustainability Framework, 
which focuses on three areas in 
which we will partner to make 
the greatest impact: Science for 
Circular, Science for Climate, 
and Science for Community. 
Putting our products 
where our purpose is
In December, at the annual United 
Nations Climate Conference 
(COP24), we shared our first 
major goal in conjunction with 
the Strategic Sustainability 
Framework: Beginning in 2019, 
every new product that enters 
3M’s commercialization process 
must have a Sustainability Value 
Commitment demonstrating how it 
drives impact for the greater good.
Requiring a Sustainability Value operations across 70 countries to 
renewable electricity by 2050.
And the journey has 
just begun
Science operates within a set of 
rules. It follows specific methods. 
It delivers proof and proves cause 
and effect. But science also 
breaks boundaries, challenges the 
status quo, and improves lives.
As a company rooted in scientific 
exploration and the belief that 
every problem has a solution, we 
are applying our technological 
expertise to help solve some of 
the world’s biggest challenges. 
The challenges we must tackle for 
a sustainable future don’t always 
follow clear rules or methods — 
but we see them clearly. They 
are broad. They are interrelated. 
They are solvable. We know 
science can help tackle them.
We are looking at ways to build 
purpose into leadership and 
talent development across the 
company, to recognize business 
opportunities that help the 
company grow while addressing 
societal issues. We cut across 
industries and silos to collaborate 
with suppliers, customers, 
and communities by working 
together toward building a more 
resilient world. We have a unique 
opportunity to apply our passion 
and collaboration to help the 
world prosper, and we’re looking 
forward to continuing the journey 
as a purpose-driven enterprise.By any measure, 3M’s commitment 
to Sustainability is not new. And by 
no means has it been insignificant. 
But given the actions taken in 
the past year, it’s clear we now 
have even greater ambitions for 
working toward the greater good.
2018: the year 
momentum multiplied
In 2018, 3M took several steps 
to set an aggressive long-term 
strategy for the company, with 
the intent to use our passion, and 
science, to tackle challenges where 
we can make the biggest impact — 
challenges critical to a sustainable 
planet and the people living on it.
It began in July, when new 3M 
Chief Executive Officer, Michael 
Roman, announced that advancing 
Sustainability at 3M is a priority 
for us, our stakeholders, and 
our customers. It’s at the heart 
of who we are. He asked what 
it would mean to be visibly 
leading, and innovating, for a 
more sustainable future.Shortly following, 3M’s executive 
team selected a small focus group 
to develop the foundation of this 
new strategy. With the foundation 
established, more than 80 company 
leaders and subject-matter experts 
convened. Using Lean Six Sigma 
methodology, external insights, 
and with bold leadership in mind, 
this team added depth to the 
framework by identifying the 
current state and opportunities.
“Because 3M is a science-based 
company with diverse operations 
and a large product portfolio 
serving nearly every industry 
across the globe, we’re in a unique 
position to make impact ourselves, 
and enable impact by others,” says 
Cassandra Garber, 3M Global 
Sustainability Leader. “Our new 
Strategic Sustainability Framework 
demonstrates where our critical 
opportunity as a company meets 
the critical opportunity of our world 
and gives us a means of prioritizing 
how to most effectively take action.”
Building from the strategy’s 
foundation, 3M launched an 
internal survey and commissioned 
Globescan, a public opinion 
research consultancy, to 
interview external stakeholders 
globally. The goals of this work: 
(1) identify the social, economic, 
and environmental issues 3M 
should focus on; (2) test the three 3M 2019 Sustainability Report

13 123M takes  
front-row seat
in United Nations’ panel  
on climate changeScience for Climate
When you do an online search of 
the term “climate change,” you get 
more than 400 million results. 
And one of the most impactful 
organizations appearing in these 
results is the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).Established in 1988 by the World 
Meteorological Organization and 
the United Nations, the IPCC 
provides scientific, technical, 
and socioeconomic assessments 
on the state of climate change 
and the risks associated with 
it, along with detailed policy 
guidelines and recommendations 
for the world’s policymakers. 
For 13 years, 3M has had a front-
row seat to the IPCC proceedings. 
3M EHS Laboratory Manager 
Brian Mader is one of 188 authors 
and review editors from academia, 
national laboratories, industry, and 
non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) who currently evaluate 
and write reports on various areas 
associated with climate change.Each member 
country in the United 
Nations nominates 
people to represent 
their country on 
different climate 
subjects. Mader is 
part of a 32-member 
committee that 
focuses on industrial 
processes and 
product use.
Mader was nominated in 2005 by 
the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, who liked the work 3M was 
doing on greenhouse gases (GHG): 
“When we did our first GHG report, it 
was new territory for us. We had to 
develop a lot of our own methods to 
determine our GHG inventory, and 
we did that. When the EPA found 
out there was a desire on the part 
of the IPCC to write guidelines for 
how countries could add up their 
emissions, they recommended me.” The selection worked out well. 
In 2007, the IPCC was awarded 
the Nobel Peace Prize “for 
their efforts to build up and 
disseminate greater knowledge 
about man-made climate change, 
and to lay the foundations for 
the measures that are needed to 
counteract such change.” Mader 
was formally acknowledged for 
his contribution to that effort.
As science progresses, so do the 
IPCC guidelines. Currently, the 
group is working on its second 
year of refinements for the 2019 
guidelines. Updates are primarily 
new GHG measurement methods 
companies and organizations 
can use, but also new categories. 
Take, for example, the smelting 
of rare earth metals: In 2006, no 
method existed to estimate GHG 
emissions from rare earth metal 
production, but now there is, so 
there’s a new section on that.
About the process, Mader says, 
“You spend time talking about 
exact wordings — like, should 
a procedure be listed as good 
practice versus best practice? — 
and then you form a consensus, 
always based on science.
“Given the current contentious 
political climate, it’s admirable that 
IPCC reaches out across countries, 
across industry, academia, 
government, and NGOs. When 
I go to the meetings, it’s very 
much a mixture of these folks, all 
working for a common cause.
“It’s satisfying, too, that 3M thinks 
it’s important enough to support 
my involvement in this effort.”

15 143M 2019 Sustainability Report
In the past, society followed 
a linear economy in which 
companies made products, and 
customers used and disposed of 
them. In recent years, people have 
increasingly embraced a circular 
economy, where the goal is to 
design out waste, keep products 
and materials in use, and integrate 
more renewable raw materials. 
One new example of the 
circular economy at work — in 
the home — is Scotch-Brite® 
Heavy Duty Scrub Sponges. 
These iconic yellow sponges 
with a green scrubbing layer 
are a top-selling scrub sponge 
brand in the U.S. They remove 
tough, baked-on messes, which 
makes them ideal for kitchen, 
garage, and even outdoor use. 
Just as important, when customers 
in the U.S. use their favorite 
sponge now, its ability to clean 
won’t be its only advantage. That’s because a recent 3M 
innovation has made it possible 
for us to begin making the green 
scrubbing fibers from 100 percent 
recycled content (including an 
average of 35 percent post-
consumer recycled content). 
With this change, 100 percent 
recycled scrubbing fibers will 
not only be incorporated into 
Scotch-Brite® Heavy Duty Scrub 
Sponges, but also in U.S. versions 
of the following 3M products: 
•  Scotch-Brite® Non-Scratch 
Scrub Sponges (blue)
•  Scotch-Brite® Gentle Clean 
Scrub Sponges (pink)
•  Select Scotch-Brite® 
Dishwand Refills 
•  Scotch-Brite® Non-Scratch 
and Heavy Duty Scour Pads
“Enhancing our products to fit the 
circular economy is a focus at 3M, the Consumer Business Group, and 
the Scotch-Brite™ Brand,” says 
Marketing Manager, Lisa Bloomer. 
“We’re pleased to combine this 
exciting material innovation that 
leverages recycled content with the 
superior scrubbing performance our 
customers rely on with our brand.”
Each of these 
scrubbing products, 
by the way, will 
provide performance 
equal to sponges 
made without 
recycled content.

Health and safety professionals 
around the world need to stay 
up to date on the latest training. 
This means access to educational 
content to learn, share, experience, 
and make a difference. One of 3M’s 
2025 Sustainability Goals revolves 
around training. By building on 
our existing customer education 
programs, we are looking to help 
educate individuals on worker 
and patient safety in both health 
care and industrial settings.
Here are two examples of programs 
that are helping us reach this goal.3MSM Health Care 
Academy
Education and training have always 
been part of the value provided 
to customers of 3M Health Care 
businesses. In 2014, an insight-
driven design solution, 3M’s  
Health Care Academy , established 
best practices for validating 
intuitiveness and usability of 
the eLearning experience. The 
solution was created as an 
educational platform that connects 
industry leaders, scientists, and 
inventors to improve professional 
expertise and patient outcomes.
Says Lisa Edstrom, Global Leader 
Health Care Academy, “Until 
3M introduced the Health Care 
Academy, we lacked a unified 
and reliable global resource 
for providing education to our 
customers. From a technology 
standpoint, we didn’t have 
a consistent way to deliver 
content and gather feedback 
from our customers.”
Before creating anything, Edstrom 
and her team first did deep-dive 
research with customers and 
conducted a competitive analysis 
of training platforms. Based on 
what they learned, 3M launched the Health Care Academy online 
platform in 2016, then added 
mobile capabilities in 2018 — 
so health care professionals 
could download courses from 
their phones, learn at their 
convenience, and monitor their 
personal progress online. 
At the same time, there has 
been a focus on the content 
itself — making it as relevant and 
engaging as possible for health 
care professionals. (By the way, 75 
percent of the content is accredited 
for continuing education.) 
With the addition of 50 new 
offerings in 2018, the total library 
now consists of more than 1,200 
courses. In addition, attendance at 
live webinars grew to 32,000 in 
2018. And Health Care Academy 
content is now offered in 33 
countries and 15 different languages. 
In total, 3M has educated over 
350,000 professionals around the 
globe through in-person events, 
webinars, and online education.
What’s more, things continue to 
evolve. “Practically every month 
we’re taking steps to make our 
platform more robust,” Edstrom 
says. “Especially important to 
me is that we’re now able to 
track user feedback regarding content, which will allow us to 
create new content that’s even 
more relevant to people whose 
everyday job is improving lives.”
Oral Care 
Master Class 
Conference
In October 2018, more than 
400 oral care professionals from 
Poland and Ukraine gathered 
in Lodz, Poland, for the second 
edition of the 3M Oral Care 
Master Class Conference — three 
days of live demonstrations, 
lectures, certification courses, 
and practical workshops for both 
dental and orthodontic practices. 
Participants in this interdisciplinary 
event included dentists, 
orthodontists, dental assistants, 
dental clinic managers, and a roster 
of internationally known lecturers, 
including instructors from the 
highly regarded Style Italiano group. 
Among other highlights at the 
conference were four “phantom 
rooms,” which replicated actual 
clinical working conditions. In these 
rooms, using phantom patients, 
dentists participated in hands-on 
workshops on adhesive cementing; ceramic, composite and porcelain 
veneers; and advanced teeth 
modeling from composite materials. 
“The Master Class Conference 
enabled attendees to learn 
techniques that can elevate 
the quality of their work and 
save them time,” says Grzegorz 
Grzegorz, 3M Regional Scientific 
Affairs & Education Leader. “Just 
as important, these techniques 
can help them improve the 
lives of their patients.”
“The conference has been an 
excellent way for us to strengthen 
the bond we have with our 
clients, and for them to learn 
from each other,” he says.

3M  
Personal  
Safety  
Division  
Academy
In a rapidly evolving business 
and occupational health and 
safety landscape, one thing 
remains constant: the need for 
effective training and education.
To that end, 3M’s Personal Safety 
Division (PSD) Academy offers 
a variety of tools and software 
to support the safety training 
needs associated with personal 
protective equipment (PPE), 
including eLearning opportunities, 
demonstration vehicles, safety 
roadshows, and even virtual 
reality learning experiences. 
One example: For more than 10 
years, the PSD team in India has 
been sensitizing the government’s 
Ministry of Labour & Employment 
(MOLE) and the Directorate 
General, Factory Advice Service 
and Labour Institutes (DGFASLI), a 
technical organization within the 
MOLE, on the need to enhance 
awareness among the industrial workforce on various aspects of 
health and safety in general and 
on the right selection of PPE in 
particular. This effort helped to 
establish 3M as a subject-matter 
expert in the PPE category.  
In 2017, the collaboration reached 
a new level when the first-ever 
public-private sector Memorandum 
of Understanding (MoU) was 
signed by 3M and the MOLE.
One concept brought to the MOLE 
by 3M was “Safety on Wheels,” two 
mobile training units that would 
travel to over 1.3 million small and 
medium-size enterprises at 550 
industrial clusters throughout India. 
On board these 35-foot, fully 
equipped mobile training 
centers, 3M’s network of experts 
conduct safety training and 
demonstrations, educates workers 
and safety officers, and talks about 
occupational safety and prevention 
of injuries and disease. Among the 
PPE products demonstrated by 
the Safety on Wheels teams are 
earplugs, eye and face protection 
gear, respirators, and full-body 
fall protection harnesses.
To support attendance, the MoU 
signed between 3M India and 
the MOLE enables the MOLE to send companies an official order 
to have their employees visit the 
training units when they are in 
their area or at their factory. 
Since its launch in 
September 2017, the 
program has trained 
more than 92,000 
industrial workers 
across 902 industries 
covering 16 out of a 
total 29 Indian states. 
Looking forward, the goal is 
to train more than 1 million 
users in the next four years.
Leading the Safety on Wheels team 
for 3M India is Vinay Pathak, Senior 
General Manager – Technical, who 
says, “This program was first of 
its kind for the PSD. It has already 
been a great brand-building 
initiative and promises to deliver 
strong long-term benefits for 
companies and for the people who 
work in industry in our country.”

In the automotive 
industry, the road 
ahead looks very 
different than the 
road in our rearview 
mirror. Changes have come faster in recent 
years, says Ray Eby, Vice President 
of 3M Automotive Electrification, 
and will continue to accelerate 
in the next few years, “driven by 
environmental and safety demands 
and the need to provide users 
with the experience they expect.”
Individual vehicle owners 
can see the benefits: greater 
digital connectivity, lower 
fuel consumption, reduced 
maintenance costs, and, 
someday, driverless vehicles.And then there’s the reduction of 
tailpipe emissions of operating 
vehicles that run on electricity 
rather than gas. Electric vehicles 
(EVs) reduce smog-forming and 
other pollutants harmful to human 
health, along with greenhouse 
gases, primarily carbon dioxide 
(CO₂). Typical passenger vehicles 
alone currently produce 4.6 
metric tons of CO₂ per vehicle 
per year.1 According to the EPA 
Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies 
Calculator, it would take 5.4 
acres of U.S. forests to sequester 
the typical passenger vehicle’s 
carbon emissions each year.
Together, these industry changes 
are expected to transform electric-
powered automobiles from a niche 
category to mainstream. According 
to International Energy Agency 
forecasts, the number of EVs on 
the road will increase from 3 million 
in 2017 to 125 million by 2030. 23M: plugged in  
to the potential
To date, the stationary energy 
storage market has seen 
rapid growth as utilities and 
consumers have recognized the 
value in pairing batteries with 
windmills and solar panels. 
The EV market can be more 
challenging than conventional 
combustion engine vehicles. 
Beyond the concern of the battery 
pack delivering energy, automakers 
need to consider the effects of 
harsh temperatures, mechanical 
vibrations, and weight. Auto 
electrification designers must 
consider the complete car 
ecosystem, ranging from cooling 
systems to power electronics, and 
how those functions impact the 
car’s powertrain design and safety.
3M is helping them meet the 
challenge. Using many of our 
technology platforms, we 
are producing EV battery 
pack components for both 
automakers and major 
automotive industry suppliers.
Our involvement in EV battery 
development includes bonding 
tapes and adhesives to hold battery components together, 
thermal management materials 
that help take the heat away, and 
“light-weighting” products that 
enable longer driving range. 
Some examples:
•  3M™ Novec™ fluid-based 
technology is designed 
to help cool and protect 
electronics and batteries
•  3M™ E-A-R™ cushioning 
products help extend 
battery life by guarding 
against normal structural 
vibrations and disruptions
•  High-temperature adhesives 
and tapes to help form strong 
bonds in battery packs so 
they hold up even in the 
most extreme conditions
•  3M insulating and shielding 
materials help improve overall 
battery performance
One global team
Because so many technologies 
are used in improving EV battery 
performance, 3M leaders have 
done away with traditional division 
boundaries and focused instead 
on serving customer needs. Says Brandon Bartling, an advanced 
product development specialist 
in automotive electrification, 
“We don’t go to the customer 
representing a division. We go to 
them as 3M. We learn what the 
customer wants, then we bring that 
back and share it with our team, so 
we can all work together to solve 
the problem instead of trying to 
figure out who gets credit for it.” 
3M automotive electrification 
specialists in different regions 
also work with their counterparts 
in other parts of the world, 
because although they share 
similar technology, country-
specific manufacturers often 
take a slightly different tack on 
what they want in an EV battery.
Electrification is enabling great 
advancements in the auto industry, 
says Bartling, and 3M is right in the 
middle of it. “In terms of circling 
the wagons, and getting people 
together on it, 3M is among the 
leaders in putting a concerted effort 
around automotive electrification.”

For Maureen Tholen, 3M Safety & 
Graphics and Industrial Business 
Groups Sustainability Director, 
the lightbulb went on three years 
ago. That’s when Tholen and some 
fellow 3M employees made the 
decision to travel to Louisville, 
Kentucky, to see what the SkillsUSA 
national competition was all about.
“We went there to see what 
more 3M could be doing, and 
should be doing, to support an 
organization the company had 
already been involved with for 
more than a decade,” she said.
Tholen and her teammates were 
first struck by the event’s footprint. 
There were more than 5,000 
competitors and nearly 2,000 
judges and contest organizers from 
across the country. There were 
also more than 100 categories in 
the competition, from architectural 
drafting to dental hygiene to 
welding fabrication, many of which 
make use of 3M’s products. Their next thoughts expanded the 
possibilities: “We could see right 
away that SkillsUSA represented a 
tremendous business opportunity 
for 3M — an opportunity to 
help us create connections and 
broader awareness of the 3M 
brand among the next generation 
of skilled laborers, to help 
industry and schools expand 
education in science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics 
(STEM) fields, and to help us 
create a pipeline of skilled workers 
for 3M and our customers.” 
The 3M team also felt there 
was value in volunteering for a 
leadership role in the organization, 
to have a voice in shaping the 
future of trade careers in America.
This last observation became a 
reality in October 2018, when 
Tholen was named Chairperson 
of the SkillsUSA Foundation, Inc., 
the nonprofit, philanthropic arm 
of SkillsUSA. In this position, she 
helps guide strategic thinking as the organization seeks to expand 
its outreach from 360,000 
students to a million in the next few 
years, as well as build a stronger 
alumni network, inviting past 
SkillsUSA students to serve as 
mentors, judges, role models, and 
potential financial contributors 
to future training offerings.
Tholen will serve a two-year term 
as Chairperson of the SkillsUSA 
Foundation Board, which is 
made up of representatives from 
business, industry, organized 
labor, and others who assist in 
fundraising and offer expert advice 
and counsel to the organization. 
3M is also the lead sponsor 
of the 2019 WorldSkills USA 
team, selected and trained by 
SkillsUSA. This sponsorship will 
support the efforts of the 23 
competitors and their technical 
experts as they train to represent 
the United States at WorldSkills™, 
the largest international 
showcase of the skilled trades, 
in Kazan, Russia, in August. What enthuses Tholen most about 
the potential in this organization? 
“The greatest pleasure comes from 
talking to students and listening to 
their stories. When you hear those 
stories, see what they’ve already 
accomplished, and realize the great 
opportunities they have in front of 
them, it’s very motivating for me.”
Asked about Maureen and 3M, 
SkillsUSA Executive Director 
Timothy Lawrence said, “Having 
an individual of Maureen’s caliber 
leading our foundation will have 
a lasting impact on SkillsUSA 
programs.”
“When major partners 
like 3M step up to 
support us, it sends 
a powerful signal to 
corporate America 
that we are doing 
valuable work. 
SkillsUSA could not 
exist without this 
level of industry 
support.”A natural match for 
our 3M Science for  
Community pillar
3M support of SkillsUSA and 
WorldSkills is very much in line 
with our pillar 3M Science for 
Community, says Francine Savage, 
3M Health Care Sustainability 
Director. “These are organizations 
that every 3M business can 
support. They enable productive 
employment and sustainable 
economic growth through the 
investment and encouragement of 
skill building for current and future 
workers. Their community benefits 
from 3M Science, via our products 
and the expertise of our people.” Power to

Science for Circular
Anyone who has shipped something 
to a friend, family member, or 
business contact knows the truth: 
Packing an item for shipping 
is a multi-step, multi-product 
process. First, you have to find the 
right-sized box, then add filler to 
prevent damage to the item you’re 
shipping, and finally seal your 
package with tape. Lots of tape. 
But after doing research with 
consumers about the rigors of 
shipping, 3M has come up with an 
easier, simpler, sustainable option. 
It’s called the Scotch™ Flex 
& Seal Shipping Roll.
The Flex & Seal packing solution 
eliminates unnecessary steps, 
supplies, and space while 
protecting the package contents 
that are so important to you and 
the people who receive it.Flex & Seal rolls are 15 inches wide 
by 10 feet long and made with the 
same material as plastic bags — so 
you may be able to recycle it at 
retail stores that have a plastic 
bag recycling program (ask your 
retailer). One side of the roll is blue; 
the other side is gray. When you 
have something you want to send, 
you cut a section of the roll that 
can wrap around the item you’re 
sending. With blue side out, you 
fold the material over the item 
and press gray side to gray side 
together for a secure seal. Apply 
your label and you’re ready to ship. 
The material cushions to protect a 
wide range of sizes and shapes. Plus, 
the durable outer film resists water 
and tearing, and can be written on. Outside-the-
box thinking
leads to a sustainable  
shipping solution
In fact, compared with 
traditional shipping 
boxes, testing has 
shown that consumers 
could save up to 50 
percent of their time, 
supplies, and space 
by using Flex & Seal 
shipping rolls. No 
boxes, no filler, and  
no tape are needed.#improvinglives3M 2019 Sustainability Report

#improvinglives 3M 2019 Sustainability Report Science for Community
Skin is one thing we all have in 
common. It’s the identity we share 
with the world. It’s also a guide 
that can inform assessment and 
influence care. When we start 
with skin, we make a different 
commitment to the people we serve 
— one that considers health from 
the outside in, not just the inside 
out. It’s time to look beyond the 
surface of skin. To treat it differently. 
It’s time to think skin deeper. 
“When you enter a hospital, or clinic, 
or other care facility,” says Heather 
Cmiel, 3M Communications 
Strategist, 3M Medical, “Skin 
often becomes an afterthought. 
Clinicians are more concerned with 
the condition of a patient’s heart, 
lungs, brain, liver, and other organs.” 
This incongruity is what led 3M 
to launch a new awareness-
building, care-enhancing 
program, “Thinking Skin Deeper.” When the 3M Health Care business 
embarked on this journey in June 
2018, it decided it would create 
three different buckets of content 
to help boost appreciation for 
skin among clinicians, facility 
administrators, purchasing managers, 
and anyone else who interacts with 
patients on a daily basis, and makes 
decisions on what kinds of skin care 
solutions will be used: 
1. Education 
In this program, the point of 
education is to define the natural 
life cycle of skin, explain why skin 
matters, and describe the steps 
that should be taken to ascertain its 
proper care in a health care setting. 
2. Empathy 
Almost everyone has had an 
experience that captures what 
happens when skin isn’t carefully 
managed. Sharing an incident 
that has happened to them, or 
someone in their family, or 
someone they know is compelling 
motivation for clinicians to 
give skin due consideration. 
3. Solutions 
This content bucket explains 
different skin conditions and what advancements have been made 
to address them. It’s not a product 
story. This program is, after all, not 
about short-term sales. It’s about 
shifting mindsets, long-term — 
opening doors in a different way.
Many of the tools developed to 
help shift mindsets can be found at 
thinkskindeeper.com . Among them: 
emotional, individual story videos; 
long-form expert panel videos on 
the state of skin; a 54-page state 
of skin report document; technical 
webinars; award recognition 
for clinicians; and deeper dives 
into the most common forms 
of skin problems, and how to 
prevent and/or treat them.  
Communications have included 
online messaging on LinkedIn, 
periodic communications with 
the database of clinicians 3M 
has developed through the 
years, and an audience-involving 
interactive skin exhibit used at 
professional conferences. 
In the first few months after 
launching the Thinking Skin Deeper 
program, the 3M team has come 
to one conclusion regarding 
campaign metrics: The most prolific 
numbers have been connected 
with the individual story videos, 
says Cmiel. “When clinicians hear those stories, I think it triggers 
something with them; that skin 
deserves to be higher on the list of 
care priorities than it sometimes is.” 
Matthew M. Cooper, Global Senior 
Medical Director, 3M Health Care 
Business Group, says, “When 
you think about it, skin is actually 
the largest organ in the body. It 
is deeply entwined in what we 
think about ourselves, and how 
we present ourselves to the world. 
With this program, we are training 
to change the mindset about the 
importance of caring for skin as 
part of a holistic view of patient 
care. It won’t be just what you do 
to repair the inside, but what you 
do to preserve the outside that 
counts. Moreover, it will be one of 
the ways people differentiate great 
hospitals from average hospitals.” 
There’s a Sustainability perspective 
in this story, too. When you do 
the right thing from the beginning 
with skin, fewer materials are 
needed and less waste is produced, 
recovery time is shortened, 
and less time and energy are 
consumed treating compromised 
skin. It all has a spiral effect 
that is more than skin deep.Skin matters:
Raising up the  
largest organ in  
the human bodyWith Thinking Skin Deeper, 3M is 
looking to elevate the importance 
of skin, and the benefits of properly 
managing its condition.

29 28In studies conducted by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency 
and its Science Advisory Board (SAB), 
indoor air quality has been ranked 
among the top five environmental 
concerns facing the public today. 1
Fortunately, for over 25 years, 
3M has been delivering cleaner 
air to homes and businesses 
with Filtrete™ Filters.
Now, there’s a powerful new 
way to use this technology 
to improve indoor air quality: 
Filtrete™ Room Air Purifiers.
Combining an advanced air control 
housing with a high-performance 
Filtrete™ Filter, these freestanding 
devices attract and capture airborne 
dust, lint, dust mite debris, mold 
spores, pollen, pet dander, smoke, 
smog, bacteria, and viruses from 
the air passing through the filter.
In fact, the Filtrete™ True HEPA 
(high-efficiency particulate arresting) Filter removes 99.97 percent 
of airborne particles 2 that can 
contribute to poor indoor air 
quality — including PM2.5 
(atmospheric particulate matter 
as small as 2.5 micrometers 
in diameter) and particles 
1,000 times smaller than those 
visible to the human eye.
Five Filtrete™ Room Air Purifier 
models have even earned the 
ENERGY STAR® certification by 
meeting strict energy-efficiency 
guidelines set by the EPA. 
Certified models are measured 
based on a ratio between the 
model’s Clean Air Delivery 
Rate (CADR) for dust and the 
electrical energy it consumes.
An ENERGY STAR® logo on the 
product packaging makes it 
easy for consumers to identify 
and purchase these consoles — 
helping save them money on 
energy bills without sacrificing 
performance, features, or comfort.All Filtrete™ models feature either 
three or four fan speeds, quiet 
operation, and an electronic filter 
life indicator. They are available for 
rooms up to 370 square feet in size.

takes on a whole new meaningTraditionally, these partnerships 
begin with the pharma company 
asking 3M for help formulating a 
drug into an aerosol format – and 
for device technology that delivers 
the drug with the most effective 
response from patients. 3M 
then responds with a design that 
matches the customer’s need. 
In some cases, though, we simply 
put wonder to work, innovating 
using our own initiative. 
That’s what 3M scientists did 
in 2014. They looked into the 
future of drug delivery to see 
what could possibly be done 
to improve the management of 
these diseases with a device.
“The problem is that most patients 
don’t use their inhaler properly, so 
they’re not getting the treatment 
they need,” says Rebecca 
Blakey, 3M Global Business 
Leader, Connected Respiratory 
Health, Drug Delivery Systems. an issue, nor is the forcefulness 
with which one breathes in. 
This is similar to some current 
inhaler technology. But any 
similarity ends there. The 3M™ 
Intelligent Control Inhaler also 
has an “on board” display and a 
companion mobile app that can 
provide medication and refill 
reminders — to promote adherence 
— as well as real-time coaching 
on inhaler technique that keeps 
patients engaged in their therapy.
Blakey says, “The app provides 
tips and insights that can help 
patients improve their technique 
and better manage their respiratory 
health. Patients can also choose 
to share their data with clinicians 
to help evaluate device usage and 
monitor disease progression.” 
The 3M™ Intelligent Control 
Inhaler will be brought to market in 
partnership with a pharmaceutical 
company, and is projected to be in 
use within the next several years.
Says Blakey, “When 
it does go to market, 
we believe it will 
engage patients 
and lead to better 
respiratory health 
outcomes.”

 32Science for Climate
According to the American Lung 
Association, nearly four in 10 
Americans currently live in counties 
with unhealthy levels of ground-
level ozone or particle pollution. ¹ 
Unhealthy levels, unfortunately, 
can translate into cardiovascular, 
respiratory, neurological, and other 
physical challenges 2 that take their 
toll on people living in those areas. 
At 3M, we’re working on many 
ways to address these challenges, 
which also affect people in other 
countries around the globe.
One of the most innovative and 
potentially powerful tools involves 
sunlight and a new generation 
of coated roofing granules.
3M™ Smog-reducing Granules 
for roofing shingles were created 
and launched in 2018 by the 3M 
Industrial Mineral Products Division. 
Inspired by a roofing 
manufacturer’s curiosity about 
smog reduction, these tiny granules have a specialized photocatalytic 
coating that 3M applies to the base 
mineral on a shingle’s surface.
When sunlight hits the shingles, 
the sun’s ultraviolet rays transform 
pollutants such as nitrogen oxide 
gases into nonpolluting, water-
soluble ions that wash away.
In one early test, the manufacturer 
used a blend of 95 percent 
standard granules and five percent 
3M™ Smog-reducing Granules 
in its shingles. Shingles with this 
blend were sent to Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory 
for evaluation, where they were 
exposed to nitrogen oxides in a 
reaction chamber. Nitrogen oxide 
concentrations were recorded 
in real time prior to, during, and 
after UV illumination. The result? 
Lawrence Berkeley calculated that 
each ton of these granules used 
in shingles has the capacity to 
mitigate the smog created annually 
by one car driven 3,000 miles.  “The roofing granules are a first 
for residential asphalt shingles,” 
said Frank Klink, 3M Senior 
Laboratory Manager. “The new 
3M granules will help roofing 
manufacturers develop high-quality, 
aesthetically pleasing shingles 
that can turn any roof into an 
active, smog-reducing catalyst.”
Lara Ughetta, Commercialization 
Leader for 3M ™ Smog-reducing 
Granules, concurs: “We look at 
what the impact of this product 
can be, and it’s pretty mind-
blowing when you start adding 
up the aggregate effects of 
individual roofs being turned into 
smog-reducing surfaces. It could 
make a big difference, especially 
in markets where smog has 
been a persistent problem.” 
“We view smog-reducing 
technology, embedded into 
mainstream roofing materials, as 
a great step forward in addressing 
society’s air quality and climate 
concerns,” said Jonathan Parfrey, Founder and Executive Director of 
Climate Resolve, a U.S. nonprofit 
organization focused on local 
solutions to global climate change.
The 3M Industrial Mineral Products 
Division has also developed other 
products that help contribute 
to climate improvement.
Shrinking urban  
heat islands
3M™ Cool Roofing Granules 
are up to four times more 
reflective than other standard 
colored granules, based on 3M 
reflectivity test methods. They 
help communities bring down 
the urban heat island (UHI) effect 
in cities like Los Angeles, where 
nonreflective impermeable 
surfaces of urban roofs and 
pavements get warm enough in 
the sun to actually heat the air. 
Reflecting on  
the commercial 
roofing scene
3M™ Highly Reflective Granules 
are a component in asphalt cap 
sheets, installed on commercial, 
low-slope roofs. They’re designed 
to reflect 70 percent of solar rays for 30 years or longer in 
a category where many of the 
alternatives fail in 10 years or less. 
Converting waste into 
bonus business
According to Josh Orman, 
Strategy and Marketing Manager 
in Industrial Mineral Products, 
the division is also developing 
sustainable businesses around its 
own waste products. “We know we 
want to do more for Sustainability. 
Reducing pollution is the right thing 
to do. And it can offset a company’s 
costs. Less waste is less cost and 
better for our environment. It’s 
a win-win.” Offering an example, 
Orman says 3M is now selling from 
its quarries formerly landfilled 
rock dust, or fines, to ceramic 
tile manufacturers for use as a 
component in their tile slurries. Up 
to 30 percent of the volume of tiles 
can come from these fines. And 
because of the chemical properties 
of the fines, manufacturers are 
able to make tiles while keeping 
their kilns at a lower temperature, 
thereby saving energy. These 
fines can also be used to level out 
construction sites and roadways.
Another waste reduction play, says 
Orman, is using a fine-as-flour rock by-product from 3M quarries 
as a supplemental cementitious 
material (SCM) in the production 
of concrete. By promoting this 
environmentally-progressive 
alternative to traditional fly ash, 
this fines reclamation process has 
moved thousand of tons of SCM 
to the company’s bottom line in 
the first 12 months of the initiative. 
Add this to other fines reclaimed 
by the 3M Little Rock, Arkansas, 
plant — and sold for use in 
construction fill, tile manufacturing, 
asphalt roads, and other industrial 
applications — and total mining by-
product sales exceeded hundreds 
of thousand of tons in 2018.
In its pursuit of business that 
aligns with Sustainability, the 
3M Industrial Mineral Products 
Business leaves no stone unturned.

Bringing  
smiles
to schoolchildren in China Science for Community
In 2018, in partnership with FDI 
World Dental Federation (FDI) 
and the Chinese Stomatological 
Association, 3M Oral Care 
implemented an educational 
program to increase oral 
health knowledge and skills 
among schoolchildren, and to 
elevate teaching of oral disease 
prevention among teachers 
and oral health professionals.
None of this is coincidental, says 
Eric Wenzel, 3M Oral Care 
Global Business Director — 
Restoratives. “If you look at our 
vision, it’s to promote lifelong oral 
health. Working with different 
organizations and associations 
around the world like we did in this 
program helps us live that vision.” 
The Smile Around the World 
(SAW) program involved well over 
3,000 elementary schoolchildren 
and 90 teachers in the Chinese 
provinces of Ningxia, Yunnan, and 
Shaanxi, along with 115 volunteer 
oral health professionals.Jerry Spartz, 3M Oral Care Global 
Business Team Leader, explains: 
“We chose China for two reasons. 
One, there is a real need there. 
They have a large, emerging 
middle class that can benefit from 
education. Two, our 3M China 
colleagues were as enthused 
about the program as we were.”
Initially developed by FDI, the 
SAW program was designed to 
teach good oral hygiene to young 
children who have limited access 
to oral health care, through cultural 
and educational programs that 
are engaging and entertaining. 
Program activities included:
•  Dentists and teachers using 
teeth models to demonstrate 
proper toothbrushing 
technique to children
•  Children practicing toothbrushing 
in groups and checking each 
other’s results using a “Healthy 
Smile Happy Smile” booklet
•  Children sharing the seven 
steps to healthy teeth with 
their parents, as homework
•  Children drawing their 
image of an ideal smileComplementing the activities 
was a media campaign that 
received exposure from 130+ 
newspapers, TV stations and 
digital media outlets in China. 
Most important: after the program 
was completed, 99.1 percent 
of children said they believed it 
is very important to brush their

of children who said they were 
brushing their teeth twice daily 
increased by 20 percent. 1
“We are thrilled with the success of 
SAW in China and the leading role 
children played in this initiative,” 
says Dr. Kathryn Kell FDI President. 
“Thanks to the support provided 
by 3M and working with our 
member organization the Chinese 
Stomatological Association, we 
were able to raise oral health 
awareness among 3,614 children 
in western China. We look forward 
to educating even more children 
in 2019 and extending the reach 
of World Oral Health Day, so that 
together we can help lead the 
world to optimal oral health.”
Mitsi O’Neill, Global Scientific 
Affairs, 3M Oral Health and 
Prevention, is equally enthused 
about the prospects for the future. “ What I liked most 
is that it really 
demonstrates how 
good connections 
around the world  
can help 3M have  
an impact globally. 
Our community 
extends beyond the 
areas in which we 
live,” says O’Neill.
The program will travel to other 
communities and support World 
Oral Health Day in 2019. 
In other words, there’s a 
lot here to smile about.

assembles products in Juárez, 
and returns finished goods to 
the U.S., along with any waste 
generated in the production 
process. The plant employs up to 
6,000 full-time and 1,500 seasonal 
workers — and provides food, 
health care, and transportation 
for employees and their families. 
The challenge for Edumex has 
been water. Due to their heavy 
water use and proximity to 
local neighborhoods, Edumex 
and other maquiladoras in 
Juárez can actually “starve” the 
surrounding areas of water. 
But when Edumex sought ways to 
lower its dependence on potable 
water, it made an unexpected 
discovery: A city water treatment 
plant located near the Edumex 
facility had more treated water than 
it knew what to do with — because 
there was no way to share it, says 
Laura Acevedo, Environmental, 
Health and Safety (EHS) Manager. “Only 7 percent of the water 
treatment plant’s capacity 
was being used,” according to 
Acevedo. The rest was simply 
being returned to drainage.
Edumex leaders and maintenance 
personnel explored ways to 
gain access to the water from 
the treatment plant, and after 
two years of discussions and 
negotiations with the Juárez City 
Water Department, they came up 
with a way to lay a pipeline to their 
facility without having to dig up 
local streets or spend city funds.
In 2016, this pipeline was 
opened, and the treated water 
flowed to three of five buildings 
in the Edumex complex for use 
in bathrooms and for irrigation 
of green areas. This is water 
that was formerly returned to 
drainage. Potable water was 
still used for toothbrushing, 
handwashing, and food preparation 
in the company’s cafeteria.
In 2017, nearly 80 percent of 
total water consumed in the 
three Edumex buildings was 
treated or recycled water. Only 
20 percent was potable water 
from the city’s aquifer. Acevedo 
says the 80 percent figure 
will go even higher in 2018. In 2019 and 2020, the remaining 
two buildings in the Edumex 
complex will be connected to 
the treated water pipeline. 
Total savings of potable 
water on the campus 
will be more than 50 
million liters a year. 
“We always knew there was an 
issue with water in Juárez,” says 
Acevedo, “but I don’t think we 
ever realized how many benefits 
would be possible from doing 
something like this. The outcome 
has helped reduce our draw on 
the clean water system, we’ve 
been able to plant and irrigate 
more trees on our property and 
make it possible for as many as 
10 other nearby maquiladoras 
to tap into this water supply.”
The city of Juárez is on the 
bandwagon, too. They are willing 
to take on some of the cost of 
laying pipeline, because they see 
a benefit in doing so for Juárez 
residential neighborhoods. To 
prevent exhausting aquifer 
reserves, the city is also working 
to change local construction 
codes. They are even talking 
about doing a media campaign to 
raise awareness of the adverse 
effects of not conserving water.Water is a precious 
resource everywhere, but 
especially in a place like 
Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. 
A city of more than a million 
people located just across the 
Rio Grande River from El Paso, 
Texas, Juárez sees meager 
rainfall and many days with 
90 degree F heat every year. 
According to the WBCSD-
Global Water Tool™, Juárez 
is in a water-stressed area as 
defined by the extremely high 
baseline water stress value. 1
The use of treated water in 
Juárez is a key to maintaining 
the area’s water supply. This 
is where a 3M partnership 
is improving lives. 
Edumex is a 3M-owned 
maquiladora company that 
provides production capabilities 
for 12 divisions of 3M. As a 
maquiladora, Edumex receives 
raw materials from the U.S., “Among the companies in this city, 
Edumex has positioned itself as a 
pioneer in the use of treated water 
in its processes,” says Francisco 
J. Núñez, Director of Regulatory 
Compliance and Sanitation for the 
Juárez City Water Department. 
“They have been an example 
to follow for other companies, 
which also are gradually adopting 
more sustainable practices.”
“I give much credit for all of 
these good things to the Edumex 
Maintenance Department,” says 
Acevedo. “We dream, and 
maintenance makes it happen.”
It should also be noted that Edumex 
is a good corporate citizen in 
other ways. The Juárez facility 
donates to multiple orphanages, 
provides scholarships to students, 
helps remodel classrooms at 
the local technical university, 
provides adult learning classes 
for employees, and helps build 
houses in the community.
In more ways than one, you could 
call this an oasis in the desert.

There are several ways Cynthiana, 
Kentucky, stands out among 
3M facilities in the company’s 
worldwide operations. 
For starters, it would be hard to 
find a facility that’s more colorful. 
3M Cynthiana, you see, makes 
the world’s supply of Post-it® 
Notes — which includes no less 
than 56 different colors (at last 
count) of the iconic 3M product.
Cynthiana is also one of seven 
U.S. 3M facilities that send 
no manufacturing operations 
waste to landfills, and it’s the 
largest of those facilities. 
The effort to make the facility 
“zero waste to landfill” began in 
2010, says Bryan Schroers, EHS 
Engineer. “In the beginning, our 
cross-functional team did a lot 
of dumpster diving and made 
a lot of trips to landfills. As we 
came across waste streams 
that could be identified, we looked for ways to do something 
besides send them to landfill.”
“Since 2010, the facility has been 
able to eliminate 360 tons of waste 
per year that previously went to 
landfills,” says Michael Thrun, 
3M Cynthiana EHS Manager. 
According to Eric Opland, 
Plant Manager, “Right now, 97 
percent of our facility’s waste 
is recycled in some fashion.”
That said, reaching the zero-
waste-to-landfill milestone in 
the fourth quarter of 2016 was 
not the end of the journey. 
In 2018, the facility held a 
number of kaizen (continuous 
improvement) events, exploring 
ways to improve disposal efforts, 
such as combining waste streams 
where appropriate and authorized.
The Cynthiana EHS team also 
participated in a 3M EHS Summit 
in February 2018, attended by the company’s Consumer Business 
Group. The goal of the summit: 
to share best practices and, in 
doing so, help other facilities with 
their plans to improve employee 
safety and deliver on the corporate 
Sustainability initiatives. By the 
conclusion of the event, attendees 
had developed a five-year plan 
for each manufacturing facility.  
At 3M Cynthiana, commitment to 
zero waste to landfill is only one 
of many Sustainability initiatives. 
Says Thrun, “Every day, we’re also 
looking at ways to reduce water, 
energy consumption, and volatile 
organic compound emissions.”
In addition, through daily 
production reviews, facility 
leaders have identified five areas 
that account for 80 percent 
of recordable worker safety 
events — pinch points, powered 
industrial vehicles, knife injuries, 
housekeeping, and ergonomics. 
Thrun says, “We have teams 
assigned to each hazard, to 
identify where the risks are, and 
conduct training in those areas 
for all 3M Cynthiana employees.” Community support
In addition to donating each year  
to local nonprofits, employees  
participate in a wide range of 
volunteer service activities — from 
an annual clean-up of Licking River 
to painting Cynthiana City Hall, to 
volunteering time on community 
boards. On average, 3M Cynthiana 
employees donate about 2,500 
hours annually to local nonprofits. 
Finally, 3M Cynthiana stands  
out in applying for and receiving 
grants from the 3Mgives program.

 3M facility spotlightFacility spotlight
At 3M, the concept of continuous 
improvement doesn’t begin  
and end with products. 
Proof positive of this can 
be found in the company’s 
facility in Xin Qiao, a suburb of 
Shanghai, China’s largest city.
Opened in 1998 and currently 
home for around 800 3M 
employees, Shanghai Xin Qiao has 
made significant strides in recent 
years to reduce waste, volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs), water 
consumption, and electrical usage.The plant uses 
five different 
manufacturing 
platforms — 
coating, converting, 
compounding, 
extrusion, and non-
woven fabrication — 
to produce a wide 
range of products, 
including paper tape, 
foil tape, conductive 
tape, structural and 
spray adhesives, 
reflective sheeting, 
and fire protection 
products. The facility makes products for four 
of the five 3M business groups: 
Industrial, Electronics and Energy, 
Consumer, and Safety and Graphics.
Waste
Brian Peng, Shanghai Xin Qiao 
Environmental, Health, and Safety 
(EHS) Manager, says, “In terms of 
waste reduction, we have optimized 
our coating and mixing processes 
to allow us to reuse solvent for 
cleaning and reduce the quantity of 
hazardous waste we generate. We 
also categorized the waste we had 
been incinerating and found that 
we could recycle some of it instead 
of incinerating it. These efforts also 
have the added benefit of reducing 
our overall VOC emissions.”
Water
At Shanghai Xin Qiao, water 
conservation and reuse opportunities 
are continually evaluated. The 
facility is reducing its use of city 
water (potable drinking water) and 
replacing with non-potable water. 
At the same time, by developing 
onsite storage for this non-potable 
source, the facility has been able 
to further reduce its dependence 
on the city’s drinking water supply. Energy
To address new emission control 
requirements established by the 
Shanghai Environmental Protection 
Bureau (EPB), 3M Shanghai Xin 
Qiao is optimizing operation and 
maintenance of its pollution control 
equipment, regenerative thermal 
oxidizers (RTOs), and thermal 
oxidizers (TOs). This increase in 
pollution control equipment also 
means an increase in consumption 
of electricity and natural gas, so 
actions have been taken to offset 
this increase. A new solar system 
generates about five percent of 
the facility’s electrical power 
requirements, including lighting, 
electric car charging, some 
process equipment, and hot water 
for employee use. A redesigned 
local exhaust ventilation and 
coating line oven process reduces 
emissions air flow and energy 
use. Behind the scene, an online 
energy monitoring system tracks 
energy use by production line every 
minute, every day, every month. 
VOC
In the past two years, continuous 
improvement has also produced 
reductions in VOC emissions. 
Adhesive ingredients have been 
redesigned, reducing solvent use. Improvements in the 
emissions capture method has 
reduced VOC emissions. RTOs 
and TOs have been upgraded 
to increase their destruction 
removal efficiency (DRE).
Together, says Peng, these 
actions have reduced VOC 
emissions from about 500 tons 
to about 140 tons per year in 
the future, an achievement that 
was rewarded with a Shanghai 
Green Supply Chain Award from 
the Shanghai EPB and an EHS 
Achievement Award from 3M. 
“We will work to continue to 
bring this number down, but it’s 
encouraging to see the results 
we’ve been able to achieve in the 
last couple years,” says Peng. 
And just so the facility’s emissions-
advanced products themselves 
don’t get overlooked, it should be 
noted that the facility manufactures 
a wide range of water- and 
solvent-based, low-VOC, and 
GREENGUARD™ certified 
adhesives for some of the most 
demanding applications in the world.
“Whenever customers are 
ready to go greener,” says 
Peng, “3M Shanghai Xin Qiao 
is ready to take them there.” 43 42

The population of Cordova, 
Illinois, is less than 700.
So, it stands to reason that 
with more than 480 employees 
working at the 3M facility 
in that community, many of 
these employees come from 
well beyond the city limits.
It also explains why, when it 
comes to stepping up to improve 
the lives of people living in 
the area, the people at 3M 
Cordova put few boundaries 
on their efforts. More on 
this in a few paragraphs.   
First, let’s talk business. Opened in 1970, 3M Cordova 
makes a wide variety of specialty 
chemicals and adhesives. At 
Cordova, they blend, react, and 
purify hundreds of products using 
a wide variety of technologies 
throughout the facility. Ultimately, 
these products are used 
by other 3M manufacturing 
facilities or go into industrial, 
commercial, and consumer 
applications around the world 
for a broad range of customers. 
Novec™ 1230 Fire Protection 
Fluid is one example of a product 
being produced at this high-tech 
facility. Novec 1230 is a clean 
agent fire extinguishant, which was 
developed as a halon replacement 
and hydrofluorocarbon 
(HFC) alternative. 
Mike Parent, 3M Cordova Plant 
Manager, is in contact with 
managers of the other four 
divisional facilities at least once a 
week, often comparing notes on 
topics related to Sustainability. Cordova,  
Illinois
 3M facility spotlight“ One area we are focused on now 
is waste-to-energy streams. We’re 
actively identifying outlets that 
can convert our waste materials 
to energy,” says Parent. 
Rich Stutzki, Environmental Health, 
Safety and Regulatory Manager 
at Cordova, says the facility has 
also been active in developing and 
executing 3M Pollution Prevention 
Pays (3P) projects, since that 
program began in 1975. Throughout 
the history of the program, the 
facility has implemented more 
than 500 3P programs, large 
and small, that have prevented 
over 145.8 million pounds of 
air, water, and waste pollution. 
A spirit of giving that 
goes for miles
As mentioned, 3M Cordova 
employees come from a broad 
radius of communities in northwest 
Illinois and northeast Iowa. This 
leads to involvement in a wide 
range of volunteer and fund-raising 
projects, which are directed by 
the facility’s Community Giving 
Committee and often suggested 
by individual employees with 
a passion for various causes.“Through the year,” says Stutzki, “we 
average one fund raiser a month 
at the facility. One month it’s for a 
Suicide Prevention organization in 
Camanche, Iowa; the next month 
we’re helping to buy food for a food 
shelf in Fulton, Illinois. Around the 
holidays we have a sharing tree that 
inspires employees to buy gifts for 
children in families who can’t afford 
to buy them on their own. Projects 
like this are happening all the time, 
in addition to year-long volunteer 
efforts by many employees.” 
“In a way, supporting our 
communities is a lot like addressing 
Sustainability issues in our facility,” 
says Parent. “Our people are 
always looking for ways to make 
things better for the community. 
Whether it is improving our 
Sustainability performance, 
volunteering for local charitable 
organizations, or getting active in 
their communities in a number of 
ways, like coaching or volunteering 
with local fire departments.”

Raw materials  
The world’s population  
is growing larger, living longer — 
and consuming more. With this 
increased pressure on our finite 
natural resources and materials, 
we must move beyond low-cost, 
recyclable materials to renewable 
products. Companies that address 
this issue not only help the 
planet, they gain a competitive 
advantage in the marketplace.
Improving raw material usage 
through product design and 
operational considerations provides 
benefits throughout the supply 
chain in material use, energy, 
and transportation efficiency.
We will continue to innovate into 
the future, developing renewable 
alternatives for impacted resources, 
revolutionizing recyclable materials, 
and becoming more sustainable.Water
People consume it, farm with it, 
and manufacture products with 
it. Reducing water consumption 
and improving water quality are 
important elements of water 
stewardship. Aging infrastructure 
and increased demand must 
be addressed to assure socially 
equitable, environmentally 
sustainable, and economically 
beneficial use and treatment  
of water.
Some of our customers are finding 
it difficult to source or deliver clean, 
accessible water. We help them 
solve this problem by developing 
technology that increases water 
efficiencies and improves quality.
We will continue to work to reduce 
our corporate water footprint 
and offer products that enhance 
water quality, respecting and

Access to a dependable energy 
supply directly affects all 
businesses and communities. 
From air emissions to fossil 
fuels, 3M takes a proactive 
and collaborative approach 
to addressing energy demand 
and climate change — in our 
operations and for our customers. 
Energy usage and climate concerns 
require systemic change, and we’re 
here to help drive that forward. 
Partnering with our customers will 
help us understand their needs and 
address those needs. The issues 
surrounding effective use of energy 
resources and climate change are 
complex and interconnected. 
We will continue to seek 
solutions that promote energy 
conservation, clean energy 
infrastructure, and reductions 
in greenhouse gas emissions. Health and safety
Global health and safety issues 
are prevalent in workplaces 
around the world. Governments, 
corporations, and consumers are 
driving global demand for safety, 
protection, health care, and 
food safety solutions. Creative 
innovation, technology, education, 
and collaboration are all critical if 
we are to tackle these human health 
and workplace safety concerns.
For decades, 3M has had entire 
business divisions focused on 
creating products and services 
for human health, protection, 
security, and safety. We are

3M 2019 Sustainability Report
56Our actions
Along our journey, we seek internal 
and external input on top social, 
economic, and environmental 
global challenges. We utilize this 
information to inform both our 
reporting and strategic planning. 
As a science-based company, we 
include among our stakeholders 
customers and consumers, 
investors, government agencies, 
industry organizations, subject-
matter experts and academia, 
non-government organizations, 
and other corporations.
Stakeholder 
engagement
3M’s stakeholder engagement 
strategy on priority focus areas 
continues to evolve. We continually 
look to our stakeholders to help us 
increase understanding, broaden 
our awareness, seek technical 
input and expertise, and evaluate 
possible collaborations and 
strategic partnerships. We rely on 
their counsel and expertise to help 
guide us. We believe stakeholder 
engagement should be based on 
candid and authentic dialogue — 
grounded in the company’s values 
— and should contribute to the 
evolution of our strategic priorities.Levels of engagement with 
stakeholders vary greatly by 
geography, type, and function. For 
example, 3M employees globally 
are engaged frequently through 
Sustainability communications 
and events with diverse content 
based on our materiality topics.
Materiality 
assessment
In 2014, 2016, and 2018, 3M 
commissioned GlobeScan, an 
independent research consultancy, 
to assist us in better understanding 
our stakeholders’ perspectives 
of key issues, and assessing 
our corporate reputation and 
leadership opportunities. 
Through an in-depth interview 
process conducted for the 2018 
assessment, stakeholders shared 
their short (0 to 1 year), medium (1 
to 5 years), and long-term (10-plus 
years) expectations for 3M. As 
part of the process, they revisited 
top focus areas identified in 2016 
compared with current areas.
Stakeholders included in the 
comparative assessment were 
academia, consultants, customers, 
governmental/regulatory agencies, 
group purchasing organizations, 
non-government organizations (NGOs), trade unions, 3M retirees, 
and non-3M private-sector 
businesses. At the same time, 
3M conducted a similar process 
through an internal online employee 
survey. Following completion 
of the interviews, GlobeScan 
analyzed insights and inputs from 
the stakeholders to develop our 
evidence-based focus area matrix.
From this matrix, 3M and the 
readers of this report can 
understand stakeholder 
expectations of the degree of 
importance our stakeholders place 
on each issue, the ability of 3M to 
make a positive difference on the 
issue, and the level of impact an 
issue may have on our reputation. 
Past, present, and 
future focus areas
From our 2018 assessment, the top 
focus areas for stakeholders center 
around climate change, waste from 
operations, fresh-water shortages, 
energy use, human rights, and the 
reduction of toxic substances. Most 
of these focus areas were perceived 
to have increased in importance 
since 2016, along with scarcity of 
raw materials, water quality, social 
equality, and ethical business.
The feedback from this assessment was incorporated into our 
consideration for our Strategic 
Sustainability Framework, 
milestones, and actions as we 
continue to evolve and advance 
our company purpose. Moving 
forward, we will continue a 
consistent rhythm to produce a 
comprehensive third-party focus 
area (materiality) assessment. 
Data provided in this report includes 
information on issues that were 
found through this assessment 
to have the highest potential to 
impact our reputation and that are 
of great importance to internal and 
external stakeholders. Because 
we are a diversified company, 
several other environment-related 
topics and performance indicators 
relevant to various sectors of the 
company are also included in the 
report. 3M’s Science, Technology, 
and Sustainability Committee 
reviews, approves, and assures 
material topics are covered in 
our Sustainability Report.
All material aspects defined 
within this report are deemed 
material for all entities within 
the 3M organization. The 
prioritization for the different 
aspects may vary within 3M 
operations and geographies, 
but they are still material.Global challenges

Membership and 
partnership 
External engagements and 
collaboration efforts on priority 
focus areas help provide us with 
diverse viewpoints, a better 
understanding of the positions of 
our stakeholders, and a mechanism 
to learn from the successes and 
failures of our peers, all of which 
contribute to our commitment 
to purpose-driven business.
As part of GlobeScan’s 2018 
interview process, a series 
of questions were framed on 
engagement tactics to better 
communicate with relevant 
stakeholders. From these 
interviews, we learned stakeholders 
mention a variety of groups to 
prioritize, including customers/
consumers, local communities, 
investors, government agencies, 
and NGOs. In addition, they 
preferred communication that 
is simple, intuitive, and easy 
to understand such as this 
report, blogs, and new releases. 
This aligns with our current 
engagement practices.The world around us is changing 
fast. Waste and resource scarcity 
threaten our natural systems and 
every species. Climate change 
is accelerating and endangers 
everyone’s well-being. People 
around the world will need to 
come together to create a more 
positive future in which everyone 
can thrive. More than ever, we 
need science. The resilience 
of our planet, our people, and 
our economy depends on it.
We believe we can help, and this 
is our purpose. That is why we are 
committed to three priority areas 
— Science for Circular, Science 
for Climate, and Science for 
Community — and it is why we are 
reinventing the products, processes, 
and systems that will improve 
every life. We are transforming 
our business and putting science 
to work for the greater good. Stakeholder key focus areas

Who we are
60 61Our 
commitment
We have been setting global 
environmental goals at 3M 
since 1990. A strong part of our 
company history, these goals 
have helped dramatically reduce 
our own environmental footprint 
and established us as a leader 
in environmental stewardship. 
Stakeholders increasingly expect 
companies to do things that benefit 
society in more direct ways and 
are not solely focused on benefits 
to the company. That is why we 
made such an active effort to 
involve stakeholders when we 
developed our 2025 Sustainability 
Goals. These goals go well beyond 
advancing our environmental 
stewardship efforts. They are 
framed around global challenges. This is apparent when one considers 
how well our goals align with the 
United Nations 2030 agenda for 
Sustainable Development released 
in 2015. This agenda, including 
17 sustainable development 
goals (SDGs), is designed to build 
upon the historic work of the 
Millennium Development Goals 
and stimulate important action in 
three dimensions of sustainable 
development: economic, 
social, and environmental.
We set our goals with the 
perspective that we have to 
succeed as a company while also 
supporting the communities where 
we operate. It’s a two-pronged 
approach that is both practical 
and thoughtful — and filled with 
the integrity 3M is known for.Our view of Sustainability is 
about finding those intersections 
where our goals move us forward 
toward growth while supporting 
the company Vision to advance, 
enhance, and improve.
Sustainability at 3M also includes 
collaborating to find better 
solutions for customers. The way 
we see it, global challenges must 
be addressed together to assure 
we can all live healthy, fulfilling 
lives. That’s why we are committed 
to partnering with customers to 
identify and collaborate on solutions 
to help them address their goals.2025

Our actions
Empowering the next 
generation
3M empowers the next generation 
of scientists and engineers 
by supporting education 
initiatives that advance equitable 
outcomes in STEM and business 
for underrepresented and 
underresourced students.Community training resources.
As manufacturing evolves and 
companies like 3M invest in 
facilities of the future, it is essential 
that our local technical schools 
and high schools get access to 
appropriate technologies and 
training. Here are three programs 
3Mgives is investing in to help keep 
the workforce pipeline flowing: 
•  The 3M Manufacturing and 
Academic Partnership (MAP) 
program provides manufacturing 
equipment, teacher training, and 
student scholarships through 
partnerships with high schools and 
technical colleges in communities 
where we operate. In 2018, we 
supported 30 high schools, 
10 community and technical 
colleges, and we provided nearly 
50 scholarships. For additional 
information on one effort, see here . 
•  Since 2013, 3Mgives has helped 
to close the workforce gap across 
many industries around the world 
by supporting WorldSkills™ 
and SkillsUSA, two programs 
that provide forward-thinking 
educational programs, events, and 
competitions. More on skilled trade 
development can be found: here .•  3M has been a sponsor of the 
Society of Women Engineers (SWE) 
for many years and upped our 
support in 2018 when thousands 
of female professionals, students, 
and educators from across the 
U.S. convened in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota, at the year’s largest 
gathering for women in engineering 
and technology — the SWE 
Annual Conference. Close to 100 
3M employees from all over the 
country attended, and many spoke 
on panels during the event. A 3M 
grant of $100,000 went toward the 
conference, including professional 
development programs for college 
students and working engineers.

academic support initiatives: here .
A science curriculum for teachers.
Teachers are the most important 
school-related factor in influencing 
student achievement. That is 
why, for 34 years, 3M TWIST 
(Teachers Working in Science and 
Technology) has been one of 3M’s 
signature science encouragement 
programs, helping teachers 
gain practical knowledge of 
scientific concepts to enhance 
students’ classroom experience. 
Since 1984, 3M has helped 40 
teachers improve their classroom 
instruction by providing an annual opportunity to experience science 
in 3M labs and manufacturing 
facilities and discover the ways 
we apply that science to real life.

In addition, 3M Community 
Vibrancy Grants promote 
economic development, youth 
development, or access to diverse 
arts programming for underserved 
populations. For example: In 
Michigan, 3M Detroit provided 
a grant supporting the Matrix 
Human Service’s Osborn Youth 
Employment Initiative. According 
to a recent American Community 
Survey, Detroit’s poverty rate of and flooding in Trinidad and 
Tobago, California wildfires, and 
hurricanes Florence and Michael 
in the southeastern U.S. To 
support communities impacted, 
3M provided cash and product 
donations valued at more than $1.94 
million to humanitarian aid partners 
including American Red Cross, 
Direct Relief and MAP International.
Big challenges met.  
Product donations can be especially 
critical in times of disaster by 
enabling relief organizations to

Global community investmentsWhile our international and 
U.S. giving efforts share a 
common philosophy, our support 
for international programs 
stands out in two ways:
•  Support for international 
programs originating in the U.S. is 
conducted through intermediary 
organizations based in the 
U.S. that have global reach
•  Subsidiaries have local community 
engagement programs 
focused on social concerns 
specific to their locations
Our international approach is 
evolving to expand our reach and 
build local ownership. Our goal 
is to increase international cash 
giving (comprising 3Mgives cash 
investments and subsidiary cash 
investments) to 25 percent of 
total 3M cash giving by 2020.
Throughout 2019, 3M will add 
depth and direction to the Strategic 
Sustainability Framework, including 
Science for Community.

Who we are
72 73Employee 
diversity and 
inclusion
A culture that thrives because of, 
not in spite of, our differences.  Employee diversity and inclusion
and harassment, but it involves 
more than compliance with the law. 
It is a work environment that is free 
of inappropriate or unprofessional 
behavior and consistent with 
3M’s ethics and values — a place 
where all employees can do 
their best, and are free to report 
workplace concerns without 
fear of retaliation or reprisal.”
To foster this kind of workplace, 
we follow our Equal Employment 
Opportunity (EEO) policies, which 
prohibit all forms of discrimination 
or harassment against applicants, 
employees, vendors, contractors, 
or customers on the basis of race, 
color, creed, religion, sex, national 
origin, age, disability, veteran’s 
status, pregnancy, genetic 
information, sexual orientation, 
marital status, citizenship status, 
status with regards to public 
assistance, gender identity/
expression, or any other reason 
prohibited by law. Our affirmative 
action policies and programs 
are designed to assure equal 
opportunities for qualified 
minorities, women, covered 
veterans, and individuals with 
disabilities, and also to provide 
reasonable accommodation to 
individuals with disabilities.2025 Goal: Double 
the pipeline of diverse 
talent in management 
to build a diverse 
workforce.
Increasing diversity in every region 
in which we operate is a core part of 
our Sustainability strategy. Doubling 
our diverse talent in management 
positions will ultimately help build 
a diverse pipeline for executive 
leadership as well. That said, we 
recognize that definitions of 
diversity vary between countries 
and cultures. The 3M definition 
of diversity includes gender, race/
ethnicity, nationality, people with 
disabilities, U.S. military veterans, 
and people who identify as 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
questioning, and intersex (LGBTQI). 
To measure progress against our 
2025 goal, we use the 3M Diversity 
Index, which represents the total 
number of diverse future leaders 
within the company globally. 
In the U.S. and in many other 
countries, we provide our 
people with the opportunity 
to opt in to the index research 
and confidentially provide 
information such as disability 
status, veteran status, sexual 
orientation, and race/ethnicity.Our 
commitment
How do we become the most 
inclusive enterprise we can be? It’s 
about attracting top talent around 
the world. That understanding 
leads to a much more diverse 3M, a 
stronger 3M, a more creative 3M, 
higher-performing 3M. Diversity 
and inclusion are the foundation 
of our Value Model. Our Value  
Model  comprises the actions we 
take that make us unique among 
companies and differentiate us in 
our marketplace.
The way we look at it, a diverse, 
global workforce — people with 
different experience, ethnicity, 
age, gender, sexual orientation, 
personalities, styles, and ways of 
thinking — helps us relate more 
closely to the needs of all 3M customers, suppliers, and channel 
partners around the world.
Just as important, we know that 
inclusion is the key to unlocking 
the power of diversity. An inclusive 
culture is one that supports 
and appreciates differences 
and provides fair and equal 
opportunities for everyone — a 
culture where people realize they 
are respected for their whole 
and unique selves, and that 
they belong. Inclusion leads to 
engagement, which in turn fosters 
the collaboration, creativity, and 
innovation that drive long-term 
growth, for 3M as well as for 
our people and our teams. 
Above all, creating a culture that 
supports diversity and inclusion 
is the right thing to do. Diversity 
and inclusion are about creating 
intellectual and emotional oxygen 
for all people to flourish and feel comfortable to collaborate, 
agree, disagree, and respectfully 
exchange, learn, and create.
Our Code of Conduct is what 
it means to be a 3M employee. 
And that code includes the 3M 
Respectful Workforce Principle .
Be Respectful: We strive to have a 
work environment that reflects and 
values the best in all of us, where 
we treat each other respectfully 
and professionally, and where 
individual differences are valued. 
3M’s Respectful Workplace 
Principle  states that “everyone is 
entitled to respectful treatment 
in the 3M workplace. Being 
respectful means being treated 
honestly and professionally, with 
each person’s unique talents, 
background, and perspectives 
valued. A respectful workplace is 
free from unlawful discrimination To date, we have made 5.7 percent 
progress toward this goal, moving 
from 32.6 percent to 38.3 percent.
Our actions
Every day, we work to assure that 
the 3M workforce is representative 
of the people with whom we do 
business. This entails strengthening 
3M’s reputation as a great place 
for diverse people to work: 
•  Seeking and attracting diverse and 
qualified candidates globally 
•  Building our global pipeline 
of diverse candidates 
Beyond our day-to-day efforts 
to support diversity in 2018, we 
also actively promoted initiatives 
to engage our people, attract the 
best talent, and make everyone 
feel safe and included.

Global Service Center in the 
Philippines, employees participated 
in a problem-solving activity using 
tangram puzzles.
To maintain the momentum of the 
“Different minds inspire” campaign 
through 2018, 3M took it steps 
further: 
Learning the 
score with sports 
management leaders
Curiosity and collaboration 
are a powerful combination in 
business. To delve into what it 
takes to collaborate effectively, 
the Diversity and Inclusion team, 
along with the WLF and the Men 
as Advocates group, conducted 
a special event in June of 2018: strengths of others helped them 
set their teams up for success. 
Connect: Understand and 
appreciate the unique 
perspectives of others .
Seeking insights and perspectives 
from others allows one to learn 
from their experiences and 
increases appreciation for other 
viewpoints. One such event, World 
Day for Cultural Diversity held 
on May 21, honored diversity 
of our people and customers, 
recognized the importance of 
intercultural collaboration in 
solving today’s challenges, and 
encouraged 3M employees to 
deepen their understanding and 
appreciation of other cultures.
Wonder: Imagine what we 
can accomplish together.
Understanding and valuing the 
dreams, needs, and desires of 
others fuels our ambition to solve 
pressing challenges together. For 
instance, on Wonder Day, 
September 21, surfboard artist 
Drew Brophy visited 3M Center in 
St. Paul to paint a series of five 
surfboards with artistic 
representations of how each of the 
five 3M business groups improves 
lives, using many 3M products in been done to date and, at the same 
time, noticed that there is still more 
to be accomplished. To further our 
journey in 2018, 3M established 
U.S. and global inclusion teams 
to help fortify our culture of 
inclusion and drive improvement 
in their individual organizations’ 
Inclusion Index results. 
As part of the “Different minds 
inspire” campaign, we focused 
on communicating around three 
actions each of us can take 
to support inclusion: Reflect, 
Connect, and Wonder.
Reflect: Identify your own 
unique strengths.
Focusing on and understanding 
one’s own talents, skills, and 
perspectives makes us who we are 
and enables us to determine how 
we can make a difference — and 
helps us recognize the talents 
others have to offer, too. For 
instance, on March 8, partnering 
with the Women’s Leadership 
Forum (WLF) on International 
Women’s Day, participants 
were invited to discover their 
unique strengths in a two-part 
event held at the 3M Center in 
St. Paul, Minnesota. The day 
included a panel of 3M leaders 
revealing how appreciating the initiative, joining more than 50 
CEOs and industry leaders who 
also have made personal pledges 
to accelerate gender equality and 
inclusion in their organizations. 
“3M is honored to be part of 
Catalyst CEO Champions for 
Change,” said Roman. “Diversity 
and inclusion is one of our core 
business strategies because 
we know that championing a 
diverse and inclusive global 
team helps us better serve our 
customers and build an even 
stronger 3M. Advancing inclusive 
leadership advances us all.”
Different minds 
inspire
The central thread of 3M 
diversity and inclusion efforts 
is our “Different minds inspire” 
campaign. Initiated in 2017, this 
campaign continually confirms our 
inclusive culture, which supports 
and appreciates differences 
and provides fair and equal 
opportunities for everyone. In 
its inaugural year, the 3M Global 
Inclusion Index (a baseline measure 
of how included employees feel in 
the workplace) was created based 
on responses to questions in the 3M 
Standard Opinion Survey. We see 
that as an endorsement of what’s Employee diversity and inclusion
“Navigating Your Professional 
Career: A Conversation with 
Minnesota Vikings Executives.” 
The event opened with a keynote 
address by 3M leader Joaquin 
Delgado, Executive Vice President 
of the Consumer Business Group 
and Executive Sponsor of the 
WLF. This was followed by a 
presentation by two leaders of the 
Minnesota Vikings NFL football 
management team, who spoke 
about their career experiences in 
professional sports and beyond.
Global Inclusion Day
We turned science inward to 
explore how inclusion affects 
the brain and body, and how 
these results, in turn, can shape 
our culture as part of our Global 
Inclusion Day, a day devoted to 
looking at the science of inclusion 
— the inherent connection 
between inclusive behaviors, 
biology, and well-being.
Connecting and 
inspiring Minnesota’s 
business leaders
On August 10, 3M welcomed 
Governor Mark Dayton and 
diversity and inclusion leaders 
from public and private Minnesota companies, including Best Buy, 
General Mills, Medtronic, Target, 
and US Bank to share best practices 
for bolstering diversity and 
inclusion in the workplace. This 
“Different minds inspire” event gave 
employers a chance to share their 
successes, ideas, and challenges 
as Minnesota seeks to build a 
workforce that better reflects and 
includes the rich diversity of its 
people. The state of Minnesota 
and 3M hope these partnerships 
extend into the future, cultivating 
a network across Minnesota that 
will allow leaders to continually 
learn from each other’s successes. 
Employee Resource 
Networks 
3M Employee Resource Networks 
(ERNs) are nine organizations 
designed to nurture leadership skills 
and collaboration across cultures, 
lifestyles, and genders through 
events and activities as they align to 
their mission. Open to all employees, 
these organizations help 3M recruit, 
engage, and retain diverse talent and 
work with our businesses to provide 
relevant customer insights that 
can expand our marketplace reach.

Best Places to Work 
for Disability Inclusion
Representing people with 
disabilities is an important 
dimension of 3M’s Sustainability 
goal to double the pipeline of 
diverse talent in management by 
2025. To that end, we earned a top 
score of 100 percent on the 2018 
Disability Equality Index®, making us 
one of the “Best Places to Work for 
Disability Inclusion.” Participating 
in this index helps us identify 
ways we can further enhance 
our policies and practices around 
disability inclusion. It's part of our 
commitment to be an inclusive 
culture and workplace where 
people of all abilities can thrive.New and continuing 
support for those  
who serve
3M has expanded paid leave 
benefits for military training, 
doubling coverage from two weeks 
to four weeks each calendar year. 
This policy change will help 3M 
employees in the National Guard or 
Reserve units meet their increasing 
training requirements in support 
of our nation. Eligible employees 
on leave for annual encampment 
or training may be entitled to 
differential pay for the difference 
between their 3M pay and their 
military pay. For additional details 
on this policy enhancement, click  
here  to access the Paid Leave 
Policy for Military Training.
3M strives to be the premier 
company for the military 
community and this policy change 
reflects our commitment to 
veterans and the mission of the 
Military Support Network (MSN). 
The MSN provides active support 
and outreach, reoccurring 
professional development, 
and focused veteran hiring 
services to current 3M military 
veterans, their families, and other 
military members seeking to 
join 3M. If you are interested in ERN Community 
Champions and grants
Our nine ERNs, in partnership 
with 3Mgives, created the ERN 
Community Champions program 
in 2018. This program, launched 
on 3M Community Champions 
Service Day (October 4), connected 
the ERNs to the faces, voices, 
and dreams of the community 
impacted by two societal 
inequities: education disparity 
and homelessness. ERN members 
traveled into the community and 
engaged experts who helped 
them better understand current 
and desired situation dynamics 
within these two inequities. 
Domestic partner 
benefits 
At 3M, diversity and inclusion is 
the cornerstone of our organization 
and essential to innovation. This 
is why 3M now offers benefits for 
eligible opposite-sex and same-sex 
domestic partners of employees, 
and their eligible dependents. As 
part of its work, the Diversity and 
Inclusion team invited employees 
to learn more about domestic 
partner benefits, eligibility, available 
coverages, costs, tax considerations, 
and dependent certification, and 
were able to enroll for 2019 benefits.Current progress and opportunity – racial, ethnic diversity

  How we work Introduction
Just as Sustainability is embedded 
throughout our Value Model, 
sustainable thinking is embedded 
firmly at the core of 3M and in 
the strategic planning process 
we use for every region, every 
market, and every business.
In each of our business groups 
and regions we have dedicated 
Sustainability leaders who develop 
a relevant and well-informed 
strategy specific to their market 
demands and business goals.
Annually, like many companies, 
we go through a strategic 
planning process during which 
our divisions and regions develop 
their business strategies for the 
next few years. However, unlike 
others, we formally require that 
each plan address Sustainability 
factors relevant to their market 
needs and business opportunities.
First, the "R". Scientists in our 
central laboratory are free to 
focus on pure research, in search 
of unscripted, unexpected 
opportunities for breakthroughs. 
Our unique “15% Culture” gives them the freedom to follow their 
instincts. At the same time, our 
Tech Forum is a key enabler of 
collaboration. This self-directed, 
self-organized group unites 
10,000-plus scientists and 
engineers who work together to 
solve problems across oceans 
and continents, regardless of 
which business they’re from.
For the "D", 3M development teams 
within each of our business groups 
draw upon our core technologies 
to create products for targeted 
markets and geographies.
Moving forward, we will continue 
to expand beyond our own 
operations and focus more on 
3M Sustainability goals and the 
needs of our customers and 
communities. While we recognize 
the importance of what we do 
in our own businesses, and will 
continue to innovate there, we 
see that far greater impact can 
be realized when we partner to 
understand and overcome the 
challenges we face together.R&D at 3M is a little different: 
We separate the R and the D.
86Sustainable 
thinking is 
embedded 
firmly at the 
core of 3M. innovation, commercial 
transformation, manufacturing 
and supply chain transformation, 
and people and culture.
Our long-term strategy is outlined 
in the 3M Value Model.  The 3M 
Value Model is what differentiates 
our company in the marketplace. 
It’s how we create extraordinary 
value for customers, and premium 
returns for shareholders. The model 
is built around four elements: our 
Vision, our strengths, our priorities, 
and our Values.  Additional 
details can be found earlier in this 
report under 3M Value Model .
Lobbying and Political 
Activities Principle
As a concerned member of 
our communities, 3M actively 
participates in public policy and 
legislative advocacy, or “lobbying.” 
As appropriate, 3M also participates 
in political activities to elect and 
work with elected representatives 
and government officials. 3M’s 
Government Affairs organization 
coordinates and oversees 3M’s 
lobbying and political activities. 
3M Political Activities Board, 
which is made up of senior 3M 
executives, oversees 3M’s political 
contributions and the activities of

How we work
3M believes that good corporate 
governance practices serve the 
long-term interests of stockholders, 
strengthen the Board and 
management, and further enhance 
the public trust 3M has earned from 
more than a century of operating 
with uncompromising integrity 
and doing business the right way.confusion regarding the Board’s 
oversight responsibilities and 
the day-to-day management 
of business operations.
The Board plans the succession 
to the position of Chairman/CEO 
and other senior management 
positions. To assist the Board, the 
Chairman/CEO and senior vice 
president of human resources 
annually assess senior managers 
and their succession potential for 
the position of Chairman/CEO 
and other senior management 
positions. As a result of a thorough 
and thoughtful succession planning 
process, on March 5, 2018, the 
Board appointed Michael F. 
Roman CEO, effective July 1, 
2018, succeeding Inge G. Thulin.
Board’s role in the 
company’s long-term 
strategy 
Each year management presents to 
the Board, and the Board discusses 
and approves, detailed long-term 
strategic plans for the company. In 
addition to the overall strategic plan 
for 3M and the business groups, 
the discussions also focused on 
breakout sessions with the directors 
on strategic corporate-wide 
themes of portfolio management, Our 
commitment
Our corporate governance 
principles govern how we do 
business daily, enabling us to 
outperform and lead the way to 
sustainable growth. They provide 
a framework that defines the 
roles, rights, and responsibilities 
of different groups within the 
organization, the Board’s role 
in risk oversight, public policy 
engagement, and 3M’s commitment 
to the environment and society. 
3M’s Board of Directors oversees 
the CEO and senior management 
and assures that appropriate 
procedures and controls are in place 
covering managements’ activities in 
operating the company on ethical 
grounds on a day-to-day basis.
3M’s Board of Directors has 
adopted  Corporate Governance  
Guidelines  which provide a 
framework for the effective governance of the company. 
The guidelines address matters 
such as the respective roles 
and responsibilities of the 
Board including leadership 
structure, responsibilities of the 
independent Lead Director, director 
independence, membership criteria, 
committees, and management 
evaluation. The Board’s Nominating 
and Governance Committee is 
responsible for overseeing and 
reviewing the guidelines, at least 
annually, and recommending 
proposed changes to the Board 
for approval. The Corporate 
Governance Guidelines, Certificate 
of Incorporation and Bylaws , 
charters of the Board committees, 
Director Independence Guidelines , 
and Board of Directors Code of 
Conduct  provide the framework 
for the governance of the company 
and are available on our website 
at www.3M.com , under Investor 
Relations — Governance . The Board’s current leadership 
structure is characterized by:
•  A combined Chairman of 
the Board and CEO
•  A strong, independent, and highly 
experienced Lead Director with well-
defined responsibilities that support 
the Board’s oversight responsibilities
•  A robust committee structure 
consisting entirely of independent 
directors with oversight of 
various types of risks
• An engaged and independent Board
The Board of Directors believes 
that this leadership structure 
provides independent Board 
leadership and engagement while 
deriving the benefits of having 
our CEO also serve as Chairman 
of the Board. As the individual 
with primary responsibility for 
managing 3M’s day-to-day 
operations and with in-depth 
knowledge and understanding 
of the company, CEO is best 
positioned to chair regular Board 
meetings as the directors discuss 
key business and strategic issues. 
Coupled with an independent Lead 
Director, this combined structure 
provides independent oversight 
while avoiding unnecessary Corporate

How we workCorporate governance
3M’s Political Action Committee 
(3M PAC). 3M PAC is a nonpartisan 
fund comprised of voluntary 
employee and stockholder 
contributions that is used to make 
contributions to U.S. federal, 
state, and local candidates as 
permitted by law.  These activities 
must always comply both with 
applicable laws and 3M’s Lobbying  
and Political Activities Principle . 
Our actions 
Board membership 
criteria
3M’s Corporate Governance 
Guidelines contain Board 
Membership Criteria which include 
a list of key skills and characteristics 
deemed critical to serve 3M’s 
long-term business strategy and 
expected to be represented on 
3M’s Board. The Nominating 
and Governance Committee 
periodically reviews with the 
Board the appropriate skills and 
characteristics required of Board 
members given the current Board 
composition. It is the intent of the 
Board that the Board, itself, will be 
a high-performance organization 
creating competitive advantage for 
the company. To perform as such, 
the Board will be composed of individuals who have distinguished 
records of leadership and success 
in their arena of activity and who 
will make substantial contributions 
to Board operations and effectively 
represent the interests of all 
stockholders. The committee’s 
and the Board’s assessment of 
Board candidates includes, but is 
not limited to, consideration of:
•  Roles in and contributions valuable 
to the business community
•  Personal qualities of leadership, 
character, judgment, and whether the 
candidate possesses and maintains 
throughout service on the Board 
a reputation in the community at 
large of integrity, trust, respect, 
competence, and adherence to 
the highest ethical standards
•  Relevant knowledge and diversity 
of background and experience 
in business, manufacturing, 
technology, finance and accounting, 
marketing, international business, 
government, and other areas; and
•  Whether the candidate is free of 
conflicts and has the time required 
for preparation, participation, 
and attendance at all meetings
In addition to these minimum 
requirements, the committee will also evaluate whether the nominee’s 
skills are complementary to the 
existing Board members’ skills, 
the Board’s needs for particular 
expertise in certain areas, 
and will assess the nominee’s 
impact on Board dynamics, 
effectiveness, and diversity of 
experience and perspectives.
Board refreshment
We regularly add directors 
to infuse new ideas and fresh 
perspectives into the boardroom. 
In the past five years, six new 
independent directors have joined 
our Board. In recruiting directors, 
we focus on how the experience 
and skill set of each individual 
complement those of their fellow 
directors to create a balanced 
board with diverse viewpoints and 
backgrounds, deep expertise, and 
strong leadership experience. 
At the 2019 Annual Meeting, two 
nominees will be standing for 
election to the board for the first 
time. Dr. Dambisa Moyo, who 
joined the Board in August 2018, 
holds a doctorate in economics 
from the University of Oxford and 
has expertise in examining the 
interplay of international business 
and the global economy. Her 
background includes advising companies in their investment 
decisions, capital allocation, and 
risk management. Prior to founding 
Mildstorm LLC, she worked at 
Goldman Sachs in various roles, 
including as an economist, and at 
the World Bank in Washington, D.C. 
The combination of her banking 
and financial services industry 
experience along with her extensive 
knowledge of macroeconomics, 
geopolitics, and global markets 
brings valuable insight to the 3M 
Board. A new nominee, Pamela J. 
Craig, is the retired Chief Financial 
Officer of Accenture plc, a global 
management consulting, technology 
services, and outsourcing company. 
She served as Accenture's CFO 
from 2006 through 2013, following 
her many other leadership roles 
at Accenture during her 34 years 
with the company. Her experience 
as CFO at a global Fortune 500 
company, and her skills in financial, 
audit, risk management, and 
governance matters, adds valuable 
expertise to the 3M Board.
Stockholder 
engagement
We maintain a vigorous stockholder 
engagement program. During 2018, 
members of senior management 
met with a cross-section of 
stockholders owning approximately 36 percent of our outstanding 
shares, or approximately 55 percent 
of our institutional stockholders. 
The meetings included an overview 
of 3M and a discussion of practices 
on corporate governance, including 
Board refreshment and diversity, 
director evaluation, directors’ skills 
matrix, Sustainability, succession 
planning, and Board leadership 
structure.  The feedback from 
these meetings was shared with 
the Board of Directors and helped 
inform the Board on corporate 
governance practices and trends. 
Although stockholder engagement 
is primarily a function of 
management, our lead independent 
director and executive chairman 
attended some of these meetings.
Director 
independence 
The Corporate Governance 
Guidelines and Director 
Independence Guidelines provide 
that independent directors must 
comprise a substantial majority 
of the 3M Board. A director 
is “independent” if the Board 
affirmatively determines that 
the director has no material 
relationship with 3M directly 
or as a partner, shareholder, 
or officer of an organization 
that has a relationship with the company and otherwise meets the 
requirements for independence 
of the listing standards of the 
New York Stock Exchange.  
The independent directors will 
make the Board decisions on 
corporate governance matters.
The Guidelines specify the criteria 
by which the independence of 
our directors will be determined, 
including strict guidelines for 
directors and their immediate 
family members with respect to 
past employment or affiliation 
with 3M or its independent 
registered public accounting firm. 
The Guidelines also prohibit Audit 
and Compensation Committee 
members from having any direct 
or indirect financial relationship 
with the company, and restrict 
both commercial and not-for-profit 
relationships of all directors with 
3M. Directors may not be given 
personal loans or extensions of 
credit by the company, and all 
directors are required to deal 
at arm’s length with 3M and its 
subsidiaries, and to disclose 
any circumstance that might be 
perceived as a conflict of interest.#improvinglives933M 2019 Sustainability Report3M 2019 Sustainability Report

How we workCorporate governance
Diversity
For 3M, diversity, in its myriad 
manifestations, is fundamental 
to innovation, performance, 
and relevancy. 3M employees 
reflect that diversity. The Board 
of Directors regards diversity as 
an important factor in selecting 
Board nominees to serve on 
the Board. Although the Board 
has no specific diversity policy, 
when selecting nominees, it 
actively considers diversity in 
recruitment and nomination of 
directors, such as gender, race, 
and national origin. The current 
composition of our Board reflects 
those efforts and the importance 
of diversity to the Board.
An inclusive culture at 3M is built 
on our Be Respectful Principles  
— to respect the dignity and 
worth of individuals; encourage 
the initiative of each employee; 
challenge individual capabilities; 
and provide equal opportunity. 3M 
is continuously focusing on building 
and maintaining an inclusive culture. 
Additional information on our 
inclusive culture can be found in 
the diversity and inclusion section .Governance actions 
Our committees are designed 
to assure the execution of 3M’s 
vision for the future. The Board 
currently has 13 directors and 
the following four committees 
following their charter: Audit , 
Compensation , Finance , and 
Nominating and Governance . 
During 2018, the Board of Directors 
held eight meetings. Overall 
attendance at Board and committee 
meetings was 97 percent.
Commitment 
to economic, 
environmental, and 
social topics
At 3M, we are purpose-driven 
enterprise. We know that we 
can grow our business, while 
collaborating to solve some of 
humanity’s greatest challenges.
We apply our expertise and 
technology to solve problems 
collaboratively, and with a focus 
on long-term, sustainable solutions 
that demonstrate our commitment 
and societal purpose. Sustainability

team was highly engaged and 
involved in its development and 
remains increasingly engaged 
in the resulting innovations and

How we work Enterprise risk
Enterprise risk
We continually evaluate our 
approach to potential risks facing 
the company.
Our 
commitment
The concept of risk appetite 
and tolerance is an essential 
component of our strategic 
planning, and it’s the responsibility 
of our senior business leaders 
to plan accordingly.
It is our firm belief that good 
corporate governance practices 
serve the long-term interests 
of stockholders, strengthen 
3M’s Board of Directors and 
management, and further enhance 
the public trust 3M has earned 
from more than a century of 
operating with uncompromising 
integrity and doing business 
the right way. Governance 
includes broad risk oversight by 
the Board and its committees. 
Risk analysis is reported to the 
full Board, the General Auditor, 
and Chief Compliance Officer. 
Both the General Auditor and 
Chief Compliance Officer are thorough assessment for their 
respective risk(s). Together, with 
subject-matter experts and senior 
management, the outcomes 
are mapped to demonstrate the 
relative level of risk and likelihood 
of risk. This “heat map” identifies 
the highest-risk areas to focus 
internal efforts on. In addition, 
external resources and data are 
continually reviewed to assist in 
the risk identification process. 
The results of our various risk 
assessment exercises are shared 
with the Corporate Operations 
Committee and the company’s 
full Board of Directors.
3M places particular emphasis on 
protecting our company against 
emerging risks in an ever-changing 
world. Case in point: cybersecurity. 
Strong cybersecurity programs are 
essential, and we continue to invest 
in information technology systems 
and activities around cybersecurity 
training and awareness, especially 
when it comes to avoiding phishing 
and other threats targeting 3M.
Board members and 
general auditor  
meet 1:1
In 2018, the Vice President, General 
Auditor met with each independent appointed by, and report to, the 
Audit Committee of the Board.
Risk oversight 
The Board has delegated primary 
responsibility for the oversight 
of risks facing the company to 
the Audit Committee. The 3M  
Company Board of Directors 
Audit Committee Charter  states 
that the committee will “discuss 
policies and procedures with 
respect to risk assessment and 
risk management, the company’s 
major risk exposures, and the steps 
management has taken to monitor 
and mitigate such exposures.”
The Vice President and General 
Auditor, Corporate Auditing, whose 
appointment and performance 
is reviewed and evaluated by the 
Audit Committee, is responsible for 
leading the formal risk assessment 
and management process within 
the company. The General Auditor, 
consulting with the company’s 
senior management, annually assesses the major risks facing the 
company and works with those 
executives responsible for managing 
each specific risk. The General 
Auditor periodically reviews with 
the Audit Committee the major 
risks facing the company and the 
steps management has taken to 
monitor and mitigate those risks.
While the Board’s oversight of risk 
is primarily performed by the Audit 
Committee, the Board has also 
delegated to other committees  the 
oversight of risks within their areas 
of responsibility and expertise.
We believe this governance of risks 
by Board committees, who share 
information with the full Board, 
is appropriate for a diversified 
technology and manufacturing 
company like 3M. 3M’s 10-K , 
Item 1A , outlines risk factors 
applicable to the company.Our actions 
Corporate-level
3M’s Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) initiative, launched in 2001, 
has helped assure adequate 
recognition and ownership of the 
most significant potential risks to 
the company’s shareholder value, 
using a process that proactively 
identifies and communicates 
enterprise risks within the company. 
This includes confirming that 
appropriate plans and oversight 
exist for all major risks, providing 
for ongoing review and assessment 
of risk, and aiding in generating 
awareness and engagement of 
general risk matters throughout the 
company. The approach provides 
a customized capability that 
leverages 3M’s comprehensive, 
experience-based global knowledge 
and capabilities rather than 
tools often used in financial or 
insurance-oriented businesses.
To assure long-term success, we 
are committed to discovering 
and preparing for all potential 
threats to our Vision . Risk owners 
familiar with the environmental, 
economic, and business aspects 
within the company are interviewed 
and requested to complete a 3M Board member to discuss risk 
management in general as well as 
specific risk-related topics facing 
the company. These meetings gave 
Board members an opportunity to 
share what risk issues were top-of-
mind for them, and which should 
be reviewed and addressed by the 
Board. For most Board members, 
the most critical risk in 2018 and 
into the future was cybersecurity.
Business-level
In 2018, 3M served customers 
through five business groups. 
Annually, leadership from each 
business group presents to the 
Board, and the Board discusses 
and approves, detailed long-term 
strategic plans for the company, 
both at the area and business group 
level. Each presentation includes

Each site is ultimately ranked 
based on the risk it poses to 
the company, and necessary 
steps are taken to minimize 
potential risks. Acquisitions are of 
particular focus as we bring each 
new sight under 3M’s protocol 
with the proper training.
In addition to conducting 
environmental, health, and safety 
risk analysis, we created a crisis 
plan for every single 3M plant in 
the world. Although we hope to 
never use the Crisis Management 
Planning Guidelines, it’s critically 
important that we have them in 
place, keep them up to date, and 
drill employees often to make sure 
everyone understands what to do 
should an emergency occur. We 
care about the safety of our people 
and communities around the world.Enterprise risk

How we work Code of Conduct
Our 
commitment
The Code of Conduct is part of 
3M’s Value Model and positions 
3M for long-term growth. Our 
values bind us together as 3M 
employees — across business 
groups and across geographies. 
Great companies are built on 
trust  — trust from customers, 
shareholders, employees, and 
communities. We’ve earned that 
trust and our reputation for integrity 
over many decades, and no one 
at 3M is free to compromise it. 
To make it as simple as possible, we 
have one Code of Conduct that Global compliance 
program
3M’s global compliance program 
is managed and administered 
by the Compliance and Business 
Conduct Department, led by the 
Chief Compliance Officer and 
Vice President of Compliance 
and Business Conduct. The 
department is staffed with 
compliance professionals 
stationed around the world. The 
Chief Compliance Officer reports 
directly to the Audit Committee 
of the 3M Board of Directors. 
The Audit Committee assists 
the Board in oversight of 3M’s 
legal and regulatory compliance 
efforts. This direct reporting 
line assures the independence 
of the Compliance and Business 
Conduct Department, which is 
responsible for overseeing and 
administering strategic, systemic, 
and operational components 
of 3M’s compliance program. 
The compliance program is 
designed to meet the U.S. Federal 
Sentencing Guidelines and, as 
designed, meets similar global 
standards and requirements of 
other countries’ anti-bribery laws.applies to our 92,000 employees 
in over 70 countries globally. Our 
Code of Conduct summarizes 
3M’s compliance principles 
and raises awareness for doing 
business the right way, always 
and everywhere. The Code is our 
guide for answering questions 
and providing direction when the 
right choice may not be clear.
3M’s Code of Conduct 
defines how we work:
Be Good 
Be Honest 
Be Fair
Be Loyal
Be Accurate
Be Respectful3M employees, including all 
supervisors, managers, and 
other leaders, are responsible for 
knowing and following the ethical, 
legal, and policy requirements that 
apply to their jobs and for reporting 
any suspected violations of law or 
the Code. Executives and managers 
are accountable for creating an 
inclusive workplace environment 
that encourages asking questions 
and raising concerns.
The Code is available in 
25 languages and sets clear 
expectations not only for 
employees, but also for relevant 
stakeholders and business 
partners. All new employees 
receive a copy of the Code.
Business Conduct 
Committee
The 3M Business Conduct 
Committee is composed of several 
senior executives and is chaired 
by 3M’s Chief Compliance Officer. 
This committee oversees 3M’s 
compliance efforts to assure that 
3M has an effective and world-
class compliance program that 
is agile and anticipates changes 
in the external landscape and 
internal business strategy. The 
Business Conduct Committee, as 
appropriate, updates the Audit  
Committee of the 3M Board of 
Directors and Corporate Operating 
Committee. Additionally, similar 
committees exist at country or 
regional levels to operationalize and 
prioritize compliance activities.  The program consists of:
•  A core set of business 
conduct principles
• Education and training
•  Periodic evaluations, audits, 
and procedures to measure 
and assess the compliance 
program’s effectiveness
•  A 24-hour global helpline and 
website through which all 
employees and others can report 
concerns and ask questions 
anonymously, in most countries 
•  Risk-based due diligence on business 
partners, potential acquisitions, and 
candidates for hiring and promoting
• Investigation expertise
•  Incentives and discipline to address 
compliance successes and failures
Compliance training 
and education
3M offers a comprehensive online 
compliance training program 
to all employees worldwide.
The program’s training modules are 
assigned to employees based on 
their role and area of responsibility #improvinglives1033M 2019 Sustainability Report3M 2019 Sustainability Report

How we workCode of Conduct
within the company. Most courses 
are mandatory for approximately 
46,000 global employees. An 
annual training plan is established 
each year based on an assessment 
of internal and external factors 
to prioritize topics and timing of 
deployment. Online courses are 
offered in 22 languages. Examples 
of recent training modules include:
•  Data Privacy and Protection: 
The Real World
• Security and Protection
• Gifts, Entertainment, and Travel
•  Avoiding Bribery and Corruption: 
A Global Overview
• Understanding Global Competition
•  Creating a Harassment-
Free Workplace
•  Code of Conduct and Ethical 
Decision Making
• Recognizing Conflict of Interest
The Compliance and Business 
Conduct website on 3M’s intranet 
offers additional on-demand 
online training courses. In addition 
to offering online training, the 
Compliance and Business Conduct Department — in close 
collaboration with 3M Legal Affairs, 
local compliance contacts, finance, 
and human resources — provides 
frequent, tailored in-person training 
to businesses, subsidiaries, staff 
groups, and third parties. Some 
of this training occurs as part of 
an annual schedule, and other 
training occurs as requested 
or deemed appropriate.
Reporting concerns 
Upholding 3M’s Code of Conduct 
and values is the responsibility of 
everyone acting on 3M’s behalf. 
We encourage our employees to 
ask questions or report concerns to 
management, 3M’s Compliance and 
Business Conduct Department, 3M 
Legal Counsel, 3MEthics.com , their 
assigned human resource manager, 
3M Corporate Audit Department, 
or the Audit Committee of the 
Board of Directors. Our strong 
ethical culture requires and 
empowers employees to make 
the right choices every day. 3M 
makes it clear that speaking up is 
the right thing to do. We know our 
employees care about the company 
and want to do the right thing.  
In addition, 3MEthics.com is a 24-
hour confidential and anonymous 
(where permitted by local law) helpline and online reporting 
system. It is managed by a third-
party vendor and is available to 3M 
employees and others externally. 
The system does not trace phone 
calls or use caller identification, nor 
does it generate or maintain internal 
connection logs containing internet 
protocol (IP) addresses. Web-based 
reports are made through a secure 
internet portal, which does not 
trace or show user screen names. 
The Compliance and Business 
Conduct Department has the 
responsibility to review every 
business conduct concern that 
is reported. After review, the 
department determines which 
reports require an investigation. 
If an investigation is needed, an 
appropriate investigation resource 
is assigned to the matter. For 
concerns that are substantiated, 
disciplinary actions may be taken. 
Discipline comes in a range of 
forms consistent with similar 
past violations, from warnings, 
to suspensions, to termination. 
Disciplinary actions may impact one 
or more persons associated with a 
single substantiated violation. The 
"Global allegations and disciplinary 
action graph" illustrates business 
conduct related reports raised 
in 2018, using our reporting 
tools found at 3MEthics.com.In 2018, we initiated a project to 
incorporate metrics from a broader 
range of 3M functions that conduct 
investigations and track employee 
concerns. This provides a more 
complete view of the frequency 
and type of concerns reported 
globally and better reflects the 
“speak-up” culture that exists within 
3M. This data is used to prioritize 
resources and focus strategies.  
“Speak up” poster
3M encourages all employees to 
“Speak up” to raise a concern or 
suspected violation of the Code. 
In 2018, we created a poster that 
encompasses many of our most 
frequently used languages and 
encourages our speak-up culture.

3M’s non-retaliation 
process
3M prohibits retaliation against 
anyone who raises a business 
conduct concern or cooperates in a 
company investigation. To monitor 
this risk, a compliance investigator 
contacts the reporter several 
months after an investigation 
closes to discuss if the person has 
experienced any form of retaliation. 
This is done either by phone or via 
email for non-anonymous reporters. For anonymous reporters who 
used 3MEthics to raise a concern, 
the follow-up is handled through 
3MEthics to maintain anonymity. If 
claims of retaliation are identified, 
the investigation team will follow 
up on them. All concerns raised 
are expected to be made in good 
faith. 3M has a strong position 
against retaliation, which is 
reflected in the Non-Retaliation 
Policy and within 3M’s Employee 
Obligations and Reporting Principle. 0400

Assessments
A dedicated team within  
3M’s Compliance and Business 
Conduct Department conducts 
periodic compliance and anti-
bribery evaluations in various 3M 
subsidiaries and operating units 
each year. These evaluations 
are selected using objective and 
subjective risk factors, and include 
reviews of financial transactions, 
compliance records, interviews 
with business personnel, and 
audits of selected third-party 
intermediaries. In 2018, we 
interviewed approximately 900 
non-production employees as 
part of the evaluation process. 
Additionally, the number of third 
parties reviewed or visited through 
an evaluation grew substantially. 
This growth was enabled by an 
enhancement introduced in 2017 
called a local evaluation, which 
uses the same methodology of 
the existing evaluation program 
but has a more focused scope. 
A number of local evaluations 
in 2018 specifically focused on 
third-party business partners.   
Not only do audits, evaluations, 
and risk assessments help detect 
opportunities for improvement 
and gaps in processes or 
procedures, they also reinforce the importance of operating in 
an ethical, compliant manner.
Commitment to  
anti-corruption 
As a member of the United Nations 
Global Compact (UNGC), 3M is 
committed to support Principle 
10 on Anti-Corruption. Our 
commitment and involvement with 
the UNGC, and with our community 
of peer companies, provides us 
with the opportunity to collaborate 
and share best practices related 
to work against corruption in 
all its forms. Additionally, the 
compliance professionals on 
our team regularly participate, 
present, and are members of 
organizations and associations 
working to improve compliance 
controls and reduce legal risk.
3M’s Code requires compliance 
with all applicable anti-bribery laws, 
including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, 
Brazil’s Clean Company Act, and 
local laws where 3M operates. It 
applies to 3M employees, as well as 
to our business partners. In addition, 
3M’s Anti-Bribery Principle and anti-
corruption policies and procedures 
have been communicated to 
all employees. Our “Avoiding Bribery and Corruption: A Global 
Overview” training is required of 
most non-production employees 
and specifically employees in 
higher-risk roles, including those 
in legal, audit, sales, marketing, 
export, and global trading. The 
Chief Compliance Officer provides 
quarterly updates on all activities 
to the Audit Committee of the 
Board of Directors and the 3M 
Business Conduct Committee.
3M’s commitment to anti-corruption 
is also reflected in our management 
of third-party intermediaries 
and other business partners. 3M 
conducts due-diligence reviews 
of our third parties based on an 
assessment of risk factors, including 
transaction size, type of relationship, 
government interactions, and 
geography. Depending on the 
outcome of the review, we 
respond to any identified risks 
with specific actions, such as 
training, inclusion of relevant 
contractual terms, and other risk-
mitigating controls. 3M may end 
a relationship with a business 
partner if the risk presented is 
determined to be too high and 
cannot be appropriately mitigated.
Further, the Compliance and 
Business Conduct Department 
collaborates with 3M Legal Affairs on due-diligence processes related 
to potential venture investments 
and mergers and acquisitions. 
These processes help identify risks 
in the target company before an 
acquisition or investment is initiated. 
This process accelerates our efforts 
to integrate an acquired company’s 
employees to 3M’s compliance 
program and culture. Ultimately, 
the Compliance and Business 
Conduct Department is charged 
with conducting a risk review 
and implementing any necessary 
remediation activities upon the 
closing of every acquisition. In 
2018, as part of our compliance 
integration process, we completed 
a follow-up compliance culture 
survey that was initially piloted 
with an acquisition in 2017. These 
surveys help identify whether 
new employees understand 
3M’s compliance expectations 
and where further assistance 
or training can be provided.
Finally, the Compliance and 
Business Conduct Department 
has a group of specialists 
focused on assuring that 3M 
conducts government contract 
and subcontractor business 
in compliance with all laws. 
This group trains, assists, and 
coaches 3M employees on all 
government contracting needs, including providing guidance 
and advice on identifying, 
managing, and mitigating risk.
Political values
3M respects our employees’ right 
to engage in the political process, 
and, at the same time, 3M is 
committed to prevent potential 
corruption. When allowed by law, 
any corporate political contributions 
outside of the United States require 
approval by the Area Vice President 
and assigned legal counsel.

Third-party brochure
To enhance our communications 
and expectations with third parties, 
3M has an online training course 
and has created a brochure for 
our business partners. The online 
training course covers anti-bribery 
and is available in 22 languages. The 
brochure, available in 27 languages, 
provides another way for 3M to 
communicate with our business 
partners regarding our commitment 
to combat global bribery. “At 3M, we pride 
ourselves with 
our long-standing 
commitment to doing 
the right thing. By 
Living our Code of 
Conduct, it allows 
us the opportunity 
to advance every 
company, enhance 
every home, and 
improve every life.”

How we workCode of Conduct
Our actions
Code of Conduct
We recently launched a refreshed 
version of our Code of Conduct , 
Be 3M, which is available in 
25 languages. We leveraged 
feedback from global stakeholders 
and employee focus groups to 
identify opportunities to make 
the Code more contemporary. 
We improved readability and 
added new sections: social media, 
Sustainability, speaking for the 
company, and volunteering and 
charitable giving. To create more 
interest, we added interactive 
learning aids, additional graphics, 
and imagery. We maintained our 
Code’s organization around the 
six “Be” mandates, which are 
universally understood (Be Good, 
Be Honest, Be Fair, Be Loyal, Be 
Accurate, and Be Respectful).Global Ethics and 
Compliance Day
All over the world, we held Ethics 
and Compliance Day events to 
further build employee engagement 
about the Code and doing the 
right thing. For the second year 
in a row, we held a compliance 
day in the U.S. Featured speakers 
included Mike Roman, Chief 
Executive Officer; Veena Lakkundi, 
Chief Compliance Officer and 
Vice President Compliance and 
Business Conduct; and Ivan Fong, 
Senior Vice President and General 
Counsel of 3M. In addition, we held 
a panel of business leaders who 
discussed ethical challenges, and 
we hosted a customer who spoke 
about the value of working with an 
ethical and compliant company. The 
theme of the U.S. compliance day 
was myth-busters. 3M scientists 
showcased experiments and 
explained scientific myths, while 
experts from various compliance 
functions in the company (including 
Corporate Audit, Global Security, 
Government Contract Compliance, 
Treasury, Finance, Investigation 
Teams, EHS, IT Quality and 
Compliance, Regulatory Trade, 
and U.S. Compliance Contacts) 
were stationed at booths where 
they held interactive discussions with employees about their area of 
expertise, answered their questions, 
and addressed some common 
myths about their areas. Games and 
videos were created to bring the 
Code to life in a fun, interactive way.
Living the  
Code award
This year, we promoted our Living 
the Code recognition program more 
broadly and widened the audience 
from which we accept nominations. 
Previously, nominations were 
raised through the Compliance 
and Business Conduct Department 
and our network of compliance 
contacts in our countries and 
businesses. Also, this year, we 
opened the nomination process 
to all employees and launched 
a communication campaign to 
energize employees about the 
program. To assure timely receipt 
and processing of nominations, we 
created a supporting infrastructure and new processes to guide the 
program and provide clarity on 
the type of conduct we recognize. 
This program is important to 3M, 
because it is the way we recognize 
employees who go above and 
beyond to do the right thing.  
Case studies  
and metrics
To provide greater transparency 
on the challenges our employees 
sometimes face, the Compliance 
and Business Conduct Department 
publishes and distributes case 
studies quarterly to all employees, 
highlighting real-life ethical 
dilemmas. The quarterly series 
of case studies not only includes 
missteps but also includes positive 
stories of individuals who made 
the right choice and received our 
Living the Code recognition.
Without revealing personal 
information, we include with each 
case study details on outcome and 
any disciplinary action the company 
took. Employees appreciate this 
level of transparency and find 
the relatable examples useful 
for their learning. Finally, the 
quarterly series of case studies 
includes metrics and infographics 
that highlight activity from our hotline and resulting disciplinary 
action taken for cases, which we 
substantiate and close each quarter.
Supervisor toolkit
Because most ethical challenges 
are raised to a person’s manager 
or supervisor, we created a series 
of tools and reference material 
for supervisors to help address 
employee questions and respond 
appropriately when dealing with 
potential violations of the law or 
the Code of Conduct. The tools 
include a simple guide and badge 
holder that describes the type of 
matters that should be immediately 
escalated to a subject-matter expert 
to handle and resolve. Additionally, 
we created a handbook to educate 
supervisors on the proper way to 
manage an employee concern. This 
handbook explains the investigation 
process, so supervisors have 
visibility into how 3M manages 
investigations. Finally, we created 
an animated video that illustrates 
examples of good and poor 
practices when dealing with 
employee concerns or questions.Senior leadership 
training
Leadership is critical to creating 
a culture of trust, ethics, and 
compliance. To help build upon 
our already strong leadership 
foundation, we launched training 
sessions for all Country Business 
Leaders and their Management 
Operating Committee members. 
Over 500 leaders went through 
individual one-on-one sessions 
with subject-matter experts 
in compliance or legal. The 
discussions were interactive and 
covered topics from all areas of 
ethics and compliance, including 
respectful workplace, third-party 
due diligence, and the investigation 
process, to name a few.108
#improvinglives
109 108We continue to focus on building 
and maintaining our culture of 
ethics, encouraging speak-up, 
and enhancing our controls.
Building on our foundation of 
executive messaging, we will 
turn our focus on messaging to 
middle management. Middle 
management influences day-to-day 
operations, and these individuals 
are typically the first people 
employees consult regarding 
ethical concerns. In 2019, we will 
launch quarterly communications to 
supervisors, providing information 
that will enable them to set the 
right tone and candidly discuss 
ethical issues with their team.
While supervisors play an important 
role in managing employee 
concerns, protecting 3M’s 
reputation is the responsibility 
of all employees. To reinforce 
this message, we will continue to 
hold ethics and compliance days 
around the world. We will also 
test new communication tools to 
increase employee engagement 
and awareness of compliance. We 
will develop and release a unique 
“Moment of Truth” video series that 
will feature 3M employees telling 
their stories of ethical dilemmas.We will enhance our existing Local 
Compliance Contact Network to 
expand our reach, reduce gaps, 
and improve our overall culture of 
compliance. We will standardize 
the role globally and provide 
clarity on the responsibilities of a 
contact. Further, we will identify 
the attributes of an ideal candidate 
for this position and the value 
the role brings to a contact’s 
career development at 3M.  
Finally, we will expand our data 
analysis by leveraging data from 
sources outside of Compliance 
and Business Conduct, including 
Finance, Customer Relationships, 
and other systems. We will analyze 
this data to be more predictive in 
the manner we assess risk, identify 
trends, and prioritize activity. We 
will also seek to simplify and 
automate compliance processes 
by integrating them into new 
systems and workflow tools at 3M.forwardLooking #improvinglives111
3M 2019 Sustainability Report
1101103M 2019 Sustainability Report
How we work
where 3M does business.” In 
the event of business operations 
changes, we follow all applicable 
local laws and regulations regarding 
notice periods for both union 
and nonunion employees.
Approximately 8 percent of 3M’s 
global workforce is unionized, 
with the number rising to 21 
percent when labor agreements 
are included. We are aware that 
in some countries, collective 
bargaining rights are not protected 
or recognized. Nevertheless, 3M 
assures that freedom of association 
and collective bargaining aspects 
of our Human Rights Policy apply 
to all 3M employees worldwide.
Child labor and 
minimum hiring age
3M is committed to doing our 
part to help abolish child labor.
This commitment is evident in our 
Human Rights Policy and Supplier  
Responsibility Code. Although 
the permissible hiring age for 
employees may vary based on the 
laws of different countries, 3M 
has adopted global expectations 
regarding the hiring of minors. 
Even if local law permits it, 3M will 
not hire any employee nor engage 
a contingent worker (individual 
provided by a third-party staffing manufacturing. 3M also complies 
with all applicable laws relating to 
overtime and breaks. Additional 
information can be found in 
our compensation section .
Freedom of 
association and the 
right to collective 
bargaining 
3M works diligently to create 
a work culture that affords all 
employees the opportunity to work 
without fear of intimidation, reprisal, 
or harassment, in an environment 
where employees are able to get 
their questions addressed in a fair 
and timely manner. In all locations, 
the company’s relationship with 
employees, whether union or 
nonunion, is a key responsibility 
of all leaders, assisted by human 
resources representatives. Human 
resources professionals work with 
employees to maintain positive 
employee relations.
Our Human Rights Policy has a 
specific subdivision on the freedom 
of association, which assures 
that we respect “the ability of 
employees to choose whether or 
not to join unions and engage in 
collective bargaining, as permitted 
by applicable laws in the countries A respectful 
workplace
As part of 3M’s Code of Conduct 
to Be Respectful , the Respectful 
Workplace Principle  states that 
“everyone is entitled to respectful 
treatment in the 3M workplace. 
Being respectful means being 
treated honestly and professionally, 
with each person’s unique talents, 
background, and perspectives 
valued. A respectful workplace is 
free from unlawful discrimination 
and harassment, but it involves 
more than compliance with the law. 
It is a work environment that is free 
of inappropriate or unprofessional 
behavior and consistent with 
3M’s ethics and values — a place 
where all employees can do 
their best, and are free to report 
workplace concerns without 
fear of retaliation or reprisal.”
Working hours and 
living wages
3M complies with minimum 
wage legislation globally, and we 
make every effort to exceed legal 
minimum wage. Our competitive 
compensation reflects our practice 
of establishing competitive salary 
ranges based on actual pay data 
from benchmark peer companies in Leadership Behaviors . We continue 
to implement our human rights 
program through our global policies, 
management system, assessments, 
audits, training, and ultimately, 
metrics tracking. Our audit process 
is truly global, and we are increasing 
the number of assessments we 
are performing, which gives 
us a global perspective on our 
own internal locations, including 
all manufacturing locations.
Human rights 
elements brought  
to life 
Our commitment to upholding 
human and workplace rights 
is embodied in the 3M Human 
Resource (HR) Principles, which 
respect the dignity and worth of all 
individuals, encourage the initiative 
of each employee, challenge 
individual capabilities, and provide 
equal opportunity for development.Our 
commitment 
Our Human Rights Policy  
applies to all 3M employees, 
contingent workers, anyone doing 
business with or on our behalf, 
candidates for hire at 3M, and 
others acting on 3M’s behalf. 
In 2014, we became a participant 
of the United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC), thereby 
committing to align our operations 
and strategies with the UNGC 
principles on business and human 
rights. We support its “protect, 
respect and remedy” framework 
and its principles of due diligence. 
Furthermore, our Code of Conduct 
requires compliance with all 
applicable laws and respect for 
internationally recognized human 
rights in all global operations.
We also recognize the International 
Labor Organization Declaration on

declaration commits member states 
to respect and promote principles

How we workHuman trafficking
Our approach to human 
trafficking, sometimes referred 
to as “modern slavery,” is very 
simple: We do not tolerate it.
Our Human Rights Policy details our 
prohibition on human trafficking. 
We are committed to using 
effective systems and controls to 
prevent human trafficking from 
taking place anywhere within 
our business or supply chains.
These prohibitions apply to 3M 
and its subsidiaries as well as 
to our federal contracts and 
subcontracts for either commercial 
or non-commercial items.
Expectations regarding labor 
and human resource practices 
also apply to all of our suppliers 
worldwide (see the supplier section  
of this report for more details). 3M 
suppliers must comply with all local 
country labor and human resource 
laws and cannot use labor that is 
obtained through mental or physical 
coercion, physical punishment, 
slavery, or other oppressive labor 
conditions, and cannot engage in 
any form of human trafficking.Medical surveillance
We monitor our employees 
periodically based on their 
potential exposure to chemical and 
physical hazards in the workplace. 
We screen for early signs of 
occupational illnesses to protect 
workers from further exposure 
and provide prompt care. We 
also look for trends in the health 
data in working populations to 
assure that potential hazards are 
well-controlled. While many of 
these programs are mandated 
by government requirements, 
others are established to meet 
3M’s more protective standards.
3M is one of the few companies 
supporting an internal occupational 
epidemiology program. For the 
past 24 years, this group has 
conducted epidemiologic studies 
to examine health outcomes among 
3M manufacturing workers and 
their potential association with 
occupational exposures and other 
workplace conditions. Occupational 
epidemiology research is used 
to inform risk assessments 
and the development of risk 
management activities within 3M.  free flu shots, health-conscious

3M Medical
3M Medical is committed to 
protecting and enhancing the 
health and productivity of our 
employees.  We promote a 
culture of health and well-being 
at 3M by understanding and 
addressing the potential stressors 
in the workplace and promoting 
disease prevention and health 
improvement. We also respond to 
health concerns of our workforce 
and communities and provide 
medical care for our employees.
Our programs are designed to 
prevent health-related problems.  
Clinical services for illness and 
injuries are offered at 3M facilities 
worldwide. 3M's Medical Record visitors in both emergency and 
non-emergency situations such as 
accidents, incidents, loss or theft,

Operations Center (GSOC) monitors 
risks and intelligence sources 
worldwide and supports local 
operations in severe situations. 3M 
Alert emergency messages inform 
workers of safety and security 
threats and situations and also 
provide a response mechanism 
to check on the safety of workers 
after a catastrophic or severe event. 
The GSOC also manages traveler 
safety, using 3M-provided tools 
and resources to help employees 
anticipate disruptions and easily 
change their travel plans if 
needed, and to provide emergency 
care and services if needed.

Healthy living
Health, wealth, wellness, and 
resilience create a framework for a 
collection of programs, resources, 
and services designed to help 
employees and their families 
achieve their well-being goals.  
While programs and services 
vary globally, examples include agency to perform temporary work) 
below the age of 15 for any job. If 
the applicable laws impose a higher 
minimum age requirement than 15, 
3M follows the stricter standard 
in compliance with the law. 
Forced and 
compulsory labor
3M complies with all applicable 
laws and employment regulations 
and does not engage or participate 
in forced labor. We have those 
same expectations for all 
vendors doing business with us. 
This commitment is evident in 
our Human Rights Policy and 
Supplier Responsibility Code.
Safe and healthy 
workplace
3M policies assure that the 
company provides a safe and 
healthy workplace to all employees, 
and that the 3M workplace 
complies with applicable laws, 
regulations, and policies.  
3M’s facilities are secured and 
monitored to protect 3M’s property, 
assets, people, and operations, 
and are accessible with badge 
access. Uniformed security workers

security, release of information, 
transfer of records, record

or participates in a company 
investigation. This position is 
reflected in the Non-Retaliation 
Policy and within 3M’s Employee 
Obligations and Reporting Principle .
In addition, we conduct audits 
of site, workplace, and human 
resource practices, and we conduct 
assessments and audits of suppliers 
to assure compliance with 3M’s 
expectations related to labor 
practices (see the supplier section 
of this report for more details).
Assuring human rights 
through training
We perform global training to 
assure that all 3M employees 
comply with the law, 3M’s Code 
of Conduct, supporting policies, acknowledge 3M’s Systems 
Access Control Standard and 
other 3M policies and standards.
Management requires employees, 
contingent workers, and suppliers 
to apply security in accordance 
with established policies and 
procedures. All 3M employees 
and, where relevant, contingent 
workers and suppliers, must receive 
appropriate awareness training and 
regular updates in organizational 
policies and procedures, as 
relevant for their job function.
Filing, addressing, 
and resolving 
workplace concerns
When concerns related to 
human rights, labor practices, 
environmental, or safety issues 
arise, our employees and non-
employees are encouraged and 
trained to raise questions or 
report misconduct or potential 
misconduct. We provide a variety 
of mechanisms for reporting 
and resolving concerns:

With the alarming rise in corporate 
security breaches worldwide, 
our Human Resource Security 
Standard presents the controls 
required to achieve human 
resource security based on industry 
standards and best practices.
Roles and responsibilities of 
information security employees, 
contingent workers, and suppliers 
must be defined and documented in 
accordance with the 3M Information 
Security Management System 
(ISMS). Background checks verify 
on all candidates for employment, 
contingent workers, and suppliers 
must be carried out in accordance 
with relevant laws, regulations, 
and ethics, and be proportional 
to the business requirements, the 
classification of the information to  
be accessed, and the perceived risks.
As part of their contractual obligation, 
employees must agree to and 
sign the terms and conditions of 
their employment contract, which 
states not only their own, but their 
organization’s responsibilities for 
information security. Contingent 
workers and suppliers in the 
U.S. are required to review and standards, and procedures. 
3M’s Compliance and Ethics

online compliance training 
program for all employees 
worldwide so 3M employees are 
aware of and understand their 
responsibilities and obligations.
Our online training program 
assigns training modules to each 
employee based on their role and 
area of responsibility. An annual 
training plan is established each 
year based on an assessment of 
internal and external factors for 
prioritizing topics and timing of

to human rights

The 3M Code of Conduct 
describes the  company’s business  
conduct principles , or core values, 
which set forth global corporate 
expectations for all 3M employees 
and third parties who act on 3M’s 
behalf. The principles in this Code 
remain consistent with 3M’s 
long-standing business conduct 
principles, its values, and our shared 
ethical standards for conducting 
business with uncompromising 
honesty and integrity.
In our view, human rights due 
diligence requires a holistic 
approach. We assess our own 
business, and others acting on 
our behalf — in supply roles, 
government relationships, 
acquisitions, mergers, and 
divestitures — to identify the  
salient human rights issues 
applicable to our business. We

are being upheld by these 
parties. Case in point: our 
approach to health and safety.
Under our Workplace  
Environmental, Health, and Safety  
Principle , 3M’s Code of Conduct 
requires 3M employees to select 
and retain suppliers, contractors, 
or outsourced manufacturers 
and service providers who 
comply with all applicable laws 
and regulations and meet 3M’s 
environmental, health, and 
safety values. In addition, at 3M 
locations, all visitors, vendors, 
and contract workers are held 
to the same safety and health 
requirements as 3M employees.
See the health and safety section 
for additional information on 
this assessment process.
Our suppliers
At 3M, we recognize the choices 
we make for our material and 
service providers must also reflect 
our values. We want our suppliers 
to share our commitment to 
maintaining compliant, responsible, 
and sustainable operations and 
practices. In addition to full Within our own 
business
Within 3M, our approach to 
managing and assuring human 
rights aligns with the 3M Code 
of Conduct, which recognizes 
the right of employees to have 
a respectful workplace.
To protect that right, our Employee 
Relations (ER) Assessment tool 
enables any 3M location globally 
to assess its policies and practices. 
Using the tool, and tracking data 
throughout the assessment process, 
leaders can review practices related 
to 3M’s Human Rights Policy, 
identify strengths and opportunities 
for improvement, and develop an 
action plan for closing any potential

compensation 
philosophy and 
elements
The Nominating and Governance  
Committee  periodically receives 
reports on the status of the 
Board’s compensation in relation 
to other large U.S. companies and 
is responsible for recommending  
to the Board changes in 
compensation for non-employee 
directors. In developing its 
recommendations, the committee 
is guided by the following goals:
•  Compensation should fairly pay 
directors for work required in a 
company of 3M’s size and scope
•  A significant portion of the total 
compensation should be paid in stock 
to align directors’ interests with the 
long-term interests of stockholders
•  The structure of the compensation 
should be simple and transparent
Periodically, at the request of 
the Nominating and Governance 
Committee, Frederic W. Cook 
& Co., Inc. conducts a survey of 
director compensation at other 
large U.S. companies and provides 
expert advisory support to the committee on the compensation 
of non-employee directors.
Here, we are all 
leaders
Compensation to 3M employees 
is not just tied to their job 
description, but how they act 
on it. This holds true for general 
leadership responsibilities, as 
well as performance related 
to Sustainability issues. 3M 
Leadership Behaviors, standards 
set forth in the 3M Playbook, 
establish expectations and ways 
everyone can demonstrate and 
meet those expectations through 
their actions and interactions.
Six behaviors of effective  
leaders at 3M:
Play to win
Foster collaboration 
and teamwork
Innovate
Prioritize and execute
Develop others 
and self
Act with integrity 
and transparency3M innovation takes a lot of 
people who are constantly 
searching for new and better ways 
to make innovation happen. People 
who challenge the status quo and 
welcome change. And people who 
know how to leverage internal and 
external networks to create win-
win solutions.
To make sure we are constantly 
innovating, our leaders must 
create an environment that 
allows and challenges people to 
seek out new ideas and process 
improvements that drive success. 
Our “Innovate” Leadership Behavior 
includes an expectation to support 
3M’s Sustainability goals.
Ratings of achievement against 
measurable targets impact 
employees’ award values for 
those who are eligible for variable 
compensation. For those employees 
eligible to receive long-term 
incentive compensation, ratings of 
Leadership Behaviors impact their 
long-term incentive grant values.
Earn up to your true 
potential
All employees have the opportunity 
to grow through challenging work 
and be rewarded for their efforts. Our  
commitment 
3M is committed to providing 
competitive market pay and 
comprehensive benefits. 
In addition to providing a 
professional work environment 
that promotes innovation and 
rewards performance, 3M’s total 
compensation for employees 
includes a variety of components 
that support sustainable 
employment and the ability to 
build a strong financial future.
We believe in pay  
for performance 
3M is a pay-for-performance 
company. In addition to earning 
base salary, executives are 
compensated for their contributions 
to the company’s growth, 
profitability, and other goals. 
This compensation falls into one of two categories: short-term 
cash incentives in the form of an 
annual performance-based award 
opportunity, as well as long-term 
equity incentives in the form of 
annual awards of performance 
shares and stock options, and in 
certain circumstances (for purposes 
of hiring or retaining key talent, 
for example), grants of restricted 
stock or restricted stock units.
As detailed in the 3M Board  
of Directors’ Compensation 
Committee Charter , all aspects 
of compensation are reviewed 
regularly by the Compensation  
Committee , which is composed 
solely of independent non-
employee directors. The committee, 
along with their independent 
compensation consultant, assesses 
the design and risks associated 
with executive compensation 
and recommends changes, when 
appropriate. Its recommendations 
related to compensation for 
3M’s Chief Executive Officer 
are subject to ratification by all of the independent members 
of the Board of Directors.
The Compensation Committee 
reviews stakeholder proposals 
relating to executive compensation 
matters and recommends 
to the Board the company’s 
response to such proposals.
3M executives are also eligible 
to participate in three deferred-
compensation plans that enable 
them to save for retirement or for 
other reasons and receive certain 
other benefits, such as financial 
planning services. Approximately 
100 executives were eligible for 
this program in 2018, including all 
of the named executive officers.

Our employee performance review 
process directly connects to an 
individual’s compensation. The 
intent of the process is to align 
individual goals and performance 
with business objectives and 
outcomes, creating a win-win 
situation for the employee and the 
company. In addition, the process 
helps identify and develop leaders 
to meet 3M’s ongoing talent needs.
Additional information on 3M’s 
employee development and 
compensation can be found 
in our employee programs  
section  and at 3M.com .
Our actions
3M has an industry-leading 
formula for compensation that 
helps provide equitable pay for all 
employees. We compare 3M salary 
data and compensation practice 
annually, and make both market 
and competitive adjustments 
as needed to assure our pay 
levels at each grade level are 
competitive. Ultimately, we factor 
in performance accelerators based 
on an annual performance review 
and the Leadership Behaviors 
discussed in Our Commitment .At 3M, the proportion of total 
rewards aligned with variable 
(incentive) pay increases with job 
level and is reflective of the job 
level’s influence on both short- and 
long-term results. Eligibility for 3M’s 
Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) and 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is 
based on job level, considering both 
the job level’s ability to influence the 
incentive period being measured 
and market competitiveness for 
these types of compensation.
Additional information on 3M 
Total Rewards can be found in 
our employee program section .
Pay based on role, 
responsibilities, skills, 
and performance
We maintain our focus on our 
global compensation principles to 
provide market-competitive, fair, 
and equitable pay. We continue our 
journey to assure we appropriately 
benchmark compensation within 
our many locations globally and use 
consistent methods of analyzing 
our compensation position against 
the market. Efforts continued in 
2018 to standardize and simplify 
our methodology around market 
pricing, utilizing data sources 
from multiple vendors. As we move forward, we will continue 
to look for ways to handle 
this process in an increasingly 
efficient and consistent manner.
Our Global Market Pricing Process 
assures market-competitive 
compensation for employees and 
drives consistency and transparency 
in compensation practices across 
all regions. Using common job 
descriptions and grades throughout 
the world, this project used data 
from three global surveys to 
benchmark pay levels and map job 
grades, which helps drive our pay 
principles for fair and equitable pay.Delivering on the 
promise of fair and 
equitable pay
3M has the same annual incentive 
plan design for everyone, from 
our executive officers all the way 
through the entire organization — 
the same payout curves, thresholds, 
maximums, metrics, and metric 
weightings. By direction from 
the Compensation Committee 
of the Board of Directors and 
our continuous improvement 
efforts, we redesigned the AIP to 
bring the payout curves closer to 
those of our peers. Peers include 
companies we compete with for 
investors, executive talent, and 
general employee talent. Moving 
forward, with the new payout 
curves, our plan is designed to 
be more competitive, pay out 
higher when we exceed targets, 
and hit the maximum sooner than 
in the past. But it’s a give-and-
take situation: In order to provide 
the chance for a better upside 
payout, we must accept the 
additional risk of a smaller or no 
payout if we don’t meet targets.
In 2019, the Compensation 
Committee formally added a review 
of matters relating to internal pay 
equity to their list of responsibilities.#improvinglives3M 2019 Sustainability Report

over 25 hours per year of training 
and development per full-time 
equivalent (FTE) employee, those 
hours are only one part of the 
picture. We leverage a 70-20-10 
development model which indicates 
that, over the course of a career, 
70 percent of learning is done on 
the job, 20 percent comes through 
other employees, and only  
10 percent of meaningful development is reached 
through formal training.
Our learning orientation and 
philosophy focuses on experiential 
learning and skill building rather 
than classroom-style training. While 
we can estimate that our training 
numbers are close to averages 
found in other large manufacturing 
companies, measures such 
as training hours or costs per 
employee are not leading human 
capital performance indicators 
for 3M. We believe indicators 
that align people’s results to 
the success of the company are 
direct performance indicators of 
development programs. Leadership 
and employee engagement, 
employee retention rates, 
brand recognition, acquisition 
integration milestones, and Lean 
Six Sigma (LSS) project value are 
a few examples of indicators that 
contribute to 3M's recognition as an 
industry and global business leader.
3M has prioritized learning and 
career development opportunities 
not only for leaders, but for 
all employees. Further, 3M 
has separate processes for 
employee performance and 
career development. This permits 
employees the freedom to 
create meaningful development plans without performance or 
compensation implications. 
Employee 
development for all
Effective employee development 
programs are crucial to enable our 
goal of 100 percent of employees 
engaging in development activities. 
With the global launch of our 
new employee learning platform, 
Develop U, employees are easily 
able to access development 
resources to support their career 
aspirations and advance strategic 
capabilities within 3M. Develop 
U provides employees with a 
personalized experience by 
recommending relevant content 
based on their role within the 
organization. Additionally, content 
is organized and aligned to directly 
support our organizational priorities, 
including the 3M Leadership 
Behaviors, company-defined 
functional competencies, LSS, 
Sustainability, and supervisory 
content. Develop U provides access 
to tens of thousands of unique, just-
in-time learning resources in over 
15 languages, allowing 3M’s global 
workforce to engage in employee 
development. Given this breadth, 
we’ve seen more than 50 percent 
of our global workforce engage Our 
commitment 
At 3M, our culture is critical to 
enabling the magic we know as 
science. It’s extremely important 
that all our employees are able 
to focus on making an impact on 
the world and feel empowered to 
bring innovation into their work.
Engaged employees, we believe, 
are more satisfied with their work, 
tend to stay longer, and are more 
productive and committed. We 
foster and reinforce behaviors 
that support engagement on many 
levels, including networking, 
collaboration, diversity, and 
inclusion. We focus on the quality 
and the impact of professional 
development and career growth. 
If you want to develop as an 
individual, there are many 
things that make 3M the 
place to be. Our science not 
only impacts our customers around the world, it makes a 
difference in the way we work.
Our company touches nearly 
every industry in every market 
globally. If you work at 3M, you 
have a range of development 
opportunities few other companies 
can offer. Our people can live in 
different countries, learn different 
cultures, and develop different 
skills across different industries.
It’s possible for someone to go 
from a lab, to marketing, to sales, 
to business development, and 
all the way up to the C-suite. 
3M is so diverse that people can 
reinvent themselves and their 
career all within one company 
— and so inclusive that they’ll 
be able to collaborate with 
other curious, creative minds 
wherever they go. For more 
information, see the employee  
diversity and inclusion section . 2025 Goal: 100 
percent participation 
in employee 
development 
programs to 
advance individual 
and organizational 
capabilities.
Our employees are encouraged 
and supported to pursue 
areas of interest and develop 
career paths and opportunities 
aligned with those interests.
Our actions
Our most valuable resource is 
our people, and we invest in their 
success. We offer a wide range of 
benefits and discounts designed to 
help our people live their best. We 
also provide tools, opportunities, 
and support for people who 
want to grow their careers.Employee

How we workEmployee programs
in formal training on Develop U. 
Further, 2018 saw the broad-scale 
launch of virtual, instructor-led 
trainings and webinars, facilitated 
through Develop U. These and other 
live events pushed our live event 
completions total to over 102,000 
and reached both production and 
non-production employees globally. 
Employees create or update 
development plans that include 
activities to elevate individual 
skills and further career 
development. Employees can 
use additional skill-mapping 
tools in collaboration with their 
supervisors to identify long-term 
desired goals and define actions 
needed to help reach those goals. 
A key part of career development 
is understanding career paths and 
resources. 3M makes available to 
employee’s functional competency 
models that clarify expectations 
regarding the knowledge, skills, 
and abilities to be developed 
over a career within a specific 
function. Based on shared 
expectations, career paths are 
aligned with investment in training 
and development resources. Each 
function follows its competency 
model to leverage 3M’s learning 
platform and direct employees to 
relevant training opportunities. Functions also provide development 
suggestions that can grow the 
competency through on-the-
job activities or social learning 
through a coach or mentor. 
Currently, the competency-based 
resources cover approximately 
93 percent of the non-production 
professional employee population.
At 3M, wisdom is shared. Just 
as we share and combine our 
technologies, we also share and 
combine our knowledge through 
mentorship and storytelling. We 
define mentoring as a unique 
relationship in which a mentor (a 
more experienced person) helps 
a mentee (a less experienced 
person) with their development in a 
particular area. Further information 
can be found at Mentorships at 3M .
Doing things right, 
right from the start
3M invests in onboarding and 
developing new employees so that 
they have the tools, resources, and 
networks they need to succeed. 
Our onboarding process begins 
at the time a candidate accepts a 
job offer and continues through 
the first year of employment.A consistent, comprehensive 
onboarding platform provides 
pre-start information delivery and 
engagement for new employees 
on the front end, and clear 
metrics, reporting, and tracking 
for 3M on the back end. This 
investment sets up new employees 
to succeed and make meaningful 
contributions from the start.
Nurturing 
the leader in 
everyone
Leadership development is a 
competitive advantage at 3M. 
To maintain this advantage, we 
are leveraging new technologies 
and delivery methods, thereby 
assuring impact, consistency, 
and global inclusivity. 
Through various stages in a 
leader’s career journey, there are 
many development opportunities 
and programs available, across 
every geographic region and 3M 
business. Programs include a range 
of online and self-paced offerings, 
from personal effectiveness to 
financial acumen, that cover 
core skill development aligned 
to the 3M Leadership Behaviors. 
These programs also focus on the future by embedding inclusive 
leadership strategies, promoting 
development through corporate 
social responsibility, and offering 
mentoring opportunities.
Global executive 
and leadership 
development
The 3M Leadership Way is a 
suite of high-potential leadership 
development journeys within 
the 3M Global Academy of 
Innovative Development, bringing 
one consistent approach to how 
3M develops leaders across all 
geographic areas, business groups, 
and functions. Each program is an 
integration of customer-focused, 
results-driven, and experience-
based learning that takes leaders 
outside the classroom walls to 
sharpen their skills with leadership 
challenges for our customers and in 
our global communities. 
Catalyst 
Catalyst is a 12-month journey 
focused on developing the 
company’s top 250 leaders. These 
individuals are game changers with 
aspiration, potential, performance, 
and with a pace even beyond 
their high-potential peers to make a step-change impact for 
3M and the world we live in. 
Amplify
Amplify is a nine-month journey 
for leaders with potential to 
reach the director level. Similar 
to the Catalyst journey, Amplify 
is scaled to the leadership 
challenges faced by future 
directors. These individuals already 
lead teams and organizations 
across every part of 3M.
Ignite
Ignite is a six-month journey for 
leaders with potential to reach 
senior manager level. These 
individuals are transitioning to 
lead teams, and development is 
focused on critical challenges 
such as vertical and horizontal 
management savvy and building 
and leading high-performing teams. 
Spark
Launched in 2017, Spark is a 
yearlong development journey 
for individual contributors and 
frontline leaders with potential 
to reach manager level. For the 
first time, 3M has leveraged the 
power of technology to offer leadership development and 
bring together (virtually) more 
than 3,700 leaders from around 
the world under one journey.
Development for 
people leaders
With focus on the critical skills that 
leaders need to be successful in 
leading others, the Essentials for 
People Leaders program emerged 
as a multi-module program with 
flexibility to be delivered as face-
to-face classroom training or as 
online, virtual training. This flexible 
delivery format is key to providing a 
consistent development experience 
for all leaders of 3M while still 
allowing for needed localization.
All-leader 
development
All our people globally, at every 
level of the organization at 3M, 
are provided with opportunities 
to develop themselves as leaders. 
These leadership development 
offerings target areas of 
strategic importance, including 
the development of a growth 
mindset, agility, innovation, and 
customer focus. Delivery of 
content is available face-to-face in 
experiential workshops, through #improvinglives1293M 2019 Sustainability Report3M 2019 Sustainability Report

How we workEmployee programs

and via self-paced e-modules.
Coaching
3M has invested in an internal team 
of certified leadership coaches 
to support and accelerate the 
development of leaders around 
the world. These coaches work in 
a variety of ways with 3M leaders. 
We offer one-on-one time with a 
coach to help employees apply new 
learning or work through a change 
with on-demand coaching. We 
also work with teams to help them 
stay close to changing stakeholder 
expectations and lead 3M into the 
future. More than 725 leaders have 
already worked with a leadership 
coach at 3M. More than 3,000 
leaders have been through a 
coaching skill-building workshop. 
Be rewarded  
for your efforts
To drive 3M’s successes, we 
provide incentives to our employees 
to excel. Our process includes two 
components: measurable targets 
agreed upon by employees and 
their supervisor, and Leadership 
Behaviors ratings, which reflect 
the extent to which the employee 
engaged in core behaviors that allow 3M to execute our strategies 
and meet our objectives.
The performance assessment 
process helps hold each of our 
employees accountable for his 
or her contribution and everyday 
behaviors. The process aligns 
personal goals with organizational 
goals — we strive to achieve 
our goals in ways that support 
and strengthen our culture and 
achieve sustainable growth. In 
addition, 3M has long prioritized 
taking a well-rounded view of an 
individual’s performance, assuring 
that employees are treated in a 
fair and consistent manner:
•  Performance goals, linked to 
higher-level organizational goals, 
are set jointly between the 
individual and his or her leader
•  Tools provided to leaders facilitate 
conversations between leaders 
and employees to assure mutual 
understanding of expectations 
and desired behaviors
•  Feedback on progress toward 
these goals is provided formally, 
twice a year, and supervisors 
are taught and encouraged to 
provide routine feedback to help 
employees adjust performance 
and meet or exceed goals•  Management Team Reviews function 
not only to provide comprehensive 
information about an employee, but 
also to further the goal that rating 
considerations will be consistent for 
employees within an organization
Each year, all 3M non-production 
employees identify their 
contributions in meeting their 
specified goals through an 
employee performance process. 3M 
strives to have 100 percent of non-
production employees complete the 
entire performance review process. 
In 2018, all eligible employees 
were rated through the calibration 
meetings, and these employees and 
their supervisors received tasks 
to complete the year-end process 
in the performance system.
Learning from 
listening 
For more than 50 years, 3M has 
been conducting surveys to solicit 
employee observations, attitudes, 
and opinions. Our Standard 
Opinion Survey program covers 
the entire globe and provides 
specific and relevant feedback to 
major units within the company 
(divisions, locations, and countries, 
for example). All employees have 
the opportunity to complete the 
3M Standard Opinion Survey, and our average response rates 
are typically about 85 percent. 
The Standard Opinion Survey 
program enables us to regularly 
assess the state of employee 
engagement and other workplace 
factors critical to high performance 
and being a great place to work. 
We provide in-depth reports 
for the leaders of the business 
groups surveyed and assure their 
leaders and top 3M leadership 
are aware of these survey results. 
This is a cycle of continuous 
improvement for us, year after year.   
Each unit or business group that 
surveys must review their results, 
present them to their employees, 
and execute an action plan to 
address the issues that arise from 
the results. We built supports into 
our process that make it easier 
to bring about successful change 
through action planning — such as 
accountability checks and specific 
tools to act on the results. We 
identified key drivers of employee 
engagement and developed and 
deployed learning opportunities 
for leaders (multiple on-demand 
instructional videos on engagement, 
for example). We continually 
assess survey content and update 
as needed to assure alignment 
with company strategy and major initiatives. Thus, our surveys support 
strategy and business objectives 
directed at supporting sustainable 
corporate success through our 
employees’ behavior on the job.  
Long may your 
curiosity flourish here 
Our global voluntary turnover 
rate continues to be under 6 
percent, a source of great pride 
for our company. We calculate 
voluntary turnover separately 
from retirements, company-
initiated turnover, and reductions 
in force. Voluntary employee 
turnover is defined as turnover 
due to employee-initiated 
reasons (for example, returning 
to school or going to another 
job in a different company).
Total turnover includes voluntary 
turnover and all other forms of 
turnover (for example, termination 
as a result of restructuring, 
termination for poor performance, 
and retirements). Our total 
employee turnover rate is an 
annualized rate that measures 
employees who have terminated 
or retired from 3M during 
the calendar year, excluding 
foreign service employees and 
3M temporary employees.Temporary employees are 3M 
employees hired temporarily 
with intent to be employed 
short-term. They do not 
include contingent workers.
3M follows all applicable local 
laws and regulations regarding 
notice periods in the event of 
business operations changes. 
3M’s Human Resources Department 
is unique in that we have one global 
system to track HR information. 
At every 3M location around the 
globe, we have instant access 
to this information — using 
our global reporting tool.
Workforce 
experience, services, 
and rewards 
The more 3M employees contribute 
to 3M’s success, the more success 
they create for themselves. We 
offer a competitive base pay, and 
depending on position, variable 
incentive pay linked to company 
and individual performance. We 
also offer a wide range of benefits 
and discounts designed to help 
3M employees live their best. 030,000

How we workEmployee programs
Be rewarded  
for your efforts
Medical, dental, and vision plan 
options; savings and retirement 
plans; a 3M employee stock 
purchase plan; and many other 
resources can enhance a 3M 
employee’s life, both physically 
and financially. All regular full-time 
employees in the U.S. are eligible 
for these benefits — regular part-
time employees who work at least 
20 hours a week are also eligible. 
Some programs and benefits 
may differ internationally due 
to local laws and regulations. 
As of January 1, 2019, benefit 
eligibility also extends to domestic 
partners and their children. 
Our parental leave policy helps 
employees be their best selves at 
home and at work. All U.S. salaried 
mothers and fathers of newborn or 
newly adopted children are entitled 
to up to 20 weeks (10 weeks paid 
and 10 weeks unpaid) of parental 
leave. This policy was instituted 
in late 2016. In 2018, 1,159 U.S. 
eligible employees participated, 
including 354 females and — we’re 
proud to say — 805 males. 
In 2018, our overall U.S. work and 
retention rate, those returning after leave, was 81 percent for 
females and 91 percent for males.

that maximizes professional 
and personal productivity. FlexAbility puts into practice a 
new way of thinking: that your 
work life and your personal life 
can coexist. A FlexAbility plan 
can put the power in your hands 
to make choices that benefit you, 
your work, your team, your friends 
and family, and 3M.  For more

How we work 135#improvinglives
In 2019, we will continue to work 
toward our 2025 Sustainability 
Goal for employee participation in 
development by strengthening our 
“development for all” philosophy. 
One example: We’ll be launching 
a Data Analytics / Big Data 
University-type program, given 
this skill set has been identified as 
a development need across 3M. 
We will also be continuing our 
work to meet employees where 
they are by offering more choice in 
how content is made available. For 
example, we’ll have both single-
hour virtual sessions and multi-hour 
in-person workshops on the same 
topics — allowing employees with 
the time and interest to invest in an 
in-person session, and those with 
less time or a remote location to 
attend a condensed virtual program.
As we build 3M for the future, 
strengthening our culture is a 
top priority. At its core, culture 
is how we do things at 3M, and 
it belongs to all of us equally. As 
part of obtaining information or 
input on a topic, we are engaging 
our employees by broadening 
our listening strategies. In 2019, 
actions will be taking place 
on how 3M’s culture operates 
today and how it can and 
should operate in the future.Employee programs

How we work Health and saftey
Our 
commitment 
As a company that makes a vast 
array of products designed to 
protect workers, 3M is front and 
center in the global effort to bring 
new science and innovation to 
workplace safety. At the same 
time, as an enterprise with 
91,500 employees working 
around the world, we are always 
taking steps to further advance 
the safety of our employees.
3M is committed to helping 
improve the safety and health of 
people worldwide, so we can all 
focus on what matters most to us.
We also embrace this commitment 
for our own operations, and, to 
that end, will continue to take 
steps to further advance the 
safety of our most important 
asset: 3M employees.Process hazard 
management 
3M is committed to rigorously 
managing the risks associated 
with hazardous processes, such 
as those with potential to result 
in catastrophic fires, explosions, 
and sudden release of toxic 
materials. We use a Hazardous 
Process Evaluation Tool (HazPET) 
to categorize hazardous processes. 
Process hazard analyses (PHAs) are 
used to assess the effectiveness 
of existing safeguards. Layers 
of Protection Analysis (LOPA) is 
also used in some instances to 
evaluate safety-critical devices and 
systems, providing more attention 
to independent protection layers. 
Facility sitting assessments help 
us identify and mitigate "maximum 
credible event" scenarios that 
could impact workers at some 
facilities, and a global initiative 
that builds on 3M's existing 
guidance to our facilities around 
effectively managing potential 
combustible dust hazards.Employee safety  
and health 
The 3M Safety and Health 
Policy  applies to 3M operations 
everywhere, including new 
acquisitions. Hazards in 3M’s 
workplaces must be well 
understood and effectively 
managed to protect 3M 
employees, visitors, locations, 
and surrounding communities.
In addition, in the spirit of 
continuous improvement, 
much is being done to evaluate 
opportunities to raise our safety 
standards. We visit locations to 
identify and manage environmental, 
health, and safety (EHS) risks; 
evaluate compliance to regulatory 
requirements and conformance to 
3M policies and standards; identify 
opportunities for continuous 
improvement; and share exemplary 
practices among 3M auditable 
entities. Additional details on 
these efforts can be found in the 
environmental management section .To assure consistent reporting 
and metrics globally, 3M, like 
many multinational companies, 
follows the U.S. Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) recordkeeping rules and 
formulas to record and measure 
injury and illness rates worldwide. 
At all facilities within 3M’s 
operational control, 3M employees 
and contingent employees 
are covered by our injury and 
illness recordkeeping rules.
Contractor and visitor 
safety and health
3M requires all visitors, vendors, 
contingent workers, and contract 
workers at 3M locations to follow all 
applicable 3M workplace safety and 
health requirements. For example, 
contractors must complete a 
pre-qualification process before 
they may perform work on 3M 
premises. That process includes, 
among other things, reviewing the 
contractor’s employee injury/illness 
rates, Experience Modification Rates (EMR), employee training 
records, and safety committee 
activities. Contractor performance 
evaluations include safety 
reviews. Pre-construction 
safety reviews are conducted to 
address potential hazards and 
controls related to the work. 
Each 3M location has a contract 
coordinator who is the main 
3M contact for working with 
contractors on safety issues. The 
contract coordinator is empowered 
to participate in pre-bid meetings 
and pre-qualifications for 
contractors. He or she is on-site and 
therefore available for contractor 
meetings and safety reviews as 
necessary and appropriate.
Contractors are asked to submit 
notification to 3M of worker hours 
and any injuries occurring while 
performing work in accordance 
with a 3M contract. Any contractor 
incidents are reported in the 3M 
Worldwide Incident Management 
System (WIMS), including injuries 
and contractor worker hours. 
In 2018, a contractor fatality 
occurred as a result of injuries 
sustained from a fall while 
working at height. Additional 
preventive measures were 
implemented to further strengthen 
the safety of the operation.Health

Environmental, health, 
and safety (EHS) 
harmonization project
In 2018, 3M began laying the 
foundation for global harmonization 
of the company’s EHS process, 
the EHS harmonization project. 
The goal of this continuous 
improvement project is to build 
consistency worldwide; standards, 
self-assessments, and software 
systems are being reviewed. For 
instance, software systems will be 
configured for consistency across 
all EHS functional areas, including 
the 3M Global Safety and Health 
Plan Tool (GSHP). Ultimately, the 
impact of this ambitious project 
should make all 3M EHS efforts 
more effective and efficient. 
Global safety and 
health plan tool
GSHP, which is part of 3M's EHS 
management system, is required 
to be implemented by global 3M 
locations. This approach utilizes a 
well-developed self-assessment 
process that is categorized into

variety of tools to manage risks 
from hazards in the workplace. 
We’ve used specialized tools 
successfully for a number of years 
in the areas of process safety, 
industrial hygiene, and ergonomics. 
Each of these disciplines uses a 
risk management approach to 
categorize hazard levels and define 
appropriate levels of control.
As part of our continuous 
improvement efforts, in 2018, GSHP 
elements were incorporated in the 
new EHS harmonization project. 
Culture of  
excellence pilot
In the first quarter of 2018, an 
initiative was launched at 24 
3M facilities globally to drive a 
stronger culture of excellence 
in EHS. The project touches on 
the following key areas of EHS 
organizational performance:
•  Leadership and  
employee engagement 
•  Standardized work 
practice observations  
•  Recognition of exemplary 
work practices•  Identification and investigation 
of potential hazards
Development and enhancement 
of tools to readily capture the 
key areas above has begun. A 
companywide rollout of the 
program will begin in 2019.
Significant injury/
illness and fatality 
(SIF) rates
At the end of 2018, over 93,000 
risk assessments had been 
completed, which resulted in the 
identification and reduction of Ergonomics risk 
management 
3M’s Ergonomics Risk Reduction 
Process (ERRP) is a global, 
comprehensive program that 
integrates ergonomic job analysis 
and engineering design criteria 
to reduce exposure to commonly 
identified musculoskeletal disorder 
(MSD) risk factors. To accomplish 
this, we apply ergonomics risk 
assessment tools globally to 
identify and assess ergonomics 
risk in the industrial environment. 
Online ergonomic training is also 
available 24/7 to any employee 
who wants to learn more and has 
access to the 3M intranet. All 
of these efforts have paid off in 
reduced numbers of ergonomic 
recordable injury cases; see 
recordable incident rate chart.
Industrial exposure 
risk management
To accurately assess exposure 
management programs 
and activities, 3M uses the 
comprehensive approach outlined 
by the American Industrial 
Hygiene Association (AIHA). 
In the past decade, over 95 
percent of all chemical agents and noise baseline exposure risk 
assessments have been completed 
for all jobs. As prescribed by our 
Global Safety and Health Plan, we 
have also conducted proactive 
assessments of dermal exposure, 
engineered nanoparticles, hazard 
communication, personal protective 
equipment, respirator protection, 
and ventilation. These assessments 
help us determine whether any 
changes in exposure management 
programs are warranted.
Radiation protection
3M’s Corporate Radiation 
Protection and Compliance group 
(CRPC) provides hazard evaluations 
and develops and provides 
training for both radiation source 
users as well as facility radiation 
safety officers to help protect 3M 
employees, our customers, and 
the public. This includes uses of 
radiation in both manufacturing 
and R&D; ionizing radiation sources 
such as radioactive materials 
and x-ray emitting devices; and 
non-ionizing radiation sources 
such as lasers, microwave and 
radiofrequency radiation, magnetic 
fields, and ultraviolet, infrared, and 
visible light. Annual program audits 
evaluate facility performance in 
managing hazards during routine 
use and maintenance of radiation sources, security of radiation 
sources, training of personnel, 
and regulatory compliance.
Global EHS team
3M’s global EHS team continues 
to evolve to its current operational 
state, which we believe sets us 
apart from our peers. Comprised 
of business-level EHS committee 
members, regional EHS managers, 
and corporate subject-matter 
experts, this committee will work 
with EHS facility staff globally 
to address and replicate best 
practices, solve problems, and 
drive worthy EHS initiatives 
to the operational level.

How we work
Environmental 
management
Stewardship for the  
greater good.Environmental management
Our  
commitment
3M formalized its commitment 
to environmental stewardship 
when the company’s Board 
of Directors adopted the 3M  
Environmental Policy , in 1975. 
This policy established the 
framework for our approach 
to responsible environmental 
management and conservation of 
resources, emphasizing prevention 
of pollution at the source.
Since then, we have created 
supporting policies using a needs-
driven process. When we identify 
potential risks to the environment, 
health, and safety of our employees, 
products, and communities, we 
take steps to modify processes and 
standards to address these risks.
3M’s strategies for sustainable 
development encompass the 
pursuit of customer satisfaction 
and commercial success within a framework of environmental, 
social, and economic values. We 
are committed to complying 
with all applicable environmental 
requirements worldwide. Beyond 
compliance, the company continues 
to make significant investments 
to reduce the environmental 
footprint of our operations and 
our products with sustainable 
attributes to help customers 
reduce their environmental 
footprint and help meet their 
Sustainability goals. Always, 3M 
believes environmental policy and 
regulations should be guided by 
science-based decision making.
Our actions
Setting and implementing 
global environmental policies, 
management systems, and key 
performance metrics enables 
3M to continually integrate and 
drive environmental stewardship 
in our business groups globally, 
assuring consistency and innovative environmental thinking. As 
reflected by our environmental 
performance indicators and  2025  
Sustainability Goals , environmental 
stewardship is a core corporate 
commitment backed by decades 
of proven performance.
Management 
3M’s Environmental Management 
System (EMS) framework provides 
structure and consistency for 
overseeing daily activities, and puts 
the company in proactive, rather 
than reactive, mode regarding 
its environmental focus. We 
have extensive global systems 
in place to identify, track, and 
manage relevant information on 
corporate-wide environmental 
management and performance. 
This includes covering a full range 
of environmental compliance and 
operational performance metrics 
relevant to 3M operations, some of 
which are provided in this report.Quarterly scorecards report data at 
the facility, division, business group, 
and corporate levels. Scorecards 
are reviewed by executive 
management for performance on 
selected indicators, enabling 3M 
to monitor and identify successes, 
risks, and opportunities for 
performance improvements and 
footprint reductions worldwide. 
Environmental, health, 
and safety incident 
management
Since 2010, all 3M locations 
globally are required to internally 
report environmental exceedances, 
spills, agency notices, and fines 
through one dedicated system — 
3M’s Worldwide Incident 
Management System (WIMS). 
WIMS has led to continuous 
improvement related to increased 
awareness of responsibilities, 
understanding of the holistic 
system, and more consistent 
reporting requirements for 3M’s 
global operations.Environmental 
investments 
In 2018, 3M expended about  
$27 million for capital projects 
related to protecting the 
environment. This amount excludes 
expenditures for remediation 
actions relating to existing matters 
caused by past operations that 
do not contribute to current 
or future revenues, which are 
expensed. Capital expenditures 
for environmental purposes 
have included pollution control 
devices — such as wastewater 
treatment plant improvements, 
scrubbers, containment structures, 
solvent recovery units and thermal 
oxidizers — at new and existing 
facilities constructed or upgraded 
in the normal course of business. 
Consistent with the company’s 
emphasis on environmental 
responsibility, capital expenditures 
(other than for remediation 
projects) for known projects are 
presently expected to be about  
$75 million over the next two 
years for new or expanded 
programs to build facilities 
or modify manufacturing 
processes to minimize waste 
and reduce emissions.Environmental 
management 
implementation
Implementation of our 
EMS continues to increase 
throughout the world. 
Our approach calls for each site to 
establish, implement, and maintain 
documented environmental 
objectives and targets. When 
establishing an EMS plan, each 3M 
location must address financial, 
technological, operational, and 
business considerations. The 
objectives and targets should be 
measurable and consistent with our 
environmental policy, including our 
commitments to prevent pollution 
and comply with applicable 
regulations and other requirements.
3M’s multifaceted strategy for 
implementing EMS and global 
auditing of environmental 
compliance for our operations is 
key to understanding any potential 
gaps and gaining resolution quickly. 
All manufacturing locations, and 
new acquisitions based on their 
integration progress, are required 
to complete a Global Environmental 
Management Self-Assessment 
(GEMSA) at least annually. GEMSA #improvinglives1453M 2019 Sustainability Report3M 2019 Sustainability Report

How we work - Findings, with assignments of 
responsibility, due dates for closure, and 
tracking to completion
 - Detailed reviews of findings to assure 
corrective actions are complete
3M’s EHS auditing program is 
audited periodically by 3M’s 
Corporate Auditing Department. 
All EHS auditors, except for 
3M EHS professionals who are 
guest auditors, are required to 
take a certification test. 3M EHS 
professionals are assigned to 
an audit team or lead auditor to 
provide support on the auditing 
process and/or a specific 
subject during the audit.Environmental management
elements reflect procedures, 
systems, and processes that are 
comprehensive and mandatory to 
maintain compliance with legal or 
other requirements. Additional ISO 
14001 elements and associated 
questions are provided to enable 
sites to conduct further review 
of their EMS. Data from the 
assessments are validated through 
audits, site visits by subject-matter 
experts, and other data systems.
Beginning in 2019, GEMSA will 
become part of the 3M EHS 
harmonization project, which 
has been designed to bring more 
consistency to environmental, 
health, and safety assessments at 
3M facilities worldwide. Additional 
information on the 3M EHS 
harmonization project can be found 
in the health and safety section .
Environmental site 
assessment 
Outside 3M’s EMS and GEMSA, 3M 
has completed environmental site 
assessments at most locations, with 
the goal of identifying potential 
historical liabilities. Because of 
these assessments, we can identify 
these biodiverse areas. Where 
applicable, 3M conducts searches 
of public databases, which includes a wetland database. Site visits 
also identify areas such as rivers, 
creeks, and potential wetlands 
that are on or near the location.
We conduct additional biodiversity 
assessments during our annual 
evaluation, utilizing the definitions 
and tools established by the World 
Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD) to screen 
the company’s various uses of water. 
Additional details on this process 
can be found in the water section .
Applying ISO 14001
The ISO 14001 Environment 
Management System (EMS) 
standard is an internationally 
recognized approach for managing 
the immediate and long-term 
environmental impacts of an 
organization’s products, services, 
and processes. In 2018, 3M 
continued working with an outside 
consultant to help individual 
locations learn how to transition 
and recertify to the latest version 
of this standard, which was 
established in late 2015. 3M 
completed timely recertification of 
all relevant sites to the updated ISO 
14001 standard by year end 2018.
To help facilities comply with 
the new standard, 3M provides training modules in our Global 
Learning System. The modules 
are used by learning coordinators 
to create courses, manage learner 
roles, process certifications, and 
run reports; by learners to search 
for courses and launch e-learning 
classes; and by supervisors to view 
the learning activities of their direct 
reports and to pre-book courses.
All together, our ISO 
14001-certified locations account 
for approximately  92.3 percent 
of 3M’s total product output. 
Third-party assurance 
of Sustainability 
metric reporting
Bureau Veritas (BV) provided 
independent third-party verification 
of 3M’s 2018 environmental 
data (volatile organic compound 
emissions, water, waste, 
environmental compliance 
metrics, energy consumption, and 
greenhouse gas emissions) included 
in this 2019 Sustainability Report. 
For additional information on our 
third-party assurance, see Bureau  
Veritas’ Assurance Statement .Facility self-

3M verifies regulatory compliance 
and alignment with prioritized 
sections of the self-assessment, 
conducting environmental-related 
audits on a risk-prioritized basis. 
In all, our EHS facility audits 
covered sites that manufactured 
32.6 percent of sales value 
of production (SVOP). Comprised in the  
auditing process:
•  The frequency of environmental 
compliance audits on manufacturing, 
distribution, and laboratory 
operations is based on relative risk
•  At least annually, all global operations 
are assessed against a variety of 
criteria to establish a prioritized list 
of locations for compliance auditing
•  3M uses a variety of tools 
and resources for compliance 
auditing, including:
 - Internally developed compliance 
protocols created by subject-matter 
experts in regulatory programs and 3M 
processes
 -3M’s GEMSA as an evaluation tool
 - Externally purchased compliance 
protocols, especially for operations 
outside the United States, to assure local

Commitment to  
PFAS stewardship
PFAS are a family of chemical 
compounds made up of two 
essential elements – carbon 
and fluorine. The carbon-
fluorine bonds are exceptionally 
strong and stable even at high 
temperatures. They represent a 
broad class of compounds with 
many applications of industrial 
and social significance, including 
health care, advanced electronics, 
and replacement of materials with 
high global warming potential.
3M is constantly and proactively 
examining the environmental impact 
of our products. And, as the science 
of PFOS and PFOA progressed, 
we learned that these chemistries 
had the potential to build up over 
time. As part of our commitment context of applicable regulatory 
requirements and company 
policies and standards through 
the use of CAMMS dynamic audit 
checklists. In addition, CAMMS 
utilizes a risk assessment tool 
for prioritizing resources to 
implement corrective actions. 
EHS professional 
training
As part of our ongoing 
training efforts, in 2018 3M 
conducted monthly webinars 
for environmental, health, and Compliance analysis, 
documentation, and 
verification
In an effort to create more 
consistency in global auditing 
of locations, 3M has refined 
its Compliance and Auditing 
Management and Metric Systems 
(CAMMS). Primarily focused in 
the U.S. and Canada, CAMMS 
is a system for maintaining 
environmental compliance 
documents and determinations. 
It allows us to conduct internal 
compliance audits in the Environmental management
3M EHS audit locations, 2013- 2018
We will continue to drive 
environmental management programs 
across all our global manufacturing 
facilities. Starting in 2019, we will be 
globally deploying the programs and 
technology that make up the new 
EHS harmonization. We will also be 
implementing new global standard 
work and supporting tools in WIMS 
to put best practices in place across 
the globe for EHS management.
Beyond EHS management, we are 
committed to PFAS stewardship and in 
the future, we will continue to lead on 
the issues of science and stewardship 
around PFAS. Our activities are 
centered in three areas: 1) limit the 
footprint of PFAS on the environment, 
including our decisions to phase out 
the production of PFOA and PFOS 
and several product categories, 
well before other manufacturers; 
2) continued investments to 
remediate any contamination from 
our manufacturing facilities around 
the world; 3) continued investments 
in novel solutions to capture and 
recycle materials from our waste 
streams.  As with many of our 
other products, we have dedicated 
significant resources to study PFAS 
and continue to develop and share the 
science behind PFAS through internal 
research, external collaborations 
with universities, and interactions 
with government regulators.3M EHS audit locations, 2013-2018to environmental stewardship, in 
May 2000, 3M made the decision 
to phase-out of certain PFAS 
compounds, including PFOS and 
PFOA. We chose to stop production 
ahead of any regulatory requirement 
to do so and we shared our learnings 
with the EPA and our competitors.
3M is committed to responsible 
environmental stewardship and 
protecting natural resources. We 
work with federal, state, and local 
authorities regarding environmental 
aspects of our operations and 
are dedicated to acting with 
integrity in the way we treat our 
customers and the way we treat the 
environments in which we operate.
Globally, 3M has invested more 
than $625 million on research, 
technology, and cleanup efforts 
related to PFAS. More than $50 
million has gone toward installing 
carbon filtration systems for 
drinking water sources. More than 
$100 million has been invested in 
testing water sources around the 
country to better understand the 
quality of both groundwater and 
drinking water in communities. 
Additionally, in 2018, 3M worked 
with the state of Minnesota to 
establish the 3M Grant for Water 
Quality and Sustainability Fund.  This $850 million grant aligns with 
our commitment to improving lives 
through science and protecting 
the environment. The grant 
prioritizes investments in drinking 
water quality, groundwater 
recharge, and habitat improvement 
in the state of Minnesota. 
The Grant is managed by the 
Minnesota Pollution Control 
Agency (MPCA) and the 
Department of Natural Resources 
(DNR) through a Working 
Group. 3M is a member of the 
Working Group but the MPCA 
and/or the DNR have ultimate 
responsibility to determine the 
projects to be implemented.

How we work
Within each region, business, 
and division, results are reviewed 
quarterly and annually against goals 
and tracking metrics. Specialized 
teams work on a variety of projects 
and programs, ranging from basic 
office recycling to more complex 
projects such as developing and 
capturing intrinsic waste materials 
generated off a manufacturing line. 
Through an evaluation process, 
all aspects of material reduction 
benefits or risks are reviewed.
2025 Goal: Achieve 
“zero landfill” 
status at more 
than 30 percent of 
manufacturing sites. 
In addition to our waste reduction 
goal, we plan to increase 
repurposing, reusing, and recycling 
of potential waste materials to 
divert from landfill disposal. 
A location receives "zero landfill" 
status when it has gone a full 
calendar year without sending any 
waste to a landfill. It will continue 
to be a zero landfill location as long 
as no manufacturing operations 
waste is sent to a landfill. Waste, as 
defined here, does not include ash 
generated from 3M material sent to a waste-to-energy or incineration 
location controlled by a third party. 
Our actions
We have decreased our waste 
indexed to net sales by 32.4 
percent since 2005.
In 2018, we continued with our 
company-wide strategy on reuse, 
reduction, and internal recycling, 
as well as collaboration with 
our own technical community, 
channel partners, and civic 
and conservation leaders in 
communities where 3M operates. 
3M’s waste metrics include 3M 
manufacturing operations with total 
output greater than 4.54 metric 
tons per year (10,000 pounds), 
which represents 99 percent of 
sales value of production (SVOP) 
of our manufacturing locations. 
Composting materials from our 
manufacturing operations is an 
extremely small component of 
our manufacturing operations.
3M practices material minimization 
whenever practical to reduce the 
number of by-products generated 
and to reuse, recycle, or create 
energy from as much of the 
remaining material as possible. Between 2015 and 2019, 3M has 
reduced the amount of material 
sent for landfill and incineration by 
11.7 percent, indexed to net sales.
3M is also dedicated to operating in 
accordance with all regulations and 
managing waste materials safely 
and responsibly. All 3M locations 
are required to manage all returned, 
recycled, and waste materials from 
the time of generation until reused, 
recycled, treated, or disposed.
Maximizing beneficial 
use of raw materials 
Raw material usage is a 
measurement of overall product 
and process yield throughout our 
manufacturing processes and is a 
key metric for 3M. It is indicative 
of operational excellence in our 
product design and manufacturing 
processes. Our raw material 
usage includes the product, the 
process, and all by-products.
The diversity of manufacturing 
technologies, processes, 
and products at 3M provides 
opportunities for creative surplus 
material solutions for the company. 
Accurate identification and 
characterization of those materials 
is a continual education process and Our 
commitment
The world’s population is growing 
larger, living longer, and consuming 
more — which puts a strain on 
finite natural resources. To address 
this challenge, 3M continually 
looks for ways to recover, reuse, 
and recycle by-products and other 
waste material. We are moving from 
recyclable to renewable materials 
in our product and package design. 
Improving our raw material usage 
through product design and 
operational considerations provides 
cost benefits throughout our supply 
chain, in material use, energy, 
and transportation efficiency.
The 3M Waste Management  
Standard  applies to all 3M locations 
and provides a framework for 
managing all waste types from the 
time of generation until reused, 
recycled, treated, or disposed. The 
standard sets a baseline for several core waste program elements and 
encourages waste minimization 
and recycling whenever possible. 
Per the standard, each 3M 
location has a waste management 
coordinator who is responsible 
for coordinating appropriate 
waste training for all personnel. 
Compliance with all 3M and other 
regulated waste requirements is 
evaluated through the internal 
environmental auditing program.
Our Disposal of Chemical Waste  
Standard  calls for appropriate 
management and disposal of 
chemical waste to manage risks 
and protect the environment. 
This includes efforts to reduce 
the amount and hazards of waste 
materials generated, to recycle or 
reuse those materials whenever 
practical, and to control waste 
disposal through final disposition.2025 Goal: Reduce 
manufacturing waste 
by an additional  
10 percent, indexed

We’ll continue to drive “zero waste” 
thinking with our product designs 
and process technologies, as well 
as material reduction work at our 
manufacturing operations. Our 
definition of manufacturing waste 
for this goal includes materials 
sent to incineration and landfill. 
3M Corporate Environmental 
Operations identifies opportunities 
for efficiency improvement and 
measures progress toward raw

How we workAligning with 
Business 
Transformation
Driving continuous improvement 
in surplus materials management 
has been a multifaceted effort at 
3M. In addition to LSS, which helps 
us gain a better understanding 
of all the components involved 
and the total cost of materials, 
our Business Transformation 
platform and our global enterprise 
resource planning system bring 
visibility to each manufacturing 
location’s by-product. This allows 
facilities to better use LSS tools 
to identify and prioritize projects, 
and ultimately reduce waste.Raw materials
provides a foundational opportunity 
to further advance minimization 
and recycling at all our locations. 
One business’s surplus material, for 
example, may be another business’s 
raw material. As we continue to 
grow internationally, integrating 
consistent, yet resourceful, surplus 
material management practices 
in accordance to 3M standards 
remains a key objective.
As such, we continually look for 
ways to recover, reuse, and recycle 
by-products and other surplus 
material when feasible. And when 
it’s not, recoverable, reusable, 
or recyclable, we responsibly 
dispose of waste materials. The 
concept of maximizing beneficial 
raw material use is important 
both internally and externally to 
address the global challenge of 
resource efficiency and scarcity.
Zero landfill
Zero landfill is a goal that resonates 
with our local communities as well 
as our suppliers and customers. 
However, it has various definitions 
for different people and locations. 
We’ve spent a lot of time during 
our goal development process 
benchmarking peer companies that 
span relevant business sectors and industries. We’ve chosen a holistic 
definition: Zero landfill means no 
by-product is sent directly to a 
landfill from a 3M manufacturing 
location in a calendar year. 
Our location waste data are 
reported in a corporate database 
quarterly. This data is third-party 
validated at select locations and at 
the corporate level. We also require 
locations seeking this status to 
complete an internal assessment 
to assure accurate reporting.
By the end of 2018, 30.8 
percent of 3M locations had 
attained zero landfill status. 
We have multiple ways to meet 
our 2025 zero landfill goal, 
including product and process 
optimization, onsite and offsite 
recycling, composting, and 
waste-to-energy practices. As we 
monitor progress toward this goal, 
facilities listed will change due to 
operations (for example, facility 
closures, acquisitions, and sites 
missing zero landfill by one day of 
the year). To read how one plant 
became zero landfill, go here .Operational material 
management
A significant amount of effort in 
2018 focused on improving and 
evolving our Global Environmental 
Management Self-Assessment 
(GEMSA) program, which is 
now a core element of our EHS 
harmonization project . This 
program helps drive continuous 
improvement in EHS performance. 
Requirements were added for all 
sites to identify and implement 
projects to meet their internal goals 
for waste and water reduction. 
See additional information on the 
EHS harmonization project here .3P (Pollution 
Prevention Pays)
An industry first in 1975, the 3M 
Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) 
program is based on the belief  
that a prevention approach to 
pollution is more environmentally 
effective, more socially acceptable, 
and more economical than 
treatment. In the last 44 years, the 
program has prevented more than 
2.5 million short tons of pollutants 
and saved over $2.2 billion based 
on aggregated data from the 
first year of each 3P project. 
As part of the program, select 
projects are honored based upon 
their exceptional achievement.
Some highlights include:
 In 2018, 3M Personal Safety 
Division was recognized as 
division of the year along with 3M 
China as country of the year. Using kaizen events 
to improve flow of 
process streams
Kaizen is the Japanese word for 
“continuous improvement.” In 
2018, in a continuation of previous 
efforts, 3M EHS conducted several 
kaizen events, including facility 
walk-throughs, waste-by-cause 
analyses, and identification of 
circular uses for surplus materials. 
With our learnings from these 
events, we developed a Lean Six 
Sigma (LSS) Sustainability Tool Kit 
with templates and examples for 
replication across the company.
Part of the solution requires utilizing 
LSS within a location to segregate 
and manage material flow for 
material streams and analyze the 
availability of internal and external 
by-product handling alternatives.
As locations identify opportunities 
to divert material streams, we 
protect 3M’s reputation while 
managing by-product, and set 
up contracts with our haulers, 
recyclers, and waste-to-energy 
companies to confirm that our 
material is handled appropriately.forwardLooking 3M 2019 Sustainability Report3M 2019 Sustainability Report

How we work 153#improvinglives Raw materials
As we look ahead toward a more 
circular economy, 3M is focusing 
on initiatives that will help us 
engage more of the value chain. 
We’re looking to maximize product 
output and reuse waste in other 
locations, processes, and products. 
In addition, we are working with 
our researchers to create products 
to assure the effectiveness of raw 
materials. We’re also identifying 
and testing technologies that make 
our processes more efficient.  
Plans are also underway to expand 
the scope of the successful 3P 
program. We’re adding the ability 
to track 3P projects from the idea 
generation phase through project 
planning, execution, completion, 
and award recognition.  This will 
provide business leaders visibility 
to barriers that may jeopardize 
the success of footprint reduction 
projects, and assure the largest 
opportunities are addressed.

How we work Water
Water
Giving Earth’s most  
valuable natural resource  
the attention it deserves.
Our 
commitment
Applying 3M technology and 
working together, we have the 
strength to bring real, lasting 
improvements to water availability 
and quality on a global scale. 
Water is the most valuable 
natural resource on our planet 
 — supporting billions of plant, 
animal, and human lives and 
helping ecosystems thrive. Our 
consumption of this resource 
must be accordingly nurtured 
and thoughtfully managed. We 
recognize that reducing water 
consumption in our operations 
and improving water quality 
are important elements of 
optimizing our environmental 
stewardship. Quantitatively, the 
availability of water must meet 
the needs of current and future 
consumer demands. In addition, 
working to exceed local, state, and federal regulations with 
an eye toward the future.
Water is an important component 
for the manufacturing and support 
systems of several of our products. 
Because of this, 3M continues 
to actively understand, manage, 
and work toward reducing 
our corporate water footprint 
while providing innovative 
solutions to our customers.
We respect our ecological and 
ethical responsibility and have 
a vested interest in preserving 
and improving water availability 
and quality in the communities 
we serve and beyond.
3M’s Water Stewardship Standard  
outlines our commitment to 
water resources that secure 
social equity, economic growth, 
and environmental protection. 
Water resources include 
water intake, effluent water 
discharge, and rainwater. 2025 Goal: Reduce 
global water use by an 
additional 10 percent, 
indexed to sales.
3M operations must manage their 
water resources through alignment 
with regulatory requirements, 
conservation, and reuse, and 
reporting of water usage internally. 
2025 Goal: Engage 
100 percent of water-
stressed/scarce 
communities where 
3M manufactures, 
on community-wide 
approaches to water 
management. 
3M will partner with local 
communities to advance water 
recycling and conservation. 
Ultimately, we aim to help 
these communities build and 
manage their own clean water 
efforts into the future. Risk-mitigation 
planning
At 3M, we continually evaluate our 
approach to opportunity and risk.  
We believe the whole concept of 
risk management is an essential 
component of strategic planning. 
This includes a broad risk oversight 
by the 3M Board of Directors and its 
committees, with committee-level 
risk analyses reported to the full 
Board and executive-level internal 
auditor and Chief Compliance 
Officer appointed by, and reporting 
directly to, the Audit Committee.3M uses the definitions and 
tools established by the World 
Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD) to screen 
the company’s various locations 
and their water use with validated 
WBCSD water availability, 
population, and biodiversity 
information both on a country 
and watershed basis. In 2018, 
25 sites with annual water use 
equal to or greater than 1,000 
cubic meters were in water-
stressed areas as defined by the 
extremely high baseline water 
stress value, according to the 
WBCSD-Global Water Tool. ™ Each 3M site located in a 
water-stressed area is required 
to understand its water use, 
the associated business risks 
and impacts, and to work 
with local water resources to 
understand potential impacts on 
the surrounding area. It is also 
requested that those sites do 
water conservation planning, 
outlining current and future 
water conservation efforts. 
Annual stress-level screening 
evaluations are conducted for 
global operations using available 
updates from the water tool, an 
analysis of site operations, and 
water usage and local conditions.

How we workThe problem, however, is that 
the process requires a lot of 
heat. Previously, this heat came 
in the form of steam, but a team 
of scientists at the 3M plant in 
Tonawanda came up with a way 
to make sponges that uses less 
water. They repurposed hot 
water that previously had gone 
to the sewer. That water is now 
used to heat up the process step 
before steam is used, and then 
it’s recycled back to the start 
of the process to be reused.
The new process has led to a 25 
percent reduction in water usage 
at the Tonawanda plant. This also 
means less energy is consumed 
because less water has to be heated 
during the sponge-making process.
To learn more on 3M 
Tonawanda, go here .Water conservation
In 2018, we continued to evaluate 
policies, programs, and procedures 
while expanding our global 
internal systems. We use those 
findings to create, identify, and 
share best management practices 
related to water conservation.
We are continuing our efforts 
to implement water reduction 
projects at targeted facilities while 
evaluating external partnerships.
As we have for decades.
Case in point: Tonawanda, New 
York. In 1946, two chemical 
engineers and a chemist came 
up with a process for making 
artificial sponges to take the 
place of natural sea sponges.
157#improvinglives
Our actions 
We are continually evaluating 
our water use footprint with a 
consistent, company-wide focus 
on reuse, reduction, and internal 
recycling, as well as collaboration 
with our own technical community, 
channel partners, and civic 
and conservation leaders in 
communities where 3M operates.
3M’s total water usage includes 
sanitary, process, heating, cooling, 
remediation, and miscellaneous 
sources. Water usage data are 
tracked and reported annually on 
a global basis for manufacturing 
sites that produce greater than 4.54 
metric tons (10,000 pounds) of 
product per year. The reported data 
accounts for 99 percent of sales 
value of production (SVOP), which 
provides solid coverage of water 
use considered material to 3M’s 
operational environmental footprint.Total water consumption 
has decreased 39.4 percent 
between 2005 and 2018 indexed 
to corporate-wide net sales. 
Results also indicate that the 
largest share of 3M water use 
in operations is for processing 
products in manufacturing and 
heating or cooling of those 
processes and associated 
operations. We continue to 
improve our data accuracy through 
monitoring and measurement.
Our water conservation efforts have 
been achieved through recycling, 
reuse, product redesigns, and 
improvements to our buildings 
and manufacturing processes. 
A majority of our water-intense 
manufacturing operations are 
located in the U.S. and Europe, in 
areas that are not water-stressed 
or water-scarce. However, they 
also contribute significantly to 
our conservation efforts. As the 
company continues to grow 
globally, thoughtful consideration 
is placed on the type of operations 
and availability of water sources.Water

Climate  
and energy
Taking innovative steps to 
decarbonize industry.
Our 
commitment
Through the years, 3M has led 
industry in addressing both the 
challenges and the opportunities 
presented by climate change 
and energy conservation.
Our proactive leadership is best 
defined by five areas of action:
•  Executive-level commitment to 
these important topics and our 
related principles, commitments, 
and risk-mitigation planning efforts
•  Industry-leading efforts to 
reduce our own greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions
•  Extensive public policy 
engagement on both climate 
change and energy conservation
•  A decades-long track 
record of improving energy 
efficiency at our locations•  Serving our customers through a wide 
range of innovative products that 
help them improve energy efficiency 
and reduce their carbon footprints
Executive-level 
commitment 
We are committed to innovate to 
decarbonize industry, accelerate 
climate solutions, and reduce 
our own environmental footprint. 
This commitment was launched 
through our Strategic Sustainability  
Framework  (Science for Circular, 
Science for Climate, and Science 
for Community), on Investor Day 
2018, by Michael F. Roman, 3M’s 
Chief Executive Officer, and is 
rooted in our ambition to apply 
science for the greater good.
As a science-based company, 3M 
uses the World Resources Institute 
(WRI) / World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard to set GHG emission 
reduction targets. For this reason, 
we are incorporating the findings 
of the Special Report on Global 
Warming of 1.5°C, published by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) in setting our goals 
and actions. 1 This report, prepared 
by 91 authors from 40 countries 
and based on over 6,000 scientific 
references, finds that limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F) 
above pre-industrial temperatures 
would require “deep emissions 
reductions” and “rapid, far-reaching 
and unprecedented changes in 
all aspects of society.” Achieving 
this goal also would “reduce 
challenging impacts on ecosystems, 
human health and well-being.”

engagement 
3M endorses voluntary approaches 
to GHG emissions management. 
Any mandatory GHG emission 
reductions should be developed 
through international negotiations 
and follow these policy principles:
•  Apply broadly to countries 
or groups of countries, and 
GHG emission sources
•  Be guided by science-
based decision making
•  Utilize a consistent, market-
based approach
•  Encourage investment and protect 
intellectual property to facilitate 
technology breakthroughs
•  Include provisions for carbon 
emissions trading and/or alternative 
investment and compliance programs
•  Provide full credit for early 
reductions in GHG emissions
•  Balance multiple country-level 
priorities, including energy 
reliability and independence, 
national security, and economic 
growth and employment•  Include provisions that promote 
the efficient allocation of emissions 
reductions and assure all sectors 
contribute to reduction targets, 
with the effect of allowing fair 
competition and avoiding market 
distortions within industrial sectors 
or across national boundaries

Governance
The Board has delegated primary 
responsibility for the oversight 
of risks facing the company to 
the Audit Committee. The 3M 
Company Board of Directors Audit 
Committee Charter states that the 
committee will “discuss policies 
and procedures with respect to risk 
assessment and risk management, 
the company’s major risk exposures, 
and the steps management has 
taken to monitor and mitigate such 
exposures.” For the purposes of 
discussing climate-related risks, 
“substantive financial impact” 
means an event or circumstance 
that would individually or in 
the aggregate have a material 
adverse effect on the consolidated 
financial condition or operations

Board’s oversight
3M’s Science, Technology, and 
Sustainability (STS) Committee 
assesses and advances strategic 
growth areas, long-term 
investments, and inspired innovation 
opportunities. Committee members 
as of December 31, 2018, include 
Inge G. Thulin, Executive Chairman 
of the Board; Michael F. Roman, 
Chief Executive Officer; Nicholas 
C. Gangstad, Senior Vice President 
and Chief Financial Officer; John 
P. Banovetz, Senior Vice President, 
Research and Development and 
Chief Technology Officer; Gayle 
R.T. Schueller, Vice President and 
Chief Sustainability Officer.
Frequency on  
Board’s agenda
Sustainability is a topic at all levels 
of our company. On an annual basis, 
our Chief Technology Officer and 
our Chief Sustainability Officer 
report directly to the Board’s 
Nominating and Governance 
Committee on our Sustainability 
efforts. In addition, throughout 
2018 the STS committee met with 
increasing frequency as we created 
our new business strategy, known 
as our Strategic Sustainability 
Framework. This senior leadership 
team was highly engaged and While the Board’s oversight of 
risk is primarily performed by the 
Audit Committee, the Board has 
also delegated to other 3M senior 
management committees the 
oversight of risks within their areas 
of responsibility and expertise. 
The Environmental, Health, 
and Safety (EHS) Committee 
of 3M senior management 
provides input on climate and 
environmental related risks.
Integration into enterprise risk 
3M continually evaluates aspects of 
risk; our analysis has not identified 
all aspects of climate risk as an 
enterprise risk with a substantive 
financial impact. Our primary 
categories of enterprise risk are 
detailed in our Annual Report . 
Additional details on our enterprise

Corporate officer's oversight
In addition to members of the 
STS Committee, 3M’s Senior Vice 
President of Supply Chain, a direct 
report to the Chief Executive 
Officer, has the highest level of 
direct responsibility for assessing 
and managing climate-related 
issues. This person will carry on 
the company’s history of proactive 
leadership in addressing both the 
challenges and the opportunities 
presented by climate change and 
energy conservation. 
Identification  
and assessment
Managing risk requires integrating 
a multi-disciplinary, company-wide 
risk identification, assessment, 
and management process. Frequency of monitoring
3M will assess climate-related risks 
at least once every six months, and 
more often if a risk is considered to 
be more time-sensitive. Part of the 
assessment will be to evaluate risks 
that go beyond six years well into 
the future.
Risk factors
Regulatory  3M continually 
evaluates aspects of regulatory risk 
during regular business through 
new product development and 
continuous business improvement. 
3M’s operations are affected by 
national, state, and local laws 
around the world. 3M has made, 
and plans to continue making, 
necessary expenditures for 
compliance with applicable laws. 
3M is also involved in remediation 
actions relating to environmental 
matters from past operations 
at certain sites. Our analysis 
has not identified this climate 
factor as an enterprise risk with 
a substantive financial impact.
Technology  3M’s five business 
segments bring together common 
or related 3M technologies, 
enhancing the development of 
innovative products and services 
and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. We have 
operations in over 70 countries, 
bringing together a combination of 
our 46 unique technology platforms 
to produce over 55,000 product 
lines in nearly every country. Any 
risks from technology would be 
identified and mitigated through 
our New Technology Introduction 
(NTI) process, New Product 
Introduction (NPI) process, and 
continuous improvement program.
This product diversity enables 
3M to identify unique solutions to 
solve our customers’ challenges. In 
2018, 3M invested $1.82 billion in 
research and development to build 
upon our existing technologies 
to find innovative solutions for 
our customers' challenges. This 
unique combination of diversity and 
investment enables 3M to remain 
on the cutting edge of science 
and support our customers’ future 
needs as the climate changes. 
Our analysis has not identified this 
climate factor as an enterprise risk 
with a substantive financial impact.
Legal  The company’s future results 
may be affected by various legal 
and regulatory proceedings and 
legal compliance risks, including 
those involving product liability, 
antitrust, intellectual property, 
environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption 
laws, and other matters. The 
outcome of these legal proceedings 
is often difficult to reliably predict. 
For a more detailed review of 
this topic, see the discussion 
in Note 16 “Commitments and 
Contingencies” within the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements in The Company’s 
Annual Report  to Shareholders.
Market  Results are impacted by 
the effects of, and changes in, 
worldwide economic, political, 
and capital markets conditions. 
3M operates in more th an 70 
countries and derives approximately 
60 percent of its revenues from 
outside the United States. The 
company’s business is subject to 
global competition and geopolitical 
risks and may be adversely affected 
by factors that are beyond its 
control, such as slower economic 
growth, disruptions in financial 
markets, economic downturns, 
inflation, elevated unemployment 
levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, 
government deficit reduction, 
natural disasters, and other factors

Reputation  Around the world, 
customers rely on 3M to provide 
innovative solutions to advance 
companies, enhance homes, and 
improve lives. We are defined by 
more than just what we make — we 
are defined by how we do business: 
the 3M Way, always making the 
right choices for our company and 
our customers, and protecting our 
reputation in all we do.  Our analysis 
has not identified this climate 
factor as an enterprise risk with

Physical (acute and chronic) Every 
year, local crisis management 
teams at every 3M facility and

and update its Crisis Management 
Plan to reflect current conditions. 
It also performs a tabletop or 
actual crisis response exercise. 
3M Corporate Auditing and 
Corporate Security monitor facility 
compliance with the Corporate 
Crisis Management Program. 
3M mitigates supply chain risks 
through a variety of management 
practices, including multi-sourcing 
raw materials, pre-qualification of 
potential outsource manufacturers, and maintaining appropriate stocks 
of raw materials and contingency 
plans with key suppliers to assure 
allocation to 3M in the event of 
supply disruption. Our analysis 
has not identified this climate 
factor as an enterprise risk with 
a substantive financial impact.
Upstream  3M depends on various 
components, compounds, raw 
materials, and energy (including 
oil and natural gas and their 
derivatives) supplied by others for 
the manufacturing of its products. 
It is possible that any of its supplier 
relationships could be interrupted 
due to natural and other disasters 
and other events, or be terminated 
in the future. Risks from upstream 
suppliers are identified at the 
product level through the New  
Product Introduction (NPI ) and 
continuous improvement processes 
at 3M. An on-site assessment 
may be conducted, by 3M or 
third party, and any deficiencies 
are ultimately corrected through 
a Corrective Action Preventive 
Action (CAPA) process. Our analysis 
has not identified this climate 
factor as an enterprise risk with 
a substantive financial impact.
Downstream  Our analysis has 
not identified “downstream” 
as an enterprise risk with a substantive financial impact. 
Risks from downstream product 
uses are identified at the product 
level through the  Life Cycle  
Management (LCM)  process at 
3M, which evaluates the planned 
use and disposal of 3M products 
and identifies hazards and risks 
associated with the use and 
disposal of 3M products. Mitigation 
of these risks is highly diverse and 
product-specific. Our analysis 
has not identified this climate 
factor as an enterprise risk with 
a substantive financial impact.
Financial risks 
At 3M, we continually evaluate our 
approach to opportunity and risk. 
We believe the whole concept of 
risk appetite and tolerance is an 
essential component of strategic 
planning. This includes broad risk 
oversight by the Board and its 
committees, with committee-level 
risk analyses reported to the full 
Board and executive-level internal 
auditor and Chief Compliance 
Officer appointed by, and reporting 
directly to, the Audit Committee.
3M has operations in over 70 
countries, with a regionalized 
supply chain that enables more 
localized and diversified production 
of our products. This helps reduce our risk from local climate 
impacts on our operations. 
3M’s five business segments 
bring together common or related 
3M technologies, enhancing 
the development of innovative 
products and services and 
providing for efficient sharing 
of business resources. Our 
operations bring together a 
combination of our 46 unique 
technology platforms to produce 
over 55,000 product lines, which 
are sold in nearly every country.
We believe this governance of risks 
by Board committees, who share 
information with the full Board, 
is appropriate for a diversified 
technology and manufacturing 
company like 3M. 3M’s 10-K, 
Item 1A , outlines risk factors 
applicable to the company.
Financial opportunities
Financial opportunities include 
products and services and 
resource efficiency. Access to 
dependable energy supplies and 
energy efficiency directly affect 
all businesses and communities. 
Energy usage and climate concerns 
require systemic change. 3M is a 
diversified technology company 
providing innovative solutions to address these and other 
physical climate opportunities.
Metrics
We have established key metrics 
to measure and manage climate 
risk that go beyond compliance 
to thinking holistically about how 
our operations and products 
affect the world and every life in 
it. We report on historical periods 
to allow for trend analysis with a 
clear description of methodologies 
we use to calculate or estimate 
limitations and assumptions.

How we workClimate and energy
By conserving energy, reformulating 
products, and prioritizing 
opportunities, 3M has been 
able to achieve industry-leading 
GHG emission reductions. Other 
companies are setting goals to 
move closer to the achievements 
we have already realized.
2025 Goal:  
Help our customers 
reduce their GHGs 
by 250 million tons 
of CO 2 equivalent 
emissions through  
use of 3M products.
While 3M has made significant 
GHG emission reductions across 
our global operations, we realize we 
can make far greater contributions 
by helping our customers reduce 
their GHG emissions through the 
use of our products. For additional 
information on how we work with 
our customers, see Our Customers .we actively share information 
about our energy management 
program with external stakeholders 
such as suppliers, customers, and 
other interested organizations.
2025 Goal: Increase 
renewable energy to 
25 percent of total 
electricity use. 
Achieving this goal will mean 
adding nearly 800,000 MWh of 
renewable energy use globally. The 
primary sources of this renewable 
energy will be wind and solar.
2025 Goal: Ensure 
GHG emissions at 
least 50 percent 
below our 2002 
baseline, while 
growing our business. 
3M is in a leadership position due 
to our early actions to reduce our 
GHG emissions, which started 
in 2000. We are committed to 
continuing that leadership even 
as we grow the company in order 
to help our customers address 
the issue of climate change.Our actions
Energy management, 
inside and out
3M reviews its Strategic Energy 
Management Plan annually to 
prioritize programs and meet 
global goals. The plan uses input 
from stakeholders, including 
manufacturing directors, plant 
managers, operations employees, 
and executive management. 
Goals of the plan include to 
continuously improve results, 
leverage engineering expertise 
and advances, drive facility-
level efficiency improvements, 
maintain top management support, 
and protect 3M’s reputation.
Pubic speaking engagements 
and partnerships are integral 
elements of the plan. In 2018, 3M 
experts spoke at several energy 
industry conferences, including the 
Association of Energy Engineers 
(AEE), the Western Electricity 
Coordinating Council (WECC), the 
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE's), 
and the Better Buildings Summit. 
We are also one of 30 businesses 
and organizations that have formed 
the Minnesota Sustainable Growth 
Coalition, which is dedicated to 
defining and achieving a fully 
realized circular economy. A focus on energy 
from naturally 
replenishable sources 
As part of our 2025 goal to increase 
the use of renewable energy 
sources, 3M continues to expand 
wind energy operations. In 2018, 
we entered into contracts with 
two wind energy developers to 
off-take the electricity from their 
projects, Gunsight Mountain and 
Rocksprings, both located in Texas. 
In 2018, the electricity output 
from these two projects alone is 
now 26.8 percent of 3M’s total 
global electricity use, thereby 
achieving the company’s 2025 
renewable energy goal. With the 
goals we set in 2025, we’re raising 
the bar as part of our strategic 
focus on empowering Science for 
Circular, Climate, and Community. 
See the “looking forward” 
section for additional details.
Our renewable efforts don’t 
stop at the corporate level. Our 
facilities actively seek alternative 
energy sources, including active 
combined heat and power, solar, 
wind, and other projects, such 
as utilized excess steam. Learn 
more about the actions we’ve 
taken at one of our combined 
heat and power facilities here  and

SEP™ certification
The internationally recognized 
ISO 50001 standard, and the U.S. 
Department of Energy’s (DOE's) 
Superior Energy Performance 
(SEP™) certification program, 
help 3M locations become 
attuned to recognizing and seizing 
opportunities to increase energy 
efficiency in site operations, and 
move from delivering energy 
projects in a loosely organized 
fashion to a structured system of 
management. By integrating the 
systematic ISO-based framework 
of “plan-do-check-act” for the 
management of energy in on-site 
operations, our locations have 
seen savings in energy costs 
and consumption, expansion 
of employee engagement, and 
increased visibility to the tracking 
of site energy performance. 3M 
has been busy increasing its ISO 
50001 and SEP-certified profile, 
with 30 locations now certified 
or working toward certification 
under those two programs.Transforming the 
ways we use and 
evaluate energy
The doors of collaboration were 
once again opened during the 2018 
Plant Engineering Global Excellence 
(PEGE) & Energy Leadership 
Conference. For the second year in 
a row, with nearly 100 attendees, 
the conference was packed with 
a wide variety of valued subject-
matter experts and a focus on the 
importance of partnerships in the 
achievement of our Sustainability 
goals, as well as currently existing 
opportunities that assure energy-
efficient operations at our locations. 
Along with delivering those 
messages, external speakers yielded 
insight on Sustainability and process 
control from the perspective of 
leaders from other industries. 
Beyond this one-day summit-style 
event, we also conduct monthly 
web conferences for our global 
network, at which we share 
upcoming or changing regulatory 
requirements and best practices. #improvinglives1693M 2019 Sustainability Report3M 2019 Sustainability Report

How we workClimate and energy
From many 
perspectives, a 
productive year
Throughout the year, employees 
conducted treasure hunts at 
facilities to find conservation 
opportunities. Ten more sites 
joined in the hunt this year. These 
sites identified approximately 
$4.5 million (USD) in energy savings 
opportunities. Several more sites 
are scheduled in the future.
Evaluating new metering technology 
in 2018 aided in the identification 
of energy costs associated with the 
manufacturing processes and allow 
for better analysis of energy cost 
reductions during both production 
and non-production time periods.
An energy analysis tool was 
developed in 2018 for use by all 3M 
locations. The tool is designed to 
quickly analyze and identify energy 
projects and estimate payback 
periods. It uses actual site energy 
costs and weather data for analysis 
of energy costs in lighting, motors, 
makeup air, and compressed air.
The Lighting Challenge 
continued in 2018, focused on 
3M locations upgrading their 
lighting systems to light-emitting 
diode (LED) technology. At the end of 2018, just under 70 
percent of all global facilities 
had completed this challenge. 
Also, energy coordinators 
were named for each of four 
regions: Asia Pacific, Canada, 
Europe, and Latin America.

The Energy Excellence Awards 
honors individuals and teams 
that incorporate the goals of 
the Corporate Energy Program 
in engineering projects. The 
nominated projects and individuals 
actively demonstrate their 
commitment to include energy 
efficiency in the design of 
projects, in equipment selection, 
or in the use of alternative energy 
supplies. The award is one of 
global recognition within the 3M 
Engineering community. This year, 
we saw 29 project and individual 
award nominations total, from 
nine countries globally. In May 
2018, three awards were given 
at the 2018 Engineering Awards 
ceremony in St. Paul, Minnesota:3M Midway, 
Tennessee, U.S. 
Steve White, Amy Powell, Dennis 
Shipley, Charles Shipley, Richard 
Fox, and Johnny Ramey. The 
Midway team chose to attack 
energy efficiency indirectly. By 
focusing on process improvements, 
they were able to significantly 
increase the size of each of their 
furnace batch runs, without 
a corresponding increase in 
electricity input. Fewer batch runs 
also translated into a decrease 
in landfill scrap associated 
with each furnace load.

2018 Plant Energy 
Award
At the conclusion of each year, the 
Corporate Energy Management 
team recognizes the top facilities 
in our program for their results 
in energy metrics. To qualify, 
these facilities must demonstrate 
an active culture of energy 
management practices on-site, 
as evidenced by their delivered 
project savings, their energy 
team assessment score, and the 
resulting improved efficiency 
in energy intensity on-site. 
Eight platinum awards, 12 gold 
awards, and eight silver awards 
were presented to facilities with 
the most impressive results.

How we workClimate and energy
Direct (Scope 1) and  
indirect (Scope 2) 
greenhouse  
gas emissions 
Since 2002, 3M has reduced  
Scope 1 GHG emissions by 71.5 
percent, providing a direct and 
immediate reduction in our impact 
on the environment. During this 
same timeframe, we have achieved 
a 63.7 percent reduction in 
absolute Scope 1 and 2 location-
based GHG emissions. In 2018, our 
Scope 1 emission did increase. This 
is due to an increase in demand 
for products with high emission 
profiles.  We are actively working 
on projects to reduce the emission 
profiles of these product lines and 
our commitment to innovate to 
decarbonize industry, accelerate 
global climate solutions and improve 
our environmental footprint. Results 
of these efforts will be included in 
our 2020 Sustainability Report.
Since 2002, the 3M EHS 
Laboratory has calculated 3M's 
GHG inventory in accordance 
with the World Resources Institute 
(WRI) / World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) GHG Protocol Corporate 
Greenhouse Gas Accounting 
and Reporting Standard. The 3M EHS Laboratory maintains an 
accreditation to ANSI/ISO/IEC 
17025 through A2LA — a signatory 
to the International Laboratory 
Accreditation Cooperation Mutual 
Recognition Arrangement (ILAC 
MRA). Although it is not possible 
to put 3M’s GHG inventory 
methodology on the lab’s scope 
of accreditation, our calculation 
methodology has been improved 
by incorporating several quality 
system elements from ANSI/ISO/
IEC 17025 Standard, including:
•  Defined responsibilities and 
interrelationships of all key staff
•  Documentation of key 
personnel qualifications
•  Control over quality system 
documents and procedures
• Control of records
•  Corrective and preventive 
action system
• Internal audit program
•  Documented and approved 
calculation procedures
Every year, 3M calculates GHG 
inventory according to approved 
internal procedures that are updated as needed to agree with 
current calculation methodologies. 
However, whenever a methodology 
change is implemented, 3M will, 
wherever possible, recalculate 
prior year’s GHG inventories to 
assure that past and current-year 
GHG inventories are comparable. 
Where this is not possible, 3M 
will either call this out or assure 
that the difference is not material. 
These quality system elements and 
procedures coupled with a robust 
internal and third-party review 
of our emissions help assure that 
3M’s GHG inventory is aligned with 
the core principles of relevance, 
completeness, consistency, 
accuracy, and transparency. GHG 
emission reductions are achieved 
through a variety of methods: 
improving process and equipment 
efficiency, upgrading equipment, 
reducing our demand for energy 
use, increasing our use of renewable 
energy, and implementing and 
maintaining pollution control 
technologies. These methods, and 
more, are integral to the company’s 
overall success and assist us with 
the challenge of helping to address 
global climate change concerns.02468101214161820

How we work3M 2019 Sustainability Report
Air quality 
management 
An important component to 
3M’s Sustainability strategy is 
our commitment to improving 
air quality globally.
As a company that uses many 
solvent-based materials, 3M 
inherently releases volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs) 
from many of our manufacturing 
processes. Because of this, many 
of our locations require permits 
with rigorous VOC tracking 
requirements. Even where tracking 
is not required from a regulatory 
perspective, 3M voluntarily tracks 
VOC usage and emissions from 
major sources of emissions in order 
to identify further opportunities 
for reduction. 3M has developed 
internal programs to minimize 
its VOC emissions. We track 
and report emissions based on 
raw material usage, engineering 
estimates, and stack test data.
For many 3M manufacturing 
processes, nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
sulfur dioxide (SO₂), carbon 
monoxide (CO), hazardous air 
pollutants (HAPs), persistent 
organic pollutants (POPs), and 
particulate matter (PM) are emitted 
as products of combustion. These Climate and energy
GHG emissions 
attributable to 
our suppliers and 
customers (Scope 3) 
3M has been developing our Scope 
3 GHG emissions inventory since 
the publishing of the WRI/WBCSD 
GHG Protocol Corporate Value 
Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and 
Reporting Standard in September 
2011. We place a high value on 
decision making based on sound 
science. When the complexity of 
the supply chain does not allow for 
direct calculation, an input/output 
model calculation method is used.
We continually evaluate our 
methodology and auditing practices 
to assure meaningful, consistent, 
and accurate comparison of 
emissions over time. At this time, 
a base year has not yet been 
established for Scope 3 GHG 
emissions; see the looking forward 
section for additional information.Evaluating customer 
GHG emissions 
reductions
To track progress towards our 
2025 GHG customer goal, 3M 
has a process in place to develop 
reasonable estimates for avoided 
emissions associated with use of 
select 3M products. This estimation 
procedure is based on the ISO 
14064-2 standard for determining 
GHG emissions reductions. It 
provides a framework for the 
estimation of emissions from the 
3M product scenario (also referred 
to as the “project scenario”) in 
relation to a baseline scenario. 
We start by defining the boundary 
of the 3M product scenario as 
extraction from nature through 
the end of the product use phase 
(product end-of-life or disposal 
is included where reliable 
information is available). The GHG 
emissions for this scenario are 
then estimated using high-level 
estimates and average data (for 
example, manufacturing emissions 
may be determined based on the 
average energy use per pound 
of all products produced at a 
manufacturing location, rather 
than determining the emissions through detailed calculations using 
product-specific information). 
The same boundary is then used for 
the estimation of GHG emissions 
for the baseline scenario. Because 
the data sources may be different 
than the 3M product scenario, we 
apply conservative assumptions 
as needed, where conservative 
is defined as a choice that results 
in the minimum GHG emissions 
for the baseline scenario. For 
example, if emissions data is not 
available for the production of 
an intermediate chemical in the 
baseline scenario, we assume the 
emissions to be zero. In some cases, 
there is no equivalent to the 3M 
product.  The baseline scenario 
is the absence of the 3M product 
entirely. The result is a comparison 
that conservatively estimates the 
potential impact of the 3M product.  
Due to the estimated nature of the 
data used, the uncertainty for these 
studies is plus or minus 50 percent, 
which approximates data of fair to 
good quality as defined in the WRI/ 
WBCSD Product Life Cycle and 
Accounting Standard Quantitative 
Inventory Uncertainty Guide.
According to our calculations, in 
2018 alone our customers avoided 
emitting nearly 15 million metric tons CO 2 equivalents through use 
of select 3M product platforms as 
calculated in accordance with ISO 
14064-2 and 3M standard operating 
procedures. Since 2015, this is over 
41 million metric tons avoided CO₂ 
equivalent emissions through use of 
select 3M product platforms.  This 
avoidance represents only a portion 
of our product portfolio. Products 
including films, fluids, and food 
safety, are a few examples of the 
selected products included in this 
evaluation. In the future, the list will 
likely expand as a result of the new 
Sustainability Value Commitment . pollutants, which are listed on 
many environmental permits for 
specific facility operations, are 
tracked and reported externally 
where required by federal, state, 
or local regulations for individual 
locations. 3M internally tracks 
all fuel usage and calculates the 
combustion emission rates using 
accepted emission factors.

How we workImplementing  
and maintaining 
pollution control 
3M has made significant progress 
in reducing air emissions — at the 
source and by improving process 
efficiencies. Where emissions 
cannot be reduced within the 
process, 3M installs and maintains 
air emission control equipment 
as required by federal, state, and 
local regulations. We evaluate all 
equipment options, select those 
that are the most environmentally 
effective and cost-efficient, and 
strive to properly operate emission 
control equipment. Technologies 
include thermal oxidization, solvent 
recovery, carbon adsorption, 
biofiltration, electrostatic 
precipitators, baghouses, 
scrubbers, and cyclones. Ozone depleting 
substances
The Montreal Protocol is the first 
worldwide agreement designed 
to protect human health and 
the environment against the 
adverse effects of the depletion 
of the stratospheric ozone 
layer. The agreement identifies 
the list of ozone depleting 
substances (ODS) that are 
targeted for control practices, 
reductions, or total phaseouts and 
provides a phaseout schedule. 
In addition, some countries 
have established regulations 
regarding the management of 
refrigeration appliances.
3M has set forth requirements in 
order to provide a framework for 
how 3M operations are to manage 
their refrigeration appliances 
containing ODS in the context of 
applicable international protocols, 
local regulations, and current 
and future economic impacts. 
These requirements include 
conformance to the Montreal 
Protocol when applicable .In the coming year, 3M will be 
charting the pathway to 100 
percent renewable energy. 
Specifically, we will evaluate what 
will be required to improve all 
aspects of energy efficiency, what 
organizations can help us move to 
a total renewable energy portfolio, 
and what agreements with utility 
companies can help us reach our 
ultimate destination. For updates,

How we work Suppliers
Our 
commitment 
At each step in the supply chain, 
there are benefits (like employment 
and community-building) as well as 
the potential for negative impacts 
(like pollution or unsafe or unfair 
labor practices). Our commitment 
is to maximize the positives and 
mitigate the potential negatives by 
aligning our supplier expectations 
with our own corporate values. 
We expect our suppliers to 
be transparent about their 
environmental and social practices, 
provide improvement ideas, and work with us to transform our 
shared supply chain when needed.
We actively verify our new and 
existing suppliers’ performance 
against our expectations on a 
risk-prioritized basis, using our 
Due Diligence Management 
System, which is modeled 
after the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises.
Our Due Diligence Management 
System consists of the following 
elements, which aid with our 
continuous improvement efforts.Suppliers
Sustainability is a journey  
we take with everyone  
in our supply chain. To learn more about these topics, 
see our human rights section
•  Environment, health, and 
safety: We expect our suppliers 
to care as much about the 
safety of their workers and their 
communities as 3M does, and to 
implement proper procedures 
and controls to protect them
•  Ethics: Expectations align to the 
3M Code of Conduct  and hold 
our suppliers to the same high 
standards of honesty and integrity. 
Suppliers must prohibit any form 
of bribery and corruption, and 
prevent conflicts of interest
•  Management systems:  We 
expect our suppliers to establish 
processes to systematically conform 
to the 3M SRC as well as all legal 
requirements, and to commit 
to continuous improvement
The SRC is based on the 3M 
corporate values for sustainable 
and responsible operations and 
aligns with the 10 Principles of the 
United Nations Global Compact, 
of which 3M is a signatory. The 
SRC is also materially consistent 
with the Code of Conduct of the 
Responsible Business Alliance (RBA).The SRC, as with our previous 3M 
Supply Chain Policies, establishes 
3M’s expectations for new and 
existing suppliers anywhere in the 
world and for any supplied material 
or service. Our new supplier vetting 
process includes review of the SRC 
expectations and confirmation 
that their programs and practices 
as well as their subcontractors 
involved in the supply of products 
and/or services conform to 
standards consistent with the 
SRC. Our contract agreements 
have included expectations from 
our Supply Chain Policies and are 
now being updated to phase in and 
incorporate the SRC expectations.
We expect our suppliers to 
establish and implement their own 
relevant policies and programs 
in alignment with this SRC and 
to enforce these expectations 
with their own suppliers, thereby 
propagating our high Sustainability 
standards up our supply chains.
3M’s Vice President of Strategic 
Sourcing and Packaging 
Solutions is accountable for 3M’s 
Responsible Sourcing program. 
Executive leaders from Supply 
Chain, Compliance & Business 
Conduct, Strategic Sourcing, 
Legal, Sustainability, Human 
Resources, and Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) are 
updated at least twice a year, and 
sourcing leadership quarterly, on 
the program’s status. Both groups 
have the opportunity to provide 
input on the various program 
activities. Sustainability-related 
topics, along with supply chain, 
are discussed by the Science,  
Technology, and Sustainability  
(STS) Committee  and taken up 
annually as an agenda item for the 
3M Board of Directors, as required.
Supplier risk 
assessment and 
supply chain 
transparency
In addition to full compliance 
with all applicable environmental 
laws, we expect our suppliers 
to integrate environmental 
responsibility into their operations. 
Suppliers should work to minimize 
adverse effects on the community, 
environment, and natural 
resources while safeguarding 
the health and safety of workers 
and the public. Additional 
information can be found: here .
Our general supplier performance 
verification process begins with

The 3M Supplier Responsibility 
Code (SRC)  outlines 3M’s 
foundational social and 
environmental expectations in the 
following areas:
•  Labor: Requirements align with the 
3M Human Rights Policy  and include 
important concepts like freely chosen 
employment (no forced, bonded, 
or trafficked labor), restrictions on 
working age (no child labor), and 
appropriate working hours and 
wages. Setting these expectations 
helps assure our suppliers’ actions 
will reflect 3M’s values on human 
rights as well as the values underlying 
the International Labor Organization 
(ILO) and laws such as the California 
Transparency in Supply Chains 
Act, the United Kingdom Modern 
Slavery Act, and the U.S. Federal 
Acquisition Regulations (FAR) on 
forced labor and human trafficking. Transparency3M supply chain

How we workSuppliers
understand supplier programs and 
determine whether they conform 
to 3M expectations. An on-site 
assessment may be conducted, 
by 3M or a third party, to identify 
any deficiencies, which are 
ultimately addressed through an 
SRC Corrective Action Preventive 
Action (CAPA) process. CAPA may 
include announced or unannounced 
follow-up assessments.
If the assessment identifies gaps 
or findings, and if a supplier is not 
able or willing to resolve them, the 
CAPA would escalate to a corporate 
Supplier Corrective Action Request 
(SCAR). This assures appropriate 
resolution and conformance with 
3M’s requirements. If a supplier 
is unwilling to work with 3M on 
the identified gaps or unable 
to close the issues within a 
reasonable timeframe, alternative 
actions are determined with a 
cross-functional business team to 
elevate and resolve the situation.
Additional 
expectations  
for higher-risk  
supply chains 
In addition to the global SRC 
expectations for all suppliers, 
certain areas warrant additional and specific formal expectations to 
drive more sustainable, responsible 
practices. This includes our use of 
certain minerals with the potential 
to be sourced from conflict areas, 
our use of timber-based products 
and other plant materials (pulp 
and paper), and all new suppliers 
in the higher-risk countries, such 
as in the Asia Pacific region.
Focus: conflict 
minerals
Another prioritized area in our 
raw material supply network 
is the responsible sourcing of 
minerals. 3M deplores the violence 
and inhumane treatment that 
has occurred in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, adjoining 
countries, and other high-risk 
regions as defined by global 
regulatory bodies, and is committed 
to supporting responsible 
sourcing of 3TG (tin, tantalum, 
tungsten, and gold) from all such 
regions. Additional information 
can be found in our Conflict  
Mineral Policy , and in Supplier  
Direct, Supplier Requirements .
Focus: pulp and paper
3M has prioritized pulp and paper 
products as an area that warrants 
additional formal expectations because of potential environmental 
risks, such as deforestation and 
habitat loss; potential human rights 
issues, such as infringement of 
indigenous peoples’ rights; and 
potential unsafe labor practices. 
As a global paper purchaser and 
Sustainability leader, 3M is well-
positioned to positively influence 
practices throughout the forest 
products supply chain. We adopted 
our Pulp and Paper Sourcing  
Policy  in the spring of 2015 to 
set standards of excellence for 
our suppliers and their suppliers 
through all tiers of supply from the 
forest. Additional information on 
our commitment can be found on 
our Sustainable Forestry website .
Supplier diversity 
3M is committed to diversity and 
inclusion, which involves working 
with small businesses. We strongly 
encourage using diverse suppliers 
across our sourcing organization. 
We back up our commitment 
through initiatives that directly seek 
out diverse companies to support 
3M’s business needs. Equally 
important, we recognize that 
diversity is a core value that helps 
strengthen our competitiveness 
and provides opportunities for 
new ideas and fresh perspectives. 3M has a long-standing 
commitment to sustainable 
business practices and supporting 
the economic success of our 
communities, including working 
with both diverse and small-
business suppliers. 3M considers a 
diverse supplier any supplier who 
qualifies for one or more of the 
following classifications: Minority-
Owned Business; Women-Owned 
Business; and Small Business, 
including Small Disadvantaged, 
HUBZone, Woman, Veteran or 
Service-Disabled Veteran.
Our diversity program is about 
collaboration, communication, and 
active participation. Our supply 
chain organization is encouraged 
to actively participate in diversity 
outreach events. In 2018, 3M 
employees attended the Small 
and Disadvantaged Business 
Opportunity Council (SADBOC) 
Procurement Fair to identify 
additional diverse suppliers. We 
hosted two diversity events: the 
Small Business Liaison Officer 
Conference at 3M’s corporate 
facility and an outreach effort 
for small and diverse suppliers at 
3M’s Washington, D.C., facility.3M proactively reaches out to 
various organizations, including 
the National Minority Supplier 
Development Council (NMSDC), 
Women’s Business Enterprise 
National Council (WBENC), 
Metropolitan Economic 
Development Association (MEDA), 
Small Business Administration (SBA), 
and others. We also have a supplier 
portal that allows businesses 
to provide a portfolio of their 
capabilities, which is distributed 
to 3M’s sourcing organization.
3M establishes goals and regularly 
tracks the dollar value of goods 
and services purchased from small 
businesses and diverse suppliers 
in concert with goals set annually 
with the U.S. federal government as 
part of our subcontracting plan for 
federal government contracting.  
To achieve our goals, 3M  has 
implemented a four-part 
strategy aimed to:
•  Increase our spending with 
current diverse suppliers by 
reviewing our existing diverse 
suppliers by diversity category 
•  Identify additional diverse suppliers 
in our existing supply base by 
reviewing our top non-diverse 
suppliers by spending category•  Find “new-to-3M” diverse suppliers
•  Further disrupt the status quo by 
working to move some of our Tier 
2 spending to Tier 1 and focusing 
on diverse suppliers in our request 
for proposal (RFP) activity
In 2018, 3M spending with small 
businesses represented 26 percent, 
of which 4.6 percent were diverse 
suppliers. Our progress is routinely  
communicated to leadership 
across the organization. 
We remain committed to 
supporting small businesses and 
diverse suppliers by continuing 
to reassess elements of our 
approach, working across the 
industry to assure best practices.

How we workSuppliers
Our 2025 Goal: 
Drive supply chain 
Sustainability through 
targeted raw material 
traceability and 
supplier performance 
assurance.
We understand that our 
Sustainability impacts extend 
beyond our own operations. By 
purchasing raw materials and 
services from small and large 
companies all over the world, we 
participate in a global, complex 
supply chain. And it doesn’t 
stop there. Our suppliers have 
their own suppliers, extending 
back to the original source 
of each material we use.
Our actions
3M works with a broad, complex 
supply chain, consisting of 
over 78,000 suppliers in over 
300 subcategories in 110 
countries around the world. The SRC (Supplier Responsibility 
Code) Steering Team provided 
training in 2018 to more than 200 
assessors globally to assure a 
detailed understanding of 3M’s 
SRC expectations, processes, and 
supporting tools. The training 
covered each of the elements 
of the SRC, including labor and 
human rights, EHS, ethics, and 
management systems requirements. 
In addition, training materials were 
made available on 3M’s business 
partners website for suppliers 
to expand their knowledge in 
such topics as global bribery and 
corruption awareness; eliminating 
forced labor, slavery, and human 
trafficking from the global supply 
chain; and preventing corruption; 
and mitigating compliance risk for 
distributors and business partners.Supplier locations

How we workSuppliers
Verifying our supplier 
performance 
Although applicable to all suppliers, 
our supply chain risk assessment 
process focuses on prioritized 
suppliers, each of which must 
complete an SAQ and/or be 
subject to an on-site assessment 
as specified in our SRC. Forced labor and 
human trafficking
3M’s efforts to eradicate forced 
labor and human trafficking 
from its direct supply chains are 
discussed in more detail in 3M’s  
California Transparency in Supply  
Chains disclosure  and 3M’s United  
Kingdom Modern Slavery Act 
Statement . These disclosures 
communicate our commitment 
to legal and ethical practices 
through our membership in the 
United Nations Global Compact, 
in implementing 3M’s Code of 
Conduct, and by working with 
others to abolish human rights 
atrocities, especially as it relates 
to human trafficking, forced labor, 
modern slavery, and other related 
crimes. 3M is committed to doing 
our part to eradicate human 
trafficking in any form from the 
global supply chain. We have robust 
policies and systems in place to 
control these practices in our own 
operations and with our suppliers. 
As 3M sets a high bar for itself 
regarding labor and employment, 
it expects the same from its 
suppliers as articulated in the SRC.China prison labor 
allegations
In 2018, 3M launched an 
investigation into labor practices 
of suppliers in China based on 
allegations made in the Financial 
Times. We completed a document 
and record review of 3M suppliers 
in China and found no evidence 
of suppliers using prison labor for 
the manufacturing or packaging 
of 3M products. These findings 
were confirmed by an independent 
third-party onsite audit of 
suppliers based near the prison. 
Conflict

Forging ahead 
with continuous 
improvement
The 3M Conflict Minerals 
program, now in its sixth year, 
has gone through continuous 
improvement, based on learnings 
from past campaigns and external 
benchmarking that provided 
ways to optimize and increase the 
effectiveness of program activities.02,0005,0006,0007,000

Total numberAs part of our responsible 
sourcing expectations, in 2018 
3M refreshed its Conflict Minerals 
Policy and 3TG-related objectives 
for our suppliers. 3M expects its 
suppliers to adopt a similar policy 
and due-diligence management 
system and require the same 
of their suppliers to proliferate 
responsible sourcing practices 
throughout the supply chain.
In addition, 3M is an active member 
of Responsible Mineral Initiative 
(RMI), which develops tools and 
guidance for companies regarding 
conflict minerals. Our membership 
in RMI and various sub-teams such 
as the Smelter Engagement Team 
(SET), Due Diligence Practice 
Team, and Plenary Team enable 
3M to be involved in special 
activities like the Due Diligence 
White Paper update. The teams 
provide useful venues for 3M to 
offer its ideas and learn from other 
member companies as we all work 
together on this important journey 
of transforming our supply chains.
With the evolution of conflict 
mineral programs, 3M partnered 
with a third party to manage our 
2018 program outreach and data 
collection. The third-party platform 
automates the collection, validation, 
and centralization of data to support In the past eight years, over 6,300 
self-assessments or on-site audits 
of suppliers have been conducted 
in prioritized countries. Along 
the way, our assessment process 
has become more evolved and 
more comprehensive. In 2018, 
3M completed 550 assessments, 
which included the comprehensive 
RBA framework and expanded 
from 10 to 18 countries, covering 
every region of the world.Responding to risks, 
transforming our 
supply chains
We are constantly managing 
changes in supply markets both 
where there is an opportunity to 
extract value and defensively where 
necessary to mitigate risk and 
secure supply. As described earlier, 
we focus efforts on the salient 
issues in categories where human 
rights and environmental risks are 
the greatest. More broadly, we 
conduct robust risk prioritization 
to determine other suppliers we 
will engage via an assessment 
against our SRC, which includes 
policy and contract conformance.
3M has historically used industry 
indices to identify higher-risk 
supply chains and has adopted 
the use of a data-driven software 
solution in conjunction with 
industry information and Lean Six 
Sigma (LSS) tools to optimize and 
strengthen its risk management 
processes. The criteria matrix 
helps rank global suppliers, using 
multiple factors such as geographic, 
category, and business-critical 
elements to determine where 
assessments should be performed.#improvinglives1853M 2019 Sustainability Report3M 2019 Sustainability Report

basis for corporate assessments 
of material risks in 3TG supply 
chains and in particular with 
social and environmental risks.

Pulp and 
paper actions
As part of our regular review 
process, in 2018 we republished 
our Pulp and Paper Sourcing Policy 
that was published in 2015 and the 
supporting Policy Conformance 
Guidance Document. Changes 
to the policy included updating 
guidance links and resources, and 
adding details and clarification 
where beneficial. We also added 
translated versions of the policy 
and Policy Performance Guidance 
Document for three additional 
languages including Korean, 
Spanish, and Russian, bringing 
the total number of translated 
versions to seven languages. 
Pulp and paper policy 
implementation on 
the ground 
Throughout our policy 
implementation, we have seen 
several examples of marked 
improvements in responsible pulp 
and paper sourcing practices as a result of our engagement 
with suppliers. These include:
•  Meeting with suppliers’ senior 
corporate executives on the 
importance of assuring responsible 
and sustainable supply chains, and 
agreeing to collaborate on that goal
•  Suppliers establishing new 
positions within their companies
•  Significant increases in supply chain 
traceability and transparency 
•  Increased engagement 
by our suppliers with their 
upstream supply chain
Through an online survey, 3M 
suppliers can provide complete 
supply chain information all the 
way to the forest sources, or they 
can easily forward parts of the 
online survey to their suppliers 
(paper or pulp mills, for example) 
for completion. We aim to work 
with suppliers and peer companies 
to document as much of our global 
paper supply chain as possible, 
to amplify our efforts to mitigate 
risks, improve efficiencies, and 
drive sustainable practices 
throughout the supply chain.

we will work directly with indirect 
(Tier 2 and Tier 3) suppliers on 
policy conformance verification 
work, with a goal of involving our 
direct (Tier 1) supplier(s) in these 
activities whenever possible. 
With the help of our third-party 
provider, we have conducted 12 
field assessments so far across 
all regions, covering more than 
14 million hectares. Four of those 
assessments were of Tier 2 pulp 
mills, which were also attended by 
a Tier 1 supplier. 3M’s participation 
on supplier field assessments with 
our third-party provider helps 
us to understand firsthand the 
challenges faced by pulp and paper 
companies and forest managers 
around the world. This in turn 
enables us to actively participate in 
developing solutions and advancing 
conversations about responsible 
sourcing and sustainable forestry.
3M and our third-party provider 
are committed to working with 
suppliers to promote protection 
of high conservation values in the information we obtain from our 
supplier surveys and combine 
that with geography and industry-
specific knowledge to conduct 
“desktop” risk assessments of 
our supply chains. We use these 
assessments to prioritize further 
engagement to learn more about 
our suppliers’ responsible sourcing 
and sustainable forestry practices. Members of our European 
Government Affairs team have 
been closely aligned with industry 
and government to understand the 
scope, impacts, and timing of the 
new European regulation. The team 
has proactively assessed potential 
applicability so 3M will be best 
prepared to implement the new rule.

the forests to provide wildlife 
habitat, ecosystem services, and 
natural beauty for generations to 
come. This is accomplished through 
field assessments of supplier 
practices, deep engagement with 
forest managers and scientists, 
and a focus on identifying 
innovative management practices. 
To maximize the likelihood of 
success, these actions require 
collaboration with industry, 
indigenous peoples and local 
communities, with the aim of 
restoring balance to the relationship 
between people and nature.
Each assessment results in a 
comprehensive report detailing the 
supplier’s performance against our 
policy requirements, and action 
items to address any performance 
gaps. We expect each supplier 
to develop corrective action 
plans with reasonable timelines 
and continue to collaborate with

Each year 3M sourcing 
professionals nominate exemplary 
suppliers to be recognized for 
world-class performance, based 
on strategic support, contract 
compliance, actions taken to 
improve 3M’s competitiveness, 
and overall supplier performance.
In 2018, 3M recognized over 30 
suppliers among thousands in 
its global supply base for world-
class performance in providing 
products and/or product. They 
were honored at regional events 
in Canada, EMEA, Latin America, 
and the U.S., as well as local 
programs in Japan and Korea.

of the Year Award here .3M values continuous improvement 
and is conducting a Lean Six Sigma 
project to improve the efficiency 
and effectiveness of the SRC 
process and toolsets. The project is 
global in scope and will positively 
impact the methodology, resources, 
and results of the activity.  
We recognize there are risks 
in the supply chains of many 
materials.  Through strategic 
partnerships, we are continuing 
to increase our ability to mitigate 
risks through collaboration. For 
example, RMI is actively working 
on formulating risk mitigation tools 
for the cobalt industry. We will 
increase efforts with providers 
of pulp and paper, understanding 
and evaluating conformance with 
3M’s environmental and social 
expectations, which will include 
field visits. 3M is committed to 
expanding our due-diligence efforts 
for higher-risk materials to further 
mitigate risk to our business and

and helping our customers reduce 
their greenhouse gas emissions. We 
have also set 2025 goals around 
building a diverse workforce and 
educating individuals on worker 
and patient safety in health 
care and industrial settings.Not only that, but we have made 
such significant progress on the 
2025 goals that we’re raising 
the bar.  This includes our new 
product goal as an example of 
the aggressive targets we’ll be 
setting in the coming months as 
part of our strategic focus on 
empowering Science for Circular, 
Climate, and Community. 
This drives not only continued 
focus on social and environmental 
stewardship, but ideation on 
better ways to innovate for 
greater positive societal impact.Our new product goal is 
a commitment that every 
new product entering the 
development process in 
2019 is required to uphold 
a Sustainability Value 
Commitment.

What we create Our customers
Our  
customers
Customers are at the  
center of 3M decision making.
Our 
commitment 
Whether it’s technology, 
manufacturing, global capabilities, 
or brand, we are committed to 
connecting our fundamental 
strengths to customers. We 
engage them. We delve into their 
processes, their problems, and 
their promises to their customers. 
We bring our technology to them, 
along with a deep domain expertise, 
and we deepen it further when 
we work side by side with them. 
In the process, we not only meet 
their expressed needs — we are 
often able to identify and address 
unarticulated needs. In both cases, 
we create solutions for them 
and, at the same time, innovative 
growth platforms for 3M.
Additional details can be 
found in our innovation 
management section:  here .Creating  
competitive 
advantages for 
customers, and  
for 3M
At 3M, we talk about how many 
of our products are specified or 
regulated. Specified: designed 
for the customer. Regulated: 
meeting specific performance 
and requirements. Working in 
both categories carries us through 
multiple commerce channels, 
distribution models, direct models, 
retail models, and, increasingly, 
e-commerce. Throughout, we 
maintain a customer-first focus, 
making sure we're in a position to 
deliver value where they want it, 
when they want it, how they want it. Building Sustainability 
into all new products
Where many companies view 
the topic of Sustainability in 
product development as a 
challenge, at 3M we have taken 
an aggressive approach, working 
to identify and understand future 
Sustainability needs, and to 
expand our portfolio of products 
with Sustainability advantages.
By embedding Sustainability into 
our R&D process, our brands, and 
the mindset of our suppliers and 
customers, we’re able to move 3M’s 
growth to new levels and advance 
our commitment to improving our 
business, our planet, and every 
life. Additional information can be 
found in Our Products  and 3M’s 
Sustainability Value Commitment .2025 Goal: Invest 
to develop more 
sustainable materials 
and products to help 
our customers reach 
their environmental 
goals.
We recognize some of our greatest 
positive impact can be realized by 
helping our customers improve 
their environmental footprint. For 
that reason, an increased focus 
on delivering more sustainable 
materials and components 
is core to our innovation and 
Sustainability strategy.
2025 Goal: Provide 
training to five million 
people globally on 
worker and patient 
safety.
We will continue to support 
empowerment and enrichment 
for global health and safety issues 
through our commitment to improve 
the health and safety of people 
worldwide. To measure progress 
against this goal, we will track the 
number of training experiences 
delivered by our Health Care and 
Personal Safety Academies.Our actions
We have four strategic priorities 
that deliver value for our 
customers: portfolio management, 
transformation, innovation, 
and people and culture.
In all, we work to understand 
our customers’ business models, 
what they have promised their 
customers, what our role is in the 
value chain, and how we can help 
them deliver on their promises. It is 
our Vision, as we aspire to advance 
every company, enhance every 
home, and improve every life.
Portfolio 
management: 
leveraging our 3M 
Value Model
In 2012, we introduced a new 
framework for thinking about 
portfolio management, looking 
across the entire 3M portfolio with 
an eye toward relative strategic 
and financial attractiveness. At 
that same time, we consolidated 
from 40 to 23 divisions in 
order to create more value and 
relevance for the customer. 
Today, portfolio management 
continues to be a key to the way we’re reshaping the company, 
how we're prioritizing businesses 
to emphasize the greatest value 
creators in our portfolio, and 
how we're looking at potential 
acquisitions, divestitures, and 
partnerships. It’s about accelerating 
into the future, driving greater 
and greater prioritization.
Transformation: 
continuing a critical 
journey
In 2018, we made great progress 
in our transformation journey, 
which leverages our strengths 
in technology, manufacturing, 
global capabilities, and brand to 
provide a more positive overall 
experience for our customers. 
Specific accomplishments:
•  Successfully deployed ERP 
(enterprise resource planning) 
systems in Europe and U.S.
•  Simplified, standardized, and 
redesigned business processes
•  Advanced streamlined,  
end-to-end engagement 
with customers
•  Created value through 
new service models#improvinglives1953M 2019 Sustainability Report

What we create Our customers
Moving forward, we will 
work to enhance customer 
service, increase value creation, 
leverage ERP capabilities, 
streamline deployments, and 
utilize data and analytics.
Innovation:  
customer-inspired
Technology itself is not sufficient 
to create differentiated products 
and solutions. Our innovation 
truly comes from the confluence 
of customer and market insights, 
technology, and our culture of 
collaboration and entrepreneurship. 
We strive to invent things that are 
not only new, but useful. That is 
why 3M scientists work directly 
with customers to solve their 
unique challenges. We take the 
time to get to know them, to learn 
how they live and work — and to 
understand what we can do to 
improve their lives. Collaborating 
with customers assures us we 
are in tune with their needs. Our 
most successful products are 
infused with strategic customer 
insights throughout the entire 
product development process. Customer

TechnologyInsightsPeople and culture: 
collaborating and 
creating locally
When collaboration results in 
meaningful innovation — solving 
real problems — it becomes 
amazing and awe-inspiring. To 
get there, we believe it’s essential 
to be close to our customers. 
That’s why 3M has 54 customer 
technical centers across the 
globe, where our customers can 
experience firsthand the breadth 
of 3M technologies and how they 
can benefit from them. That’s also 
why we have labs in 36 countries, 
where our scientists work closely 
with our customers to develop 
solutions for their specific problems.
Some of the problems addressed 
in our technical centers and labs 
are connected to regional and local 
issues. Globally, for example, rapid 
population growth in urban areas 
is creating challenges related to 
energy efficiency, clean water, and 
environmental protection. Our local 
scientists leverage 3M technologies 
to develop relevant solutions that 
are unique to their region, often 
collaborating with local customers. 
Additional details can be found in 
our innovation management section .Education that raises 
everyone’s bar 
Proper use of health and safety 
products is critical to infection 
prevention, personal safety, and 
overall health. Building on our 
existing customer education 
programs, 3M has created training 
libraries that are accessible where, 
when, and how customers want 
them: for on-demand education, 
live webinars, in-person events, 
and education resources. 
We deliver educational content 
to health care professionals at 
hospitals and clinics, professional 
conferences, and via online 
webinars — all around the 
world, through 3M ℠ Health 
Care Academy . This is not only 
important to helping customers 
get the most out of our products, 
it’s our commitment to helping 
professionals improve outcomes 
for their patients and customers.The same holds true for our 
Personal Safety Division . In a rapidly 
evolving business and occupational 
health and safety environment, our 
education and training programs 
can instruct workers on workplace 
safety hazards and health risks, 
personal protection equipment 
(as regulated by the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration, 
or OSHA), and proper use and 
maintenance of 3M products.
In 2018, total number of training 
instances was 89,900. This only 
includes our eLearning platform 
and a couple in-classroom events. 
Moving forward, we are working 
to further expand our record 
system for in-classroom events.

Innovation taken to 
a higher level: our 
Sustainability Value 
Commitment
In 2018, we took the biggest 
step yet in viewing innovation 
through a Sustainability lens: 
We announced that beginning in 
2019 3M products entering the 
new product commercialization 
process will be required to 
include their Sustainability 
impact and how it drives impact 
for the greater good. This is an 
ambitious commitment, given 
that 3M launches approximately 
1,000 new products each year.
The new requirement is part of 
3M’s commitment to Sustainability 
in fulfilling its role as a purpose-
driven business, and builds on our 
legacy of Sustainability leadership 
among global companies.
Examples of a Sustainability Value 
Commitment in new 3M products 
include materials reduction, 
recyclability, energy and water 
savings, responsible sourcing, 
renewable materials, and/or reuse 
appropriate for the specific product.As a large and diverse global 
science company with customers 
spanning many industries and 
global markets, we have the 
opportunity to make an even 
greater impact in Sustainability. 
As part of our strategic focus 
on empowering Science for 
Circular, Climate, and Community, 
we will work to design a world 
where 9 billion people can 
thrive by applying boundaryless, 
collaborative science to reinvent 
the products, processes, and 
systems that improve every life.
We will continue to leverage our 
diversified technology portfolio to 
create innovative solutions for our 
customers and markets. We are 
evolving our technology platforms 
for the changing and anticipated 
needs of high-growth markets, and 
we are augmenting our material 
science expertise with digital, 
where appropriate, to create value 
for our customers and for 3M.
In 2019, we will also apply the 
new 3M Sustainability Value 
Commitment to new product 
commercialization, across the 
board, and across the globe. This commitment also includes 
products with a core purpose of 
helping to solve an environmental 
and/or social problem, such as 
improving air quality, reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions, and 
improving worker and patient safety 
in health care and industrial settings.
3M’s new product requirement 
will have a global impact, starting 
with our operations in the 70 
countries where we operate 
and in the products we sell in 
nearly every country. It will 
also help our customers reach 
their own Sustainability goals. 
Most important, it impacts 3M 
employees. When you work for 
3M, you are changing the world. #improvinglives1993M 2019 Sustainability Report

What we create Innovation management
Our 
commitment 
At 3M, asking “what if” is our way 
of life. We are a company rooted in 
scientific exploration and discovery. 
We believe that every problem 
has a solution. All our businesses 
are connected by our fundamental 
strengths — technology, 
manufacturing, global capabilities, 
and brand — which allow us to 
invent, build, and sell products 
across our vast global network. 
R&D is our heartbeat. We continue 
to invest in scientific research and 
product development in close 
partnership with our customers 
and the marketplace. R&D fosters 
a constant stream of unique 
and cutting-edge products that 
drive organic growth. In fact, in 
2018, we invested 1.8 billion 
(USD), or nearly 5.5 percent 
of our sales, back into R&D.Another reason for our success 
is innovation: There are no silos 
here. Our 46 technology platforms  
are shared and combined across 
businesses and regions to invent 
unique products for a variety of 
industries. No single business 
owns any of these platforms. They 
are managed by the company 
and can be leveraged by any 
of the businesses to serve their 
respective customers or markets.
Our “15% Culture” — instituted six 
decades ago — inspires creativity, 
risk-taking, and collaboration. It 
gives 3M employees the freedom 
to take risks and learn from 
our mistakes. That freedom is 
essential to scientific discovery. 
3M employees have the freedom 
to spend 15 percent of their time 
on projects that interest them. 
Out of that time come new ideas 
that might eventually become 
successful new 3M products. Learn 
more about our 15% Culture here .3M has earned more than 113,000 
patents over the years, a testament 
to the strength of our innovation 
engine. Every year, on average, 
3M earns 3,000 patents.
The policies and standards that 
guide the design, manufacturing, 
marketing, and sale of 3M products 
share a common foundation: 
the 3M Code of Conduct .
The Code of Conduct is an 
overarching guide to the 
appropriate decisions and actions 
of 3M individuals and teams 
as they go about their work. It 
defines our values and the 
responsibilities 3M employees 
and 3M suppliers must meet. 
Under this broad umbrella of 
values are principles that more 
specifically outline what 3M 
believes is the ethical approach to 
various work situations, including 
situations that involve innovation 
management of 3M products.Innovation 
management
Applying science to  
solve for Sustainability.Product Safety, 
Quality, and 
Stewardship Principle 
Our customers depend on 3M’s 
products to advance, enhance, 
and improve their companies, 
homes, and lives — and we have 
a responsibility to live up to those 
expectations. For this reason, we 
must strive to produce only the 
highest-quality products. Every 
item we sell must meet rigorous 
quality standards and must be 
safe for its intended use. 
As detailed in our Product Safety, 
Quality, and Stewardship Principle , 
located under  3M’s Code of 
Conduct – Be Fair , 3M employees 
must know and follow all applicable 
laws, regulations, and 3M policies, 
standards, and procedures for 
product safety, quality, and 
stewardship and must report and 
respond to concerns diligently. 3M 
management is responsible for 
addressing reported concerns and 
assuring that 3M employees are 
properly trained in applicable laws 
and regulations and 3M policies, 
standards, and procedures. 
Further, we take it as our 
responsibility to produce products 
with superior environmental performance across their entire 
life cycle, including product 
reuse and repurpose, and to work 
with our suppliers and business 
partners so that their operations 
support these same objectives.  
Product Safety, 
Compliance, and 
Stewardship Policy 
3M’s Product Safety, Compliance, 
and Stewardship Policy  
underscores our commitment 
to commercializing and selling 
products that are safe for their 
intended uses, compliant with all 
applicable Environmental, Health 
and Safety (EHS) regulations and 
3M expectations, and developed 
with a goal to continuously 
improve the EHS performance 
of products and corresponding 
manufacturing processes.
Each 3M business group must 
maintain processes for the 
effective global review of 
product safety, compliance, and 
stewardship requirements. This 
includes consideration of EHS 
aspects relevant throughout the 
life cycle of a product, including 
raw material selection, product 
design, formulation, manufacturing, 
marketing, sale, intended and anticipated use or misuse, recycling, 
reuse, repurpose, and disposal. 
The process must meet and 
maintain continuous compliance 
with applicable national, regional, 
and local regulations, and 3M 
expectations. These business 
processes must be incorporated 
into New Product Introduction 
(NPI) and Management of 
Change (MOC) procedures; 
and product safety, compliance, 
and stewardship requirements 
must be integrated into the 
development, commercialization, 
and sale of 3M products.
In addition, we have established 
an internal standard to assure 
uniform compliance globally for 
the manufacturing, sale, testing, 
and promotion of medical 
devices, food or drink, food or 
drink supplements, food or drink 
additives, drugs, and cosmetics for 
use in or with humans or animals.#improvinglives2013M 2019 Sustainability Report

What we create Innovation management
Chemicals 
Management Policy
3M is a science-based company 
committed to applying our 
scientific expertise to improving 
lives. Helping people live safe 
and productive lives is important 
to 3M — for our employees, our 
customers, and everyone living 
on the planet. Chemicals are 
essential for producing 3M’s broad 
range of products, and part of 
3M’s role in helping people live 
safely is effective and responsible 
chemical management.
In 2018, we adopted the new 
Chemicals Management Policy , 
which replaces existing policies 
and standards on chemicals 
management. This commitment 
reflects the evolving values of 3M 
and our stakeholders. Under this 
policy, to continuously improve the 
environmental, health, and safety 
(EHS) attributes of our products, 3M 
has identified specific chemicals 
whose use in products and 
manufacturing processes is subject 
to approval by the Corporate 
EHS Committee. In 2018, 3M has 
targeted 31 specific chemicals on 
which we are reducing our reliance. 
Our Managed Substance List goes 
beyond the 31 targeted substances. 
Any substance being considered for use in 3M products and processes 
requires prior corporate approval. 
Advertising 
and Product 
Representation 
Principle
3M’s reputation as a responsible 
company extends to the products 
and services we offer and how 
we represent them. 3M must 
communicate honestly and 
accurately about 3M’s products 
and services. Learn more on this 
by visiting our Advertising and 
Product Representation Principle .
It’s our policy to represent 
our products truthfully, fairly, 
and accurately in all sales, 
advertising, packaging, and 
promotional efforts. All product 
claims must be substantiated 
and technically accurate as 
specified by the Advertising and 
Product Representation Policy . 
3M’s Environmental Marketing 
Claims Support Team assists 
businesses in the substantiation of 
environmental product claims and 
comprises laboratory scientists, 
legal staﬀ, life cycle management 
professionals, and others with 
marketing and business expertise.Hazard 
communication 
and composition 
disclosure 
Communicating the potential 
hazards of 3M materials supports 
3M’s core values and is an integral 
part of keeping stakeholders 
informed about 3M materials. The 
vehicles for communicating these 
hazards and product chemical 
components include safety data 
sheets (SDS) , product labels, 
product literature, instructions for 
use, transportation classification 
documentation, and other 
communications tools. Each 
business group must evaluate the 
potential hazards of 3M materials 
and transmit, in local country 
language(s), information about the 
hazards to employees, contractors, 
and customers; it must meet all 
regulatory requirements and 3M 
standards and guidelines; and it 
must promote informed decisions 
about the materials’ proper and 
safe handling, use, and disposal. Alternatives to  
animal testing 
3M is a major advocate for the use, 
wherever practicable, of alternative 
test methods (non-animal) to help 
develop safe products. 3M is 
currently utilizing many of these 
alternative methods, such as 
computational toxicology and in 
vitro testing using isolated tissues 
or cells. We are also investing in the 
internal and external development 
of new methodologies that 
replace animal testing. Where 
animal testing is required, we 
follow our Animal Welfare in  
Testing and Research Policy . 
Human Subject 
Research Policy
Our Human Subject Research  
Policy  protects the rights, safety, 
and welfare of human subjects 
who participate in 3M supported 
research. All supported research 
involving human subjects must be 
conducted in accordance with all 
applicable national, regional, and 
local ethical and legal rules and 
regulations, and must be conducted 
in accordance with three principles, 
as described in the Belmont Report: 
respect for person, justice, and 
beneficence (or, do no harm).3M’s Sustainability 
Value Commitment
Beginning in 2019, all new 
products entering the new product 
commercialization process will be 
required to describe their product’s 
Sustainability impact and how it 
drives impact for the greater good.
A Sustainability Value Commitment 
in a new product is a clear 
demonstration of how the product 
incorporates environmental and/or 
social factors to contribute to our 
aspirations laid out in our Strategic 
Sustainability Framework. Example 
of consideration including the 
following: reusability; recyclability; 
energy, waste, and water savings; 
and responsible sourcing and/or 
renewable materials appropriate 
to the specific product throughout 
a product’s life cycle. 
A Sustainability Value Commitment 
can also stem from a core purpose 
in which the product helps to solve 
an environmental and/or social 
challenge — such as improving 
air quality, reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions, and improving 
worker and patient safety in health 
care and industrial settings.
The impact of 3M’s new product 
requirement is global in scale: 3M launches approximately 1,000 
new products each year, with a 
significant fraction of its revenue 
generated from products released 
in the past five years. Beyond 3M’s 
own operations, a primary reason 
for the goal is to help customers 
achieve their Sustainability goals. 
This new product goal creates even 
more opportunities to collaborate 
with customers on solutions that 
improve lives around the world.#improvinglives2033M 2019 Sustainability Report

What we create Innovation management
Our actions
The challenges we must tackle 
for a sustainable future don’t 
always operate by clear rules 
or methods, but we see them 
clearly. They are broad. They are 
interrelated. They are solvable. And 
we know science can help tackle 
them. We at 3M have the unique 
opportunity to apply our passion 
and collaborate enterprise-wide.
Great brands  
are based on an 
enduring idea that 
drives their purpose. 
At 3M, we apply science to 
improve people’s everyday lives. 
But just as society’s problems 
continue to evolve, so does our 
science. We are relentlessly 
evolving and adapting our 
technology to continue to help 
people by solving their problems 
of today and tomorrow.
Our 46 technology platforms, the 
3M periodic table of elements, 
showcase the building blocks 
of 3M. They are elements of 
progress. Alone, they are each 
unique. Combined, we make 
solutions for our customers.The 3M periodic table will 
evolve to assure future-forward 
technologies aligned with our 
strong foundational expertise. This 
includes our commitment and 
expertise in making products with 
less materials, improving ours and 
others' environmental footprint, and 
emphasizing our use of science 
to create a more positive world.
Unique and 
differentiated value
The power of 3M is in the way 
we connect our fundamental 
strengths to customers. Those 
strengths are our capabilities 
and brand. They define us as an 
enterprise and combine to build a 
business greater than the sum of 
its parts. The power of 3M arose 
from our deep understanding of 
what it is that differentiates us in 
our performance, across every 
business in our enterprise. It truly 
reflects how we’re linked together 
in our portfolio even though we 
might operate in multiple markets. 
It’s about our technology, but 
not just standalone science: It’s 
technology supported by deep 
intellectual property and combined 
with multiple other technologies 
to enable us to do unique things 
with and for our customers.

What we create Innovation management
3M power is also about our 
manufacturing strength. We’re 
differentiated and advantaged in 
the marketplace through in-house 
3M plant and facility ownership 
that also leverages 3M intellectual 
property. A third of our intellectual 
property sits in manufacturing, 
much of it in trade secrets, enabling 
us to deliver higher-quality, better-
performing, more competitive 
products in the marketplace. 
True global capabilities require more 
than just presence in international 
markets. They require the skills 
of our international organization 
to execute our business models 
and enable us to enter those 
markets successfully — to take 
our fundamental strengths and 
applications almost anywhere 
in the world. We have sales in 
nearly all countries, with two-
thirds of our workforce and sales 
professionals working outside 
the U.S. By employing integration 
and collaboration across our 
businesses, geographies, and 
scientific disciplines we effectively 
and efficiently bring new ideas 
and products from the lab to the 
factory to customers’ homes 
and businesses everywhere.
And finally, it’s our brand, 3M 
Science. Applied to Life. ™, that adds value to every one of our 
businesses across all our markets.  
Leveraging these fundamental 
strengths — technology, 
manufacturing, global capabilities, 
and brand — is truly what 
creates the power of 3M.
Leveraging strategic 
partnerships
3M is able to transform diverse 
ideas and creativity into superior 
technologies, business assets, and 
innovative product platforms.
One of many things that makes 
3M a singular company is our 
commitment to collaboration. 
There are no silos here. We 
collaborate with each other. Across 
businesses. Across technologies. 
Across oceans and continents.
Case in point: the 3M Tech 
Forum, a self-directed and self-
organized catalyst for the 10,000-
plus people in 3M’s technical 
community. Begun more than 60 
years ago, the Tech Forum gives 
3M researchers the opportunity 
to compare notes with global 
colleagues, collaborate around 
the company’s 46 technology  
platforms , and develop new ideas that fuel the 3M innovation 
pipeline. The collaborating takes 
place at an annual global event, 
spring symposiums, recognition 
programs, and many chapter 
events held throughout the 
year. Included among our Tech 
Forum chapters are the Global 
Product Stewardship, Green 
Chemistry, and Climate chapters.
Additional information on open 
innovation at 3M can be found 
in our customer section .
Discovering what 
the world thinks of 
science
At 3M, science is important to 
us. It’s what fuels our Vision: 
technology improving every 
company, products enhancing every 
home, and innovation improving 
every life. But we also believe it’s 
important to understand what 
the world thinks of science — if 
people outside our organization are 
unaware of it, if they are indifferent 
to its presence around them, or 
if they see, feel, and appreciate

find the answers elsewhere, we 
conducted our own research in

A process that’s built 
for innovation
The strength and uniqueness of 3M 
is our ability to combine and evolve 
multiple technologies from our 46  
platforms  to serve the very different 
and changing needs of our markets. 
Our scientists around the world 
share and combine these 
technologies across all our 
businesses to invent and 
manufacture cutting-edge 
products. These technology 
platforms are owned by the 
company. Development teams 
within each of our businesses and 
corporate research laboratories 
draw from these technologies 
to develop unique solutions for 
their customers and markets.
New-to-the-world processes 
are developed primarily in 
3M’s Corporate R&D Process 
Laboratory, and the development 
of these new processes are 
captured in our New Technology 
Introduction (NTI) framework:•  Explore: Identify the 
market opportunity
•  Qualify: Identify superior product 
concepts to meet customer needs
•  Deploy: Develop the 
technical solution
Meanwhile, our New Product 
Introduction (NPI) process 
provides the robust framework 
for developing products 
from idea to launch.
Together, 3M’s NTI and NPI 
processes provide a common 
framework for technology and 
product commercialization for all 
global business. Information is 
required at every step, or gate, in 
the process, along with deliverable 
tasks. Having consistent practices 
throughout the company for 
technology and product creation 
assists in risk analysis by providing 
a common language from which 
to share tools and best practices 
and manage project portfolios.3M’s fundamental

What we create Innovation management
our corporate Management of 
Change (MOC) process. We 
leverage these LCM processes 
to continuously improve the EHS 
performance of our products. 
A product 
stewardship 
framework that 
continues to advance 
Responsibility for product 
stewardship at 3M is shared across 
a broad spectrum of functions 
positioned within businesses, 
regions, and corporate staff groups. 
Together, individuals across this 
spectrum work to support 3M’s 
core value of respect for our social 
and physical environment.
Product responsibility liaisons 
(PRLs), or product stewards, 
embedded within 3M businesses 
and countries of operation, act 
as champions of product EHS, regulatory compliance, and 
Sustainability. They help assure 
our products meet or exceed 
requirements stemming from 3M 
policies, governmental regulations, 
and from our customers.
Our framework for product 
stewardship provides structure 
and consistency for overseeing 
daily activities in a proactive, not 
reactive, mode. We have a long-
existing process for tracking 
potential and near-miss incidents 
and a self-auditing program to 
identify leading indicators instead 
of waiting until non-compliance.
3M has been on the leading edge 
of product stewardship audits, 
beginning with self-assessments 
in international regions in 
2007, and incorporating global 
on-site audits in 2014. These 
audits evaluate, among other 
elements, product hazard and risk 
assessment, chemical control, life 
cycle management, and consumer 
product safety. The goal of these 
audits is to assure that regions 
and business groups are meeting 
corporate standards, and to 
share best practices globally.
In May of 2018, over 150 3M 
product stewardship professionals 
from across the globe came together for a week-long 
product stewardship conference 
with workshops, customer 
presentations, external speakers, 
executive panels, and training. 
The main objectives included:
•  Advancing “customer first” objectives 
and processes within the global 
product stewardship organization
•  Informing the redesign of the LCM 
process and systems to improve 
customer response, standardize 
processes, and gain productivity
•  Sharing solutions from country to 
country for addressing product 
stewardship challenge areas 
•  Raising global competency 
levels through training and 
workshops, with a focus on LCM 
and regulatory advocacy
•  Advancing the role of product 
stewardship in Sustainability  
3M values the continued 
professional development of its 
product stewardship professionals. 
In addition to conducting the Global 
Product Stewardship Conference 
and supporting attendance at a 
wide variety of external classes 
and conferences, we offer an 
internal education program covering regulatory, policies and 
standards, toxicology, systems 
and business processes, and 
orientation to product responsibility. 
In 2018, the Corporate Product 
Stewardship Department offered 21 
live programs and 46 on-demand 
sessions to the product stewardship 
network. The corporation also 
sponsors a 700-page website 
dedicated to product stewardship 
and global regulatory requirements, 
and we publish a monthly global 
newsletter to keep the network 
informed of recent and upcoming 
regulatory and program changes.
Life cycle 
assessments (LCA ), 
where relevant and 
feasible
In addition to the LCM program, 
which applies to all 3M 
products, we also complete 
ISO 14040-compliant LCAs for 
select 3M products. At 3M, we 
primarily complete cradle-to-
gate LCAs, since the majority 
of our products have use and 
disposal life cycle stages that are 
difficult to characterize. We also 
complete cradle-to-gate LCAs for 
a number of internally produced 
chemicals that are used in the 
manufacturing of 3M products. While it is not possible to complete 
full LCAs for all 55,000-plus 
unique 3M products, evaluation 
of these intermediates allows us 
to better understand the potential 
environmental impacts of key 
components and processes.
In 2018, 3M LCA teams in the U.S. 
and Europe renewed their process 
certifications from The International 
EPD® System to demonstrate 
that appropriate procedures are 
in place to produce scientifically 
sound, technically defensible LCAs 
and EPDs (Environmental Product 
Declarations). Rather than conduct 
independent third-party reviews 
for each individual product LCA 
or EPD, the teams will continue to 
undergo an annual recertification 
process that evaluates conformance 
of the underlying management 
system with the program rules 
and ISO standards. This global 
certification of the LCA process for 
multiple parts of our organization 
is thought to be the first of its kind. 
For our customer greenhouse gas 
reduction (GHG) 2025 goal, we 
realize we can make far greater 
contributions by helping our 
customers reduce their GHG 
emissions through use of our 
products. To calculate these 
emission reductions, our process Product innovation 
that takes the  
long view
3M works to produce products 
with superior environmental 
performance across their entire 
life cycle. We also work with our 
suppliers and business partners 
so that their operations support 
these same objectives. These 
efforts together help define, 
protect, and assure the long-
term success of our company.
Life cycle management (LCM) is 
3M’s approach to assuring that 
EHS and associated regulatory 
considerations are integrated 
into the development and 
commercialization of 3M products 
through 3M’s NPI process. During 
NPI, our business teams provide 
LCM deliverables. These include, 
at a minimum, raw material 
composition; assessments in 
human health and environmental 
toxicology, electrical and 
mechanical safety, and other 
disciplines, as appropriate; 
conformance to regulatory and 
customer EHS requirements; and 
hazard communication documents.

is based on life cycle thinking 
and the ISO 14064-2 standard 
for comparing emissions from the

efforts can be found in the climate  
and energy section  of this report.
Life cycle approach in 
packaging design
In 2018, we continued our long-
standing commitment to efficient 
packaging design. Over the last five 
years, globally, we have reduced 
designed packaging weight by 
more than 13,700 metric tons.  
Support for better packaging 
solutions starts early at 3M via 
engagement with our NPI and 
LCM processes. In an effort to help 
3M employees design packaging 
using a life cycle approach, a 
new model was deployed in 
2018. Over 120 packaging 
designs were evaluated using a 
streamlined LCA. Three separate 
projects alone — returnable 
packaging, reusable packaging, 
and lighter-weight pallets — will 
reduce an estimated 7,700 metric 
tons of CO₂, reinforcing our 
commitment to climate health.
An important part of our packaging 
Sustainability roadmap is internal We will finalize our packaging 
Sustainability roadmap, firmly built 
within the “Science for Circular” 
aspiration, and progressively 
roll out prioritized targets. Our 
roadmap will necessitate further 
collaboration with key suppliers 
and internal stakeholders to identify 
and explore sustainable packaging 
opportunities and technologies, 
including migration from fossil-fuel-
based plastic feedstocks toward 
renewable plastic feedstock, and 
to increase the recycled content 
of our packaging materials.In 2019, 3M will launch a new 
website within 3M.com to 
provide customers with complete 
ingredient information for over 600 
consumer-formulated products. The 
website will include information 
on ingredient purpose and, if 
applicable, ingredient inclusion 
on chemical-of-concern lists. 
We have a process that provides 
the robust framework for 
developing products from idea 
to launch. Starting in 2018, and 
continuing deployment through 
2019, we are building on our 
existing framework for new 
product introduction through a 
new system called 3M|Grow. As 
part of this new framework, we’re 
updating task and deliverables

Our actions
In 2018, we delivered organic 
growth of more than three percent 
with growth across all business 
groups and geographic areas.  
We also delivered record sales of 
$32.8 billion.Our 
commitment
At 3M, we bring all of our product 
solutions to different markets 
through our five business groups — 
sharing technology, manufacturing, 
marketing, and other resources to 
increase our speed and efficiency.
What’s more, as of December 5, 
2018, every 3M business group 
shares another powerful bond.  
On that day, at the National 
Climate Change Conference 
(COP24), we announced that 
100 percent of our new products 
will be required to have a 
Sustainability Value  Commitment  
demonstrating how they drives 
impact for the greater good. 
This formal requirement, which 
goes into effect in 2019, is 
significant because it embeds 
Sustainability into the pipeline 
that produces 3M's diverse global products. A significant 
fraction of the company’s annual 
sales come from products 
created in the past five years. 
Examples of a Sustainability Value 
Commitment in new 3M products 
include recyclability, energy 
and water savings, responsible 
sourcing, renewable materials, and 
appropriate reuse of a product. Also 
included will be products whose 
core purpose is helping to solve 
an environmental and/or social 
problem. For example: improving 
air quality, reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions, improving patients 
outcomes, and enhancing worker 
safety in industrial settings.
3M’s new product requirement 
will have a global impact, starting 
in the 70 countries where we 
operate and in the products we 
sell in nearly every country. It will 
also help our customers reach their own Sustainability goals. 
Most important, it impacts 3M 
employees. When you work for 
3M, you are changing the world.
It’s another important step 
forward in our ambition to apply 
science to improve every life,

The data provided in this report 
through facts and figures is based 
on activities during 3M’s fiscal 
year 2018. For some performance 
indicators, the previous year’s 
data are provided to allow 
for annual comparisons.
Report data collection
Due to the size and geographical 
extent of our operations, it is 
at times difficult to obtain all 
data points. Therefore, to the 
extent possible, limitations 
and assumptions are stated as 
information in the report. This 
report's data has been reviewed 
for accuracy and completeness, 
including the reliability of the 
systems used to obtain the data.
Unless noted below, corporate 
staff have also verified the 
implementation of policies and 
management systems through 
audits and self-reporting systems.•  Financial data:  Financial information 
referenced in this report is collected 
and reported in accordance with 
the United States Securities and 
Exchange Commission through 
the Annual Report 2018
•  Environmental, health, and safety 
(EHS) data: The EHS data in this 
report is related to environment, 
safety performance, management 
systems, implementation, and

collection systems are in place 
at applicable sites to track and 
collect environmental, health and 
safety data through corporate-
wide EHS reporting systems 
(e.g., Environmental Targets 
Database, Worldwide Incident 
Management System, etc.)
•  Social data: The data related 
to employee metrics, metrics,

Sites acquired by 3M are integrated 
into 3M programs and reporting 
systems via a prioritized functional 
integration schedule. Timeframe 
for integration varies depending 
on subject-matter reporting 
requirements and site systems 
before being acquired; however, 
on average, integration ranges 
between one and three years.

document any changes to 
financial data. Several of 3M’s 
environmental goals are normalized 
per net sales. 3M does not 
adjust sales data for inflation.
3M generally does not adjust its 
base-year environmental metrics 
data to reflect changes in 3M’s

production (tons emitted or net 
sales) to assure the environmental 
progress we report to the public is 
not unduly influenced by changes  
to our organizational structure. 
However, in the case of our 
greenhouse gas emissions data, 
3M follows the World Resource 
Institute (WRI) and World 
Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD) GHG 
Protocol. Consequently, we readjust 
our greenhouse gas emissions base-
year data in the case of business 
acquisitions and divestitures.
Whenever feasible, 3M adjusts 
base-year and other years’ data if 
data collection methods change 
or data errors are identified. 
Any significant changes in the 
measurement methods and/or  
data values applied to key 
environmental metrics from 
previous years are disclosed in 
the report. Significant changes 
are defined by this Sustainability 
Report as changes greater than 5 
percent of the original data point.
Between 2005 and 2010, 3M 
adopted a holistic definition of 
waste to drive the company’s 
waste reduction efforts toward 
more sustainable solutions, such as 
pollution prevention. 3M’s waste 
reduction goal and progress during this period included recycling. 
In 2011, 3M returned to a more 
conventional definition of waste 
that considered recycling as neutral 
(contributing neither toward total 
waste nor toward good output).
3M’s 2025 Sustainability Goals 
utilize 2015 as the base year. 
Starting with this program, waste  
disposed and waste by disposal 
type do not include waste-to-
energy. Total hazardous and  
total non-hazardous include 
waste-to-energy.
For this year’s report, we identified 
an opportunity in last year’s (2017 
reporting year) process used to 
identify manufacturing facilities 
for a portion of our greenhouse 
gas emissions (GHG). In 2018, 
and moving forward, facility 
classification will better align to 
our 2002 inventory. This change 
impacted calculation methodologies 
for energy and waste GHG 
estimations. Therefore, limiting 
direct comparability of Scope 
1, 2, and Scope 3 category 5 
between reporting year 2017 and 
2018. For this reason, reporting 
years 2017 and 2018 Scope 1 and 
2 GHG emissions year-on-year 
comparison should be viewed 
as an estimate. The 2018 GHG inventory is fully comparable 
with baseline year 2002.
In addition, we identified an input 
change for our Scope 3 category 
6, emissions from business travel. 
Input data formerly used was no 
longer available from one of our

emissions, a new input was available 
covering reporting years 2016 to 
2018. This change in methodology

Global Reporting 
Initiative
The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
is a network-based organization 
that includes representatives from business, government, labor, 
third-party advocacy groups, and 
academia. The GRI organization 
has developed a framework 
for Sustainability reporting. 
Following the GRI Sustainability 
framework advances two important 
objectives: transparency and the 
ability to compare results from 
one organization to another. 3M 
has developed this report using 
GRI Standards. The following GRI 
Index outlines where specific GRI 
reporting elements and indicators 
are addressed in the report or other 
reporting sources, including the 
Annual Report 2018, 2019 Notice 
of Annual Meeting & Proxy, and/
or other noted sources on 3M’s 
Investor Relations website.
Our material aspects are identified 
in the GRI Index  and reflected 
in our 2025 goals, with focus 
on raw materials, water, climate 
and energy, health and safety, 
and education and development. 
3M self-declares this report, has 
been prepared in accordance 
with the GRI Standards:

Compact (UNGC) 
Communication on 
Progress (COP)
The UNGC is a strategic policy 
initiative for businesses that 
are committed to aligning their 
operations and strategies with 10 
universally accepted principles 
in the areas of human rights, 
labor, environment, and anti-
corruption. 3M committed to the 
UNGC principles in early 2014. 
This report includes an index of 
our COP implementing the 10 
principles as well as alignment 
with the United Nations 2030 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) within the content of this 
2019 Sustainability Report.

Board (SASB)
For our Sustainability reporting 
strategy, we utilize multiple tools 
and frameworks to assure we 
are objective, transparent, and 
globally relevant in our public 
reporting process. This includes

About reportReport scope and boundaries
With corporate operations in 70 
countries and sales in nearly all 
countries, our strategy is designed 
to be holistic. GRI was selected as 
the primary source referenced due 
to the global reach of the standard. 
For SASB, our diversity of 
operations would not be 
represented by their current  
industry standard classifications ; 
3M is grouped as a primary SISC 
Sector: Resource Transformation, 
primary SICS Industry: Containers 
& Packaging. Using 46 technology 
platforms, our integrated team 
of scientists and researchers 
works with customers to create 
breakthroughs via our Consumer, 
Electronics & Energy, Industrial, 
Health Care, and Safety & 
Graphics business groups.  
In this year’s report, we detail our 
efforts on our 2018 materiality 
assessment.  Before conducting 
this assessment, we reviewed 
and integrated SASB’s approach 
to materiality and materiality 
map to help prioritize the most 
important focus areas.UNGC Principles and 
2030 SDGs

For additional details on SASB integration for this report, see the about report section .  INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT 
Introduction and objectives of work  
Bureau Veritas North America, Inc. (Bureau Veritas) was engaged by 3M Corporation (3M) to 
conduct an independent assurance of its 2019 3M Sustainability Report (the Report). This 
Assurance Statement applies to the related information included within the scope of work 
described below and within the boundaries specified in the Report. The intended users of the 
assurance statement are the stakeholders of 3M. The overall aim of this process is to provide 
assurance to 3Mʼs stakeholders on the accuracy, reliability and objectivity of the information 
included in the Report as described in the scope of work. The assurance process also evaluated 
3Mʼs management of sustainability in accordance with the principles of inclusivity, materiality 
and responsiveness. 
The information that was assured and its presentation in the Report are the sole responsibility 
of the management of 3M.  Bureau Veritas was no t involved in the drafting of the Report. Our 
sole responsibility was to provide independent assurance on its content.  
Scope of work
3M requested Bureau Veritas to include in its independent assurance the following:  
 Data included in the Report for the calendar year 2018 reporting period as shown in 
the attached Summary of Assured Information;  
 Appropriateness and robustness of underlying reporting systems and processes, used 
to collect, analyze and review the data subject to the assurance process; and 
 Evaluation of the Report in accordance with the Assurance Standard AA1000AS 
(2008)1 Type 2 assurance. 
Excluded from the scope of our work is any assurance of information relating to: 
 Text or other written statements associated with the Report; 
 Activities outside the defined assurance period; and  
 Financial data and data reported that are not included in the Summary of Assured 
Information. 
Methodology  
Bureau Veritas undertook the following activities during the assurance process:  
1. Interviews with relevant personnel of 3M (including managers and staff members at 
the corporate and site level);  
2. Review of internal and external documentary evidence produced by 3M;  
3. Audit of performance data presented in the Report including a detailed review of a 
sample of data; 
4. Visits to manufacturing sites located in Cordova, IL; Cynthiana, KY; and Knoxville, IA; 
5. Remote data reviews for manufacturing sites located in Brockville, ON, Canada; 
Shanghai, China; and Wroclaw, Poland; 
6. Visit to 3M headquarters office located in Maplewood, Minnesota; and

About reportAssurance statement
Assurance 
statementAbout reportPlants in water stressed areas have developed water plans and 3M is working to continue 
to improve the plans through standardization and working with regional groups. 
With corporate staff support, plants are developing project plans that have quantified 
expected results to meet overall reduction goals with respect to waste and water.  This 
provides additional support to the planning for achieving goals. 
3M continued to work within their supply chain, specifically with paper providers, to engage 
higher Tier suppliers to ensure sustainable practices are being followed. 
Control of emissions of high global warming potential compounds from manufacturing 
processes is continuing to evolve to reduce process-related GHG emissions.   
Community giving is aligned with core organizational values to improve lives with a focus on 
education, community and the environment, specifically supporting underserved and under 
resourced populations. 3M provides community support through various engagements in 
the community.  Corporately, the 3M Foundation provides funding to targeted non-profit 
organizations in the U.S. and within their global footprint.  3M also makes in-kind donations. 
Statement of independence, impartiality and competence 
Bureau Veritas is an independent professional services company that specializes in Quality, 
Health, Safety, Social and Environmental management with over 180 years history in providing 
independent assurance services, and an annual 2018 revenue of 4.8 Billion Euros. 
No member of the assurance team has a business relationship with 3M, its Directors or 
Managers beyond that of verification and assu rance of sustainability data and reporting. We 
have conducted this verification independently and we believe there to have been no conflict 
of interest.  Bureau Veritas has implemented  a Code of Ethics across the business to 
maintain high ethical standards among staff in their day-to-day business activities.   
The assurance team has extensive experience in conducting assurance over environmental, 
social, ethical and health and safety information, systems and processes, has over 20 years 
combined experience in this field and an excellent understanding of Bureau Veritas standard 
methodology for the Assurance of Sustainability Reports.

7. Review of 3M data and information systems for collection, aggregation, analysis and 
internal verification and review.  
The work was planned and carried out to provide a moderate level of assurance and we believe 
it provides a sound basis for our conclusions.  
Our findings
On the basis of our methodology and the activities described above:
 Nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the reviewed information within the 
scope of our verification is not materially correct. 
 Nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the reviewed information is not a fair 
representation of the actual environmental and health and safety data for calendar year 
2018.  
 It is our opinion that 3M has established appropriate systems for the collection, 
aggregation and analysis of quantitative data, including energy use, direct and indirect 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption, waste quantities and 
disposition, injury and illness rate, lost day rate, severity rate and number of 
environmental violations.  
A summary of data within the scope of assurance for 2018 is attached. 
Adherence to the AA1000 Accountability Principles   
Based on the work undertaken during this assura nce process, we are of the opinion that 3M 
adheres to the Accountability Principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness as 
discussed below. 
Inclusivity 
Based on discussions with 3M, their processes appear to be inclusive of stakeholders. In 2018, 
3M commissioned a third party provider to update their materiality assessment and used that 
assessment to identify and engage stakeholders. Some of the stakeholder groups that 3M has 
identified to include in their sustainability processes include 3M employees, customers, non-
governmental organizations, investors and the public. 
Materiality  
3M updated their materiality assessment in 2018. During the materiality assessment 
stakeholders indicated that 3M should take a leadership role.  The Chief Technology Officer 
and Chief Sustainability Officer report annually to the Boardʼs Nominating and Governance 
Committee on their sustainabili ty efforts. In addition, their Corporate EHS and Business 
Conduct Committee ensures that sustainability principles are embedded throughout the 
company.  Background information can be found in the 3M proxy statement: 
https://investors.3m.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-
details/default.aspx?FilingId=13322342 
Responsiveness  
3M receives questions regarding sustainability from customers, investors, non-governmental 
organizations and others through various channels. The company has guidance for responding 
to customer inquiries on sustainability issues and uses this guidance for responding to other 
groups as well. Responses to surveys are coordi nated by the corporate sustainability group. 
Each business group also has sustainability lead s who assist with responding to stakeholders.  
In addition, through the materiality assessment, 3M is building out a strategy for future 
sustainability efforts. 
Key Observations for 2018 
Data systems at 3M allow for consolidation and review of environmental, safety, and 
energy data at the corporate level for reporting.  Internal auditing assists with ensuring 
accurate data collection.
