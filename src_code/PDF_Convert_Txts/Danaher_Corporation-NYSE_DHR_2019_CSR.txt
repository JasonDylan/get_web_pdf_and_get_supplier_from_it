Welcome to Danaher's 2019 Sustainability Report. This year marks Danaher's 35th 
anniversary, and my 30th year with the company. We've come a long way since Steven and 
Mitchell Rales first envisioned a purpose-driven, customer-centric company as they fished 
the waters of the Danaher River in western Montana. 
Over these decades, Danaher has grown and changed 
substantially, along with the evolving markets we serve. 
Today we are a global science and technology innovator 
committed to solving the world's most complex 
challenges. Danaher's businesses are developing 
advanced diagnostic tools, driving life-saving scientific 
research and helping ensure the safety of global food and 
water 
supplies. Our diverse team of associates and 
operating companies-each with distinct missions and 
challenges-converges around Our Shared Purpose , 
Helping Realize Life's Potential, to make a difference in the 
world. 
As I consider how far we've come since 1984, I think about 
the role we want to play in the years ahead. In our last 
report, we introduced our sustainability philosophy and 
framework, which is structured around three 
pillars-innovation, people and environment. This report 
marks our shift to an annual reporting cadence, a 
reflection of our commitment to achieving measurable 
results in each area. I'm proud to share our team's 
progress to date and our future 
plans in the pages that 
follow. 
Pictured: Thomas P. Joyce, Jr., President & CEO INNOVATION 
At the heart of our sustainability efforts is Innovation 
with purpose. In the spirit of our Core Value, Innovation 
Defines Our Future, our teams work to expand access to 
healthcare in underserved areas, improve safety and 
protect precious natural resources. Investing in 
innovation is one of the ways we build businesses , and we 
spent over $1.2 billion on research and development in 
2018. 
This investment yields breakthroughs that benefit people 
and communities worldwide. TrojanUV's wastewater 
treatment systems save 1.5 billion gal Ions of water for 
reuse each day. And Beckman Coulter's DxH 900 with 
Early Sepsis Indicator helps physicians identify one of the 
body's most life-threatening responses to infection. Our 
company-wide commitment to research and development 
resulted in more than 750 new patents in 2018, impacting 
countless lives around the world. 
FROM OUR CEO 03 FROM OUR CEO 
"With each step forward, each decision made and each new 
milestone met, we strengthen our business, our culture, and our 
pursuit of Our Shared Purpose: Helping Realize Life1s Potential:' 
PEOPLE 
Our People pillar focuses on our most valuable 
resource-and flows from our Core Value, The Best Team 
Wins. We strongly believe that the best team is a diverse 
team that reflects the global community we serve. I am 
excited to share that Danaher was featured on the Forbes 
2019 Best Employers for Diversity list and recognized as 
one of the Human Rights Campaign's Best Places to Work 
for LGBTQ Equality for the sixth year in a row. 
I am also proud of our continued human capital 
investments focused on acquiring, developing, engaging 
and retaining the talent we need to support our business, 
today and in the years to come. 
Danaher Sustainability Report 2019 ENVIRONMENT 
Our Environment pillar considers the broader impact of 
our products and operations, from reducing energy use to 
producing technology that protects the earth's resources. 
A number of our businesses directly protect our global 
water supply by monitoring the health of our oceans, 
treating industrial water and purifying drinking water. 
In last year's report, we committed to publishing metrics 
to quantify our environmental impact, which you w ill find 
in this report. I am also pleased to share that we are 
applying the streamlined processes of our proven 
Danaher Business System (DBS) to sustainability to help 
mitigate our environmental impact in key areas. You'll 
read more about our Energy Management Toolkit, as well 
as our efforts to choose sustainable materials that 
minimize our footprint, in the pages to follow. As I reflect on our past and look to our future, I believe we 
are poised to continue strengthening our bus iness, our 
culture and our pursuit of Helping Realize Life's Potential. 
We will advance th is purpose by welcoming a breadth o f 
perspectives as we look to the important wo rk still to be 
done, the new chal lenges around the bend , the 
world-shaping innovations yet to come. 
Thank you, as always , for your support.

Danaher Sustainability Report 2019 COMPENSATION 
We are committed to offering competitive total rewards, 
tailored to geography, industry and experience. Danaher's 
compensation programs and practices are designed to 
attract associates, motivate and reward performance, 
drive growth and support retention. In general, 
compensation at Danaher includes base salary and often 
some form of variable bonus or incentive opportunity. In 
addition, selected associates receive long-term 
compensation in the form of Danaher equity awards. 
HOW WE COMPENSATE EXECUTIVES 
The goal of our executive compensation program is to 
build value for our shareholders. The program is designed 
to reward executive officers who build long-term 
shareholder value, achieve annual business goals and 
maintain long-term careers with Danaher. Our program's 
emphasis on 
long-term equity awards, tied closely to 
shareholder returns and subject to significant vesting and 
holding periods, has been fundamental in attracting 
skilled executives, encouraging them to build long-term 
careers with Danaher, and motivating them to achieve 
sustainable operating and financial performance through 
a range of economic cycles. We provide our shareholders 
an opportunity to cast an annual advisory vote with 
respect to the compensation of our named executive 
officers, as disclosed in our annual proxy statement (the 
"say on pay proposal"). At Danaher's annual meeting of 
shareholders in May 2019, 97% of the votes cast were in 
favor of the say-on-pay proposal. The Danaher Scholarship Progr am helps reduce the 
financial burden of higher education costs for Danaher families. In 2019, we helped fund the academic pursuits of 75 of our associates’ children at colleges and univ ersities around the globe. The recipients—22 new scholars and 53 renewal scholars—were selected on the basis of academic record, demonstr ated leadership, participation in school and community activities, honors, work e xperience, and a statement of goals and aspir ations. Since its inception, the Danaher Scholarship Progr am has pro vided more than $3 million in scholarship a wards to support the de v elopment, growth and potential of our associates’ children as the y seek higher education.
In 2018, Danaher began offering paid parental lea v e for 
its U .S. associates. New parents in the U .S. (including U .S. e xpatriates) are eligible to tak e up to eight weeks of 100% paid lea v e within the first y ear of a child’s birth, adoption or foster care placement.

PERSONAL POTENTIAL 
VOLUNTEER TIME OFF 
Our associates are helpers in and out of the workplace. They know that time spent in the 
service of others provides the perspective, gratitude, focus and inspiration that makes 
them happier and more productive at work and home. Danaher operating companies, 
including Beckman Coulter, Cepheid, Eska and IDT, support their associates' commitment 
to volunteerism with team volunteer days and volunteer time off. 
CEPHEID'S BACKPACKS FOR POTENTIAL 
Cepheid launched its volunteer time off program in the 
U.S. in 2019. Eligible associates can volunteer individually 
or gather a group of like-minded colleagues to support 
their community. In July 2019, a group of customer care 
associates from Sunnyvale, California stuffed school 
backpacks for under-privileged students. Within three 
months of launch, Cepheid associates had already 
contributed nearly 250 hours of volunteer time to their 
local communities. 
Danaher Sustainability Report 2019COMMUNITY SUPPORT FROM ESKO 
Esko North America provides full-and part-time 
associates one day of paid volunteer time off annually. In 
2019, associate volunteers banded together to support 
Feed My Starving Children, hand-packing more than 
9,000 meals, which is enough to provide 24 children with 
one meal per day for an entire year. Man y of Danaher’s learning progr ams are facilitated b y 
our own certified instructors, who undergo formal tr ain-the-tr ainer progr ams before receiving certification. As of mid-2019, Danaher had more than 650 certified facilitators co v ering e v ery major region in which we oper ate.F rom individual contributors to managers and senior leaders, we help our associates realize their potential with meaningful career de v elopment opportunities. Our approach includes a mix of on-the-job learning, coaching, and leadership and DBS tr aining. W e call this our 70/20/10 model.

Le ading for Equ ality
Mentoring and coaching progr ams are a vailable as part of 
our Associate Resource Groups’ progr amming. These progr ams help forge connections with and among underrepresented talent and our leaders. The W omen & F riends AR G coaching progr am pro vides an opportunity for Danaher women to access one-on-one coaching with a licensed professional.
According to one woman leader:
Another woman commented:
Diver s e T alent M ent oring
“ Coaching helped me learn quite a bit about m yself and 
how I show up to others, and how I want to show up. Additionally , this has helped me to prioritize and articulate m y own personal and professional goals. I ha v e used the concepts [I learned] to coach m y own team members as well as informally coach and mentor others on a daily basis. This applies to women at all stages of theircareers—recent college gr ads through senior le v els in the organization. ”
“ When I entered the coaching cohort, I was lost in a 
struggle with being a great leader at work and being a great mom and wife at home. My inner critics had me confused and unsure I could be great at either one. The tr ansformation of m y mindset achie v ed through coaching allowed me to identify what success really look ed lik e for me, and now , I can confidently sa y toda y I am a great mom, wife and leader . Coaching changed m y life. ”Danaher’s suite of leadership de v elopment courses includes targeted D+I tr aining focused on unconscious bias and creating leader accountability . In 2019, Danaher launched Growing Inclusiv e T eams, our global div ersity and inclusion tr aining that teaches associates how to identify and understand the impacts of D+I, and how to recognize and mitigate personal bias. The course is deplo y ed globally and a vailable in 13 languages. 
Consistent with our dedication to continuous 
impro v ement, Danaher intends to disclose div ersity representation metrics in our 2020 Sustainability Report.D+I Tr aining

SAFETY 
Associate safety is deeply embedded in our culture. Our emphasis on workplace safety 
seeks to ensure our associates feel good about coming to work, and that they leave safe 
and healthy at the end of every shift. We are proud that workplace safety consistently 
receives high scores in our annual Associate Engagement Survey. Our safety score 
exceeds the top-quartile benchmark of our survey administrator's global clients and has 
increased every year since our survey began in 2013. 
OUR 4E TOOLKIT 
This DBS-based set of tools enables our associates to identify, assess and control hazards related to the "four Esll: 
ergonomics, energetics, exposures and environment. Over the past four years, we have expanded and 
refined our "4E11 
portfolio of management tools. 
Launched in 2015, this DBS-based 
framework empowers our associates 
with methods to identify, assess and 
control safety risk. 
2015 
-------------
2016 We introduced leading EHS indicators, 
such as near misses and safety 
observations, into our daily 
management process. The use of 
leading indicators, self-audits and 
kamishibai, reduce the level of hazard 
in our workplaces. 
2017 
-------------
2018 Addressing "Environment", the fourth 
"E" in the 4E framework, we developed 
and began implementing a 
comprehensive set of tools for energy 
management focused on reducing 
energy consumption at our major 
facilities through DBS. 
2019 
We introduced layered EHS 
self-audits and the use of kamishibai, 
a DBS visual tool that helps sustain 
operational safety improvements. We added concepts for controlling 
hazards that had the potential for 
serious injuries or fatalities (SIF). 
Danaher Sustainability Report 2019 ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICY 
Our Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy established 
the core principles upon which our EHS management 
programs are built. Our operating companies use DBS to 
integrate EHS requirements into their operations, and to 
sustain their results. 
EHS RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 
We revised our EHS risk assessment process in 2016 to place 
greater emphasis on operational risk control and our use of 
DBS to manage EHS risk. We assess sixteen criteria against 
four levels of performance on a semi-annual basis, assigning an 
EHS risk score to each of our major facilities. The facility-level 
teams set risk reduction targets and maintain action plans to 
improve their scores. 
• Between 2016 and 2018, our operating companies 
reduced Danaher's EHS mean risk score by 25%. 
• Between 2010 and 2018, our operating companies 
reduced Danaher's workplace incident and injury rates 
by over 60%. 
PROTECTING OUR ASSOCIATES 
Each of our operating companies has developed processes to 
protect our associates and facilities from fire and natural 
hazards, and assure business continuity. We continually invest 
to further safeguard our facilities. Our emphasis on improving 
crisis 
management and business continuity plans helps ensure 
the wellbeing of our associates during extreme weather events 
and other emergencies. 
• Our Pall plant in Fajardo, Puerto Rico manufactures 
bioprocessing solutions used to make life-saving drugs. To 
continue meeting 
critical demand when faced with 
electric grid instability during hurricane season, the plant 
is slated to bring a combined heat and power plant online 
in December 2019. This installation is expected to reduce 
energy consumption sourced from the grid by 50%.

In 2018, we deplo y ed our 
first DBS en vironmental sustain ability tools, which focus on reducing energy use and waste.The DBS Energy Management T oolkit guides our 
facility-le v el teams in identifying, prioritizing and implementing measures that impro v e energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Our teams use the toolkit to establish a thorough 
understanding of our energy consumption and identify areas for impro v ement in the form of an Opportunity Assessment. Ne xt, the teams de v elop energy management action plans based on the following fr amework, and implement those plans using a variety of DBS tools:

For over two decades, Danaher has worked to safeguard our global water supply through 
our Water Quality businesses. Each day, our passionate teams of water experts dedicate 
themselves to providing environmental, industrial and municipal customers with the 
advanced products and services they need to efficiently monitor and protect our water 
resources. 
TROJANUV HELPS RESTORE GROUNDWATER LEVELS 
TrojanUV is helping industrial and municipal customers 
reuse and recycle water to achieve a sustainable water 
supply. Groundwater pumping in California over the last 
century has caused groundwater levels to drop, allowing 
seawater to intrude into the local groundwater aquifer. 
Innovations like TrojanUVSigna and TrojanUVPhox have 
helped customers rebuild the groundwater barrier, 
limiting the salt content in groundwater for much of 
Southern California's coastline communities and farmers. 
MONITORING THE HEALTH OF OUR OCEANS 
Sea-Bird Scientific develops innovative instruments that 
measure the condition and health of our world's oceans. 
As our oceans become more acidic due to rising carbon 
dioxide levels associated with climate change, Sea-Bird 
has worked with customers to develop a unique solution 
to measure changes in acidity within the oceanic layers 
over long time periods. These sensors are deployed on 
over 200 autonomous vehicles dispersed throughout the 
Southern (Antarctic) Ocean and collect near real-time 
data. The data collected is being used by scientists to 
understand the influence of a rapidly acidifying ocean on 
marine life, coral reef health and the climate, informing 
conservation and resource management policy efforts.

The foundation of our Board’s CEO succession planning process is a CEO de v elopment model consisting of two dimensions: leadership beha viors and de v elopment e xperiences. The Board uses the de v elopment model as a guide in preparing candidates, and also in e valuating candidates for the CEO and other e x ecutiv e positions at the Board’s annual talent re view and succession planning session. At the annual session, the Board e valuates and compares candidates using the de v elopment model, and re views each candidate ’s de v elopment actions and progress o v er time, as well as business performance. The candidate e valuations are supplemented with periodic 360-degree performance appr aisals, and the Board also regularly inter acts with candidates at Board dinners and lunches, through Board meeting presentations and at the compan y’s annual leadership conference.

T o mitigate the risks posed b y cybersecurity incidents and 
cyber-attacks in particular , we ha v e de v eloped a progr am, led b y the Compan y’s Chief Information Security Officer , designed to protect the confidentiality , integrity and continued a vailability of the Compan y’s data and systems. This progr am includes a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan and other policies and procedures designed to assist the Compan y in managing cybersecurity incidents and risks. Danaher’s Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer pro vide regular updates to the Audit Committee regarding this progr am, including information about cyber risk management go v ernance and the status of projects to strengthen cybersecurity controls. The Audit Committee regularly briefs the full Board on these matters, and the full Board also receiv es periodic briefings from management on the Compan y’s cybersecurity progr am. The Compan y has also updated its disclosure controls and procedures to specifically address cybersecurity risk, including b y amending the Compan y’s Insider T r ading P olicy to address cybersecurity and b y ensuring clear linkage between Danaher’s Disclosure Committee and Chief Information Security Officer .
The Nominating and Go v ernance Committee re views and, 
if appropriate, appro v es all related person tr ansactions ( defined as tr ansactions required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the U .S. Securities Ex change Act of 1934, as amended), prior to consummation whene v er pr acticable. Related person tr ansactions of an ongoing nature are re viewed annually b y the Committee.While risk-taking is essential to growing a business, we recognize that prudent risk management is necessary to deliv er long-term, sustainable shareholder value. The goal of our Enterprise Risk Management progr am is to comprehensiv ely in v entory and mitigate k e y risks across all of Danaher’s platforms and oper ating companies.  Danaher e valuates risks across fiv e main pillars: oper ational, str ategic, financial and accounting, compliance and information technology / security .  The risk data collected is used to support effectiv e business decision-making and assess risk-reward tr adeoffs.  It also giv es our leadership visibility into k e y risks and countermeasures and enables us to mitigate risks as dictated b y our risk-reward assessment.  The result is that Danaher and its oper ating companies are able to build better , more resilient businesses supported b y a risk-based approach.  
The Board’s role in risk o v ersight is consistent with 
Danaher’s leadership structure: management has da y-to-da y responsibility for assessing and managing Danaher’s risk e xposure and the Board and its committees o v ersee those efforts, with emphasis on our most significant risks. Annually , our senior management reports on our risk management process to the Audit Committee and on the results of that process to our Board of Directors. The strength of our risk management progr am lies in the autonom y we giv e our oper ating companies to think broadly about the risks the y face and determine how best to mitigate them.
