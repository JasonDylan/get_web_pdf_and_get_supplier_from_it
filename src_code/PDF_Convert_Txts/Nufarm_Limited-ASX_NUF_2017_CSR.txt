This report, prepared by Nufarm 
Limited, provides information relating to our sustainability practices and 
performance for the financial year 
ending 31 July 2017, (referred to  in this report as 2017). This reporting period aligns with our financial 
reporting. Details of our annual  
and half yearly financial performance  
can be found in our financial reports,  which are available on our website: nufarm.com, as is our 2016 
sustainability report.
Our annual sustainability report 
addresses a range of parameters  and activities including health, safety, environment, our people, corporate 
governance practices and community 
relations, and covers Nufarm’s significant locations and operations. 
This report covers all Nufarm’s 
businesses including wholly-owned subsidiaries. The health and safety data includes permanent and 
non-permanent employees as 
well as contractors across Nufarm manufacturing sites, offices and regional service centres. 
Environmental data is provided  
by our manufacturing plants and summarised for this report. As of  yet, it does not include environmental 
data from Nuseed, our sales offices  
or distribution centres; however,  these represent a small percentage  of our environmental footprint. 
Nufarm finalised its manufacturing 
rationalisation during 2016. Historical data in this report includes former Nufarm operations – 2017 data reflects 
Nufarm’s new manufacturing footprint.Last year we began working towards 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, and this report meets  
many of the core standards and  
some of the specific disclosures as  
per the GRI content index. This year we completed a preliminary materiality 
study to identify the key material  
topics we will report on from this year.
This report has been reviewed and 
approved by Nufarm’s CEO and managing director Greg Hunt.

NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
04A diverse team of Nufarm employees 
developed our mission, value and  vision as a part of our ReNu program  
in 2012. After approval by our executive leadership team these have been communicated broadly internally and externally, guiding our strategy, 
our activities and our behaviours.
Nufarm has a code of conduct that has 
been approved by Nufarm’s board of directors to guide employees’ decision 
making and behaviour. New employees 
are inducted into our code of conduct when they join the organisation. 
It’s Nufarm’s objective to carry out  
its business with no adverse effect  
on its people, the community and  
the environment and to strive for 
sustainable development and continual 
improvement. Our health, safety and 
environment (HSE) policy is available  in the sustainability section of our corporate website.
A strategic response to global 
challenges
The global population is expected  
to exceed nine billion people by 2050, significantly increasing the demand for 
food. In 2016 Nufarm implemented a 
new business strategy with a focus on five key crop segments: corn; soybeans; cereals; pasture, turf and ornamental; 
and trees, nuts, vines and vegetables, 
and four core regions: Australia and New Zealand; Latin America; North America; and Europe. By targeting these crops, we are aligning our 
expertise in sustainably improving  
crop efficiency with key food production regions of the world.
Global fish stocks are being rapidly 
depleted and in support of sustainable fisheries we developed omega 3 canola, the first land-based source  of omega 3. Regulatory authorities  
in Australia, the US and Canada  
are currently assessing approval submissions and the company isharvesting its first pre-commercial large 
scale crop in Washington State, USA, 
with plans for a commercial launch in Nufarm’s 2018/19 financial year. 
Water stress impacts most growers 
from time to time and our wholly-
owned subsidiary, Nuseed, has a strategy to develop top-performing seeds, including drought and  
salt-resistant varieties.
In 2017, we have continued to invest  
in our supply chain capability and business systems that will enable  us to better serve our customers.In Australia and New Zealand,  
we announced the merger of the Cropcare and Nufarm businesses  
into one effective business as of  
2018. We completed changes to  
our manufacturing footprint in 2016  
and continue to make improvements 
through our manufacturing  
efficiencies program.
Financial and economic 
performance
Our financial results are released 
annually and reflect the period  1 August to 31 July. We also release 
our half yearly results for the period  
1 August to 31 January. These reports are on our website and list all entities included in Nufarm’s consolidated 
results. A number of entities are 
included in these statements that  are not covered by the environmental data in these reports; however, it is estimated that this report addresses  
90 per cent of Nufarm’s environmental 
footprint. Table 1 provides a summary of our financial results.

Our impact on, and contribution  
to the economy is as important  
as our financial performance. Our 
contribution includes both direct and indirect employment, support of farming practices to improve efficiency and productivity, the support of local 
suppliers, capital investment programs, 
payment of taxes and contribution  to local communities. Our supply chain
Nufarm has 13 crop protection manufacturing facilities located in Europe, North America, Latin America, 
Asia and Australia enabling us to tailor 
our products to suit local conditions and respond rapidly to customer needs. 
Supplier location is just one of many 
considerations evaluated when sourcing the raw materials and packaging needed by our manufacturing plants. We have significant suppliers located throughout 
Europe, Asia, North America, Brazil  
and Australia and more than 3,000 suppliers across the world to support our global supply chain network. 
Nufarm’s procurement organisation is 
led out of our head office in Australia and through procurement hubs in China, Malaysia and Switzerland.
We primarily sell our crop protection 
and seed products direct to channel partners, who are distributors that sell 
directly to growers and offer other 
agricultural inputs and advice. Sustainability at Nufarm
Sustainability underpins our approach to doing business. Responsibility is  one of our core values and we believe 
that acting responsibly generates 
long-term value for our stakeholders. Our sustainability strategy has six pillars: safety; environment; our people;  
ethical sourcing; product stewardship; and our community responsibilities.
Nufarm works in an industry  
where sustainability principles are 
entrenched. As a company engaged  
in the development, production and supply of inputs to agriculture, we see sustainability as an overarching business 
principle that generates value by 
delivering solutions to farmers and providing environmental benefits.
The organisation is now two years  
into deployment of its four-year 
sustainability strategy. Execution  of the strategy is largely on track at  
this halfway stage, and as we move  
into the third year of our strategy we are increasing our focus on ethical sourcing, environment and community.

07MANAGING DIRECTOR’S  
MESSAGE 
Safety is our highest priority and this 
year we have continued to focus on achieving our goal of zero harm. One  
of our core values is responsibility,  and as a business we are focused  on improving our safety culture by taking responsibility for the safety  
of our colleagues and ourselves. 
Our most significant risks relate  
to the processing of chemicals  at our manufacturing sites. This  
year we have improved our process  
safety management with the 
implementation of a new standard across our business that aligns  
with industry best practice. 
Our biggest non-manufacturing  
risk relates to driver safety. We have many employees who spend  
time driving on public roads, and  
this year we have continued to  
deliver defensive driving and riding training programs across the business. 
This year we have seen improvements 
in our overall safety performance. We reset our reporting metrics last  year and have since seen our lost time 
injury frequency rate (LTIFR) trending 
downwards. We have continued  to focus on injury prevention and  it has been pleasing to see some  
of our manufacturing sites achieve 
significant periods of time without  lost time injuries.
We have made some important steps 
towards our environmental objective  
of zero harm. We have two sites  with ISO14001 certification and two  more sites have plans to commence 
implementation in 2018. ISO104001 
establishes best practice environmental management systems and aligns  
with the requirements of our  
corporate standards.
Nufarm respects human rights and 
takes a zero tolerance stance on all forms of modern slavery in our business 
and supply chain. This year we 
developed our first human rights  policy and supplier code of conduct. We will continue to work towards ensuring our suppliers’ behaviours  
align with our values. We responded to feedback received 
through our employee survey by commencing a program to transform our global systems and processes  
and reshape our performance  
review process. We will continue  this journey in 2018. 
Our commitment to our customers  
is paramount. As the global demand for food and feed increases, we are looking at new ways to help growers maximise their production and  
manage their resources sustainably 
through innovative products and education programs.We strive to be a good 
company, one that’s open about our sustainability performance. In this report  
we outline the work we are doing to make Nufarm a  
safer and more sustainable business by improving  
our safety performance, responsibly managing our impact on the environment and making a positive contribution to the communities in which  
we operate. 
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
08Nufarm engages with the communities 
in the areas in which we operate through a variety of programs. We  
also engage with the wider agricultural 
industry through our support of the Nuffield farming scholarship program in Brazil and Australia. One of our 
objectives for 2018 is to start the 
development of a global community engagement strategy.
For us to grow our business and deliver 
value to our customers we will remain 
focused on improving our sustainability culture and performance. We will build

Nufarm aims to be open and 
transparent to our stakeholders  about our positive and negative 
environmental, social and economic 
impacts. In keeping with this objective, we are working to align our annual sustainability reporting with the core 
requirements of the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting standard. While not yet fully GRI compliant, we are moving towards  this for future years. 
This year we completed a preliminary 
materiality assessment to identify the sustainability topics relevant to Nufarm and our industry. A survey was used  
to complete the study, which involved 
senior business decision makers, such as the board of directors and executive leadership team. We did not engage directly with external stakeholders  but will conduct a full materiality 
assessment in the future. 
The findings of this study can be found 
in figure 1, and they have been used  
to guide the environmental, social  
and economic disclosures made  
in this year’s report.

10ENGAGING OUR STAKEHOLDERS
Nufarm operates its businesses  
with the involvement, support and interaction of a range of stakeholders. 
These include our employees, 
customers, suppliers, the local communities we operate in, government regulators, financiers  
and investors. We engage with the 
stakeholders who influence or are influenced by our business, consulting with them to understand their concerns and expectations and using the 
feedback to help shape our business 
strategy and plans. Table 4 provides  a list of our stakeholder groups  and the frequency with which  
we engage with them.
We have a variety of approaches to 
engaging with our stakeholders. Our agronomists in the field are in direct 
contact with the farming community, 
providing expertise to support the growers while receiving feedback  on the issues that matter to farmers.  
In Australia and New Zealand we  
have developed a formal customer  survey process to improve customer experience – The Voice of the Customer is a quarterly customer 
survey of our distribution channel 
partners with the feedback being used to drive change through the business. A similar program will be launched  
in the United Kingdom in 2018. 
We have formal mechanisms to engage 
with our employees, and at some  of our manufacturing sites we work 
with the local community through 
community development programs. Through our participation in industry associations such as CropLife and 
various chemical industry associations, 
we stay connected with industry-wide issues and contribute to their resolution. We often rely on these organisations to represent Nufarm’s 
interests to relevant government 
authorities when a collective response is required. Our interactions with  government regulators keep us 
engaged in the regulatory process. We have open lines of communication 
with our investor community enabling us to gather feedback on our activities 
and monitor issues important to them. 
To increase accessibility of information about our activities, we place a high priority on responding to feedback, 
questions or concerns and provide 
information on our corporate website.
Key topics raised by our stakeholders 
include:
•  Adverse weather conditions: Nufarm 
maintains a geographically diverse footprint, allowing unfavourable 
conditions in one region to be offset 
by favourable conditions in other parts of the business.
•  Development of Nufarm products  
to combat herbicide resistance management. Nufarm is actively 
involved in this space through the 
development of products, programs, technology and participation  in CropLife.

NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
12The health and safety of our people  
is our priority and this year we have continued to work towards a goal  
of zero harm; implementing and 
embedding processes that identify  and understand risks, hazards and preventative measures. This section 
details our performance in 2017.
The most significant hazards managed 
by Nufarm relate to the processing of various chemicals in our manufacturing 
sites. Across the global chemicals 
manufacturing industry, the appropriate risk controls to enable safe processing of these chemicals are well known and 
documented. Nufarm has developed  
its process safety management (PSM) standard based on these industry best practices. The Nufarm PSM standard addresses critical risk control factors 
such as facility design and construction, 
hazard identification, assessment and control, operations process safety, hazardous materials management, 
asset integrity and reliability, 
management of change, competence and training and emergency planning and response. Compliance with these requirements is audited by Nufarm and 
by the regulators in each jurisdiction  
in which we operate these facilities.
The most significant non-manufacturing 
hazard within Nufarm’s global business 
involves our staff driving on public roads, often in rural environments,  as a part of their job. Nufarm’s driver risk reduction program includes 
defensive driver training, specifying 
active and passive safety features on company vehicles, fatigue management, restricting mobile phone use and 
ensuring fitness to drive.
In our four-year sustainability strategy 
launched in 2015, incident elimination was highlighted as the key priority for 
the first two years. The impact resulting 
from this focus can be seen in the performance trends in figure 2.  In 2017, we strengthened our risk 
management with the completion  
of numerous initiatives investing  $14.6 million into our safety programs globally. In addition, several significant safety-related plant improvements  
commenced in 2017 that will be 
completed and reported in 2018.Safety performance
During 2015, we reset our injury reporting and classification processes to ensure that all injuries are reported 
and correctly classified, providing for 
consistent, company-wide safety performance measurement aligned with global best practice. This enables 
us to better investigate and address 
the root causes of serious injuries  and therefore better manage the risks. Figure 2 shows the 12-month weighted rolling average lost time injury frequency 
rate (LTIFR) across the last 18 months. 
The 18 months of data reported  here represents the period where  the sustainability strategy initiatives 
started to have impact including the 
improved reporting of incidents and their consistent classification providing greater confidence in the integrity  of our data recording.While no injury is acceptable  
at Nufarm this improvement 
demonstrates significant progress towards our goal of zero harm. 
This year our injuries have been 
predominantly sprains, cuts and 
contusions, along with several instances of chemical inhalation, all of which  were promptly and properly responded 
to. The severity of injuries that people 
experienced (as measured by the length of time required to be absent from work following the injury) is measured by the severity index  
graph in figure 3.
The injury severity index graph has 
taken a step upwards following an 
extended period of improvement.  
This is due to a shoulder injury to  a person reported earlier in the  year when he lifted a 15-litre  
drum of product leading to  
a to 54-day absence.

We are satisfied that our efforts are delivering an improvement in safety 
behaviours, practices and management of hazards, which is reflected in the  LTIFRs, particularly for Latin America and Asia. However, the rate of improvement 
has been below expectation in Australia and New Zealand, particularly in the 
non-crop protection parts of the business and also in North America. Additional resources have been directed to both the Australia and New Zealand crop protection and non-crop protection parts of the business to better address 
underlying hazards. Positive impacts from these interventions are expected  
in the coming reporting period.

NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
14During 2017, we achieved several 
significant safety milestones on our journey to zero harm. Our manufacturing 
site in Merak, Indonesia received a 
national zero accident award for having had no lost time injuries since 2010.  In January 2017, the Chicago Heights 
manufacturing site in North America achieved five years without incurring  
a lost time injury. Nufarm’s insecticide and fungicide manufacturing facility  
at Raymond Road, Australia, achieved 
more than four years without an LTI  in June. Raymond Road’s achievement is significant given the plant was 
redesigned and many areas rebuilt during this period. It was further 
reinforced by the site winning  Exporter of the Year at the 
Manufacturers Monthly Endeavour 
Awards in May, for its focus on  safety, quality and efficiency.
Health and safety audits
In delivering against our sustainability strategy we have changed our approach to internal global health  
and safety audits to focus on fewer  
but higher risk injury hazards and to  conduct a more detailed audit on these. In the audit program over the 
last two years a key assessment area 
has been safety culture and leadership at our manufacturing sites along with a  
focus on process safety management practices including hazardous materials 
processes and controls. Non-process 
safety risks including site vehicle safety and fall risks have also been closely reviewed. Good practices identified 
during these audits are transferred 
across to other sites facing similar challenges. Reports arising from and improvement actions identified through these site audits are sent through  to the group executive and board  
HSE committee.
Health and safety committees
There are active HSE committees 
across our business starting at the  
top with the board HSE committee. 
Site-based HSE committees provide  
an additional communication and 
planning channel to enable employees and management to work together on 
identifying improvements in employee 
engagement, safety culture and safety systems and to review and deploy lessons arising from incidents.Health and safety compliance
Nufarm operates a number of major hazard facilities (MHF) that are closely regulated by government. Safety 
authorities and regulators often require 
periodic confirmation and verification that adequate and sustained hazard controls are in place and effective  
at major hazard facilities.
For example, our sites in Europe  
(Wyke in the United Kingdom, Gaillon in France and Linz in Austria) all fall 
under Europe’s Seveso III directive.  
Our Wyke site has recently submitted its five-yearly control of major accident hazards (COMAH) safety report to the 
government regulator for its review.

NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
15SAFETY continued
In Australia, our Pipe Road facility is 
licensed as a MHF and has submitted their safety case for its five-yearly 
licence renewal and this is currently 
with WorkSafe for review. Our Raymond Road facility submitted its first safety case for licensing as a MHF in late 
2016. A decision is expected from 
WorkSafe in 2018.
While we recorded 17 incidents  
of non-compliance with regulatory 
occupational health and safety 
requirements across our global operations this year, these were all promptly addressed to the satisfaction 
of the relevant regulator. While the 
severity of this non-compliance was relatively low, Nufarm’s objective is  to be fully compliant with regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions  
in which it operates. 
Leveraging a One Nufarm 
approach to safety
HSE standard
Last year we developed a One Nufarm 
high level HSE standard with supporting 
procedures that define the boundaries within which all Nufarm sites and people must operate. This year we 
commenced applying these procedures 
at all our manufacturing locations. Particular focus has been placed  
on process safety management with  
the establishment of a global process 
safety management lead team to  
guide consistent deployment of these 
requirements across the business.
Safety training 
Each manufacturing site has run 
training programs for staff across  a wide range of topics. Training has  been delivered in the areas of confined 
space entry, working at heights,  
fire safety, site safety standards, 
behavioural safety training, 5S auditor 
training and HAZOP training. Training  
is delivered regularly and updated to meet Nufarm safety standards and  local regulatory requirements. This  year we provided approximately  
40,000 hours of safety training to  
our employees and contractors.Health and wellbeing 
In 2017 a number of initiatives across 
our sites focused on the health and wellbeing of our people. These have included physiotherapist-led training programs on lifting and stretching  
at Alsip and Chicago Heights in North 
America. The North American sites have also committed to increasing  the availability of healthy food on site 
with 50 per cent of all food available 
from vending machines designated  as healthy. 
The Linz site ran a health day for 
employees with a focus on healthy 
eating and being active. In Brazil,  a new health initiative, ‘Nufarm in movement’ was launched in partnership with the local community, to encourage people to exercise.
Sharing good practice
In addition to the initiatives  
deployed globally through the  
Nufarm sustainability strategy, individual sites share initiatives  around the world through a monthly sustainability report that enables the 
rapid transfer of solutions from one 
part of the business to other Nufarm sites facing similar challenges. One  of the practices that have been shared 
this year was the safety day events  
held at Fortaleza and Linz which will be replicated across Nufarm’s other sites. 
Other achievements
In May 2017, Nufarm Wyke in the 
United Kingdom won the Chemical Industries Association’s Company of 
the Year award. Amongst other things, 
the judging panel was impressed by Nufarm’s manufacturing excellence program which has driven safety improvements across the business  as well as shaping investment  
in development programs.
 Process safety management 
The process safety management (PSM) program was launched in January 2017. The program is designed to identify 
and control hazards at manufacturing 
sites where a loss of containment  could result in a catastrophic incident involving fatalities inside and/or 
outside the site boundary and/or 
significant environmental damage  or negative community impact.  This is a significant and critical undertaking for the business.
Each site completed a detailed PSM 
gap analysis comparing their site’s critical safety systems with the 
performance requirements of the 
Nufarm PSM standard and their local government regulatory requirements. Based on the gap analysis each site developed a PSM gap closure plan and 
will report quarterly on their progress. 
Each region and manufacturing site  
has allocated resources to ensure the 
successful and timely deployment  
of the requirements of the Nufarm  
PSM standard and its cascading 
detailed procedures. 
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
16A global PSM leadership team  
has been established to support  and guide each manufacturing site  
to meet the deployment milestones  
in a One Nufarm way. Leading and lagging PSM performance metrics  have been established, with a PSM 
program deployment progress report, 
metric reporting and analysis flowing through to the board HSE committee and the Nufarm executive.
Driver safety
One of the significant risks that  impacts our sales and customer-facing employees is driving on public roads.  
 
In 2017, Nufarm reviewed and updated  
its driver safety procedure specifying defensive driver training, fatigue 
management requirements, fitness  
to drive, vehicle safety specifications, mobile phone use and motorcycle  and all-terrain vehicle (ATV) training and safety. These requirements are 
being deployed across all Nufarm’s 
operations with the Latin American business taking a leading role. Defensive driver training programs have been delivered in many locations in 2017 including Colombia, Brazil, Malaysia and France and motorcycle safety training has continued to be 
rolled out in Indonesia. 
Forklift safety
Improvements were made to 
forklift safety in 2017 with the implementation of the blue beam 
light warning system for 
pedestrians deployed at Chicago Heights in 2016 and at the Merak site in Indonesia. The Chicago 
Heights, Gaillon, Fortaleza and 
Alsip sites also implemented physical barriers and designated walkways to keep pedestrians away from forklift traffic and the 
Gaillon and Fortaleza sites also 
conducted forklift defensive driver training.Objectives for 2018 
Looking forward to 2018, the key  areas of focused improvement for Nufarm will be its process safety 
management program, which 
commenced in 2017, global deployment of a behaviourally  
based driver safety program  
and greater engagement of staff  working in non-manufacturing roles.

NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
17Nufarm recognises that our social  
and environmental responsibilities 
extend beyond our own manufacturing 
footprint, and we have a strategic objective to ‘engage with our suppliers 
to uphold the same sustainability 
standards that we hold ourselves accountable to’. 
This year we started implementing  
the ethical sourcing activities set  
out in our sustainability strategy. 
Improving our purchasing systems
Over the last two years Nufarm has 
been working to upgrade our business 
systems to better support and leverage 
our global scale.
Our procurement team begun the 
implementation of a global supplier and procurement management system, 
Ariba. Nufarm sources materials 
globally and the deployment of Ariba in 2018 will support a standardised 
approach to negotiating and entering 
agreements with our suppliers in the future, giving us a greater capacity  
to integrate sustainability measures 
into our procurement processes.
Respecting human rights  
in our supply chain
Nufarm developed its first human  
rights policy in 2017, in which we  
set out our zero tolerance stance  
on all forms of modern slavery in  our operations and supply chain. 
A copy of our human rights policy  
can be found in the corporate 
governance section of our website.
We have published a modern slavery 
statement on the actions we’ve taken 
to identify and prevent modern slavery. A copy of this can be found on the 
homepage of our corporate website. 
Suppliers upholding our 
sustainability values
We have developed a global supplier 
code of conduct. This sets out Nufarm’s 
expectations of suppliers, including 
those relating to business ethics, environment, human rights, child  
and forced labour and employee  
health and safety.In 2018, we will progress the 
implementation of our supplier  
code of conduct by linking it to 
sourcing events through Ariba, and 
obtaining a contractual commitment 
from our new and existing suppliers  to uphold our sustainability values.
A copy of the supplier code of  
conduct is available in the corporate 
governance section of our website.
 
Supplier corporate social 
responsibility assessment
In 2017, Nufarm partnered with 
EcoVadis to conduct corporate social 
responsibility assessments of our 
suppliers. This process increases our supply chain transparency, which is an 
important step towards reducing our 
environmental and social footprint by working with responsible suppliers. 
EcoVadis is a global leader in this  
field, providing corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) ratings and 
scorecards for over 20,000 suppliers. The collaborative platform evaluates 
suppliers’ policies, actions and results, 
focusing on four main criteria:
•  Environment – assesses the supplier’s 
stewardship of resources during 
operations and the sustainability  
of the products it produces.
•  Social – evaluates a supplier’s working 
conditions and the health and safety 
policies for its employees. This also 
addresses human rights issues, such as child and forced labour.
•  Ethics – evaluates the supplier’s 
business practices, such as bribery 
and competitive practices.
•  Sustainable procurement – evaluates 
the supplier’s procurement practices.
 In 2017, Nufarm assessed 23 per cent 
of its existing suppliers (measured as a 
percentage of total spend), and we will be establishing targets for on-boarding 
suppliers in 2018.
Of the suppliers that were assessed, 
none were found to have significant social or environmental impacts in  
this reporting period and there was no  clear evidence of child or forced labour, 
although several suppliers failed to provide documentation to support  
their claims that they were compliant 
with globally acceptable practices.
Nufarm has not needed to terminate 
any business relationships due  to negative environmental or  
social impacts.
The CSR assessments will be  
repeated annually.
In 2018, we will begin including CSR 
assessment of new suppliers as one  
of the elements of our new supplier evaluation process. The adoption of 
EcoVadis has provided us with valuable 
insight into our suppliers’ sustainability practices and once the process of CSR 
assessment is embedded, we will use 
this to develop mutually agreed upon improvement plans with our lower 
rating suppliers.
Supplier risk management
A risk-based approach has been 
adopted to determine supplier priority 
for CSR assessment. This process 
considers the risk associated with  
the supplier’s country of operation, 
their importance to Nufarm and their 
product industry. Nufarm has a number of important chemical suppliers in 
China and India who were given  
a high priority for CSR assessment based on country risk. 
This process has been formalised  
with a new supply chain risk 
management policy, which  
will be implemented in 2018.
To support our risk management 
approach to procurement, Nufarm  has commenced the implementation  
of a global supply chain risk monitoring 
service, RiskMethod, which will be launched in 2018. RiskMethod monitors 
risks to the supply chain, such as 
financial, geopolitical, health and safety, natural disasters, labour and 
quality. Together RiskMethod and 
EcoVadis will provide Nufarm with  a solid platform for monitoring and 
responding to a broad spectrum  of supply chain risks. ETHICAL SOURCING
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
18Our people are the core of our 
business and their dedication and innovation continue to underpin our 
success. We are striving to build a 
diverse and inclusive workplace where new ways of thinking and working are harnessed to drive Nufarm forward.
This year Nufarm employed 3,189 
people across five regions, a decrease of two per cent from 2016, which can be attributed to rationalisation activities that were finalised in 2016. 
The majority of our workforce remains 
full time, permanent employees, however where the nature of the role allows it, we support flexible work 
arrangements. Our full employee  
data can be found in tables 6 and 7.
Throughout a normal year, we employ 
casual contract staff to respond to  
the peak manufacturing months.  
As of the end of 2017 we had an additional 14 per cent of seasonal workers contracted to work at our 
manufacturing sites. Nufarm also 
engages a small percentage of specialist, professional service providers, such as business and engineering consultants, to  
support projects as required.
Listening to our people
In October 2016, 84 per cent of Nufarm employees provided confidential feedback through our Nufarm 
employee opinion survey. The results  
of the survey and the agreed actions were communicated to all employees. We run employee opinion surveys  
every two years and in 2018 we will  
run a mid-cycle pulse check survey. 
In response to the employee opinion 
survey feedback we redesigned our 
performance management program  
in line with industry best practice. We have adopted a more agile approach  to objective setting that will ensure 
employee priorities and development 
goals are more closely aligned to the needs of the business. We have called this program Grow Plan Succeed (GPS).
With the introduction of our GPS cycle, 
all employees are expected to engage in regular check-in conversations with managers and matrix managers to 
frequently discuss performance and 
development in real time. Nufarm also committed to improving information technology systems 
following feedback from employees. 
These improvements are being delivered through an information technology transformation program that will continue into 2018. One of 
these projects is the implementation  
of a global human resources management system.
Developing new talent
To help grow our local talent we continue to expand our youth  strategy year on year through  
a variety of programs.
We have active internship and  
graduate programs in Brazil, the  
United Kingdom, North America  
and Australia. In Australia, we offered permanent roles to all graduates in the 2017 program. In Brazil, Nufarm runs an internship program for university 
students and two apprenticeship 
programs; one for students from local high schools that offers a seven-month work experience program and another 
for young people from the local community. Some of the participants  
in this internship program have gone 
on to permanent employment with 
Nufarm in the HR, IT and finance functions during 2017. 
Apprenticeships offer an important 
opportunity for young people to  
access the employment market.  
Our Wyke site in the United Kingdom  
takes on five apprentices each year  
into three apprenticeship programs; 
control and instrumentation, mechanical and process. 
This year 67 per cent of graduating 
apprentices at the Wyke site moved 
into permanent positions with Nufarm. The remainder are still in progress due to extensions or leaving the business 
with a completed apprenticeship. 
North America continued to build  
its partnership with Purdue University, providing placements for students 
through its engineering co-op program. 
This program brings fresh ideas to Nufarm’s engineering team while  
giving students valuable, real life  
work experience to supplement  
their classroom studies. OUR PEOPLE

Building on the successful partnership 
with Purdue University for engineering undergraduates, Nufarm North 
America created a similar relationship 
with Governor State University  for chemists to obtain analytical laboratory experience.
In Brazil, we offer employees  
the opportunity to participate in 
English lessons. This year there were approximately 30 employees from  
all levels of the business participating  
in the program, which combines classroom and online learning. Improved proficiency in English  
will enable employees in Brazil to participate more fully at a global level. 
Respecting human rights 
This year we developed a human rights policy that includes our zero tolerance stance on all forms of modern slavery in 
both our organisation and supply chain. 
In implementing this policy we have completed modern slavery risk assessments in 50 per cent of our 
regions. This process assesses the 
adequacy of our measures to identify and prevent modern slavery within our own business and in the use of contract labour. These risk assessments will be 
completed in 2018 for the remaining 
regions. In meeting our obligations under the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act we have published a 
modern slavery statement. This can  
be found on the homepage of our corporate website, while our human rights policy can be found in the corporate governance section  
of our website.
Nufarm’s human rights policy  
recognises and respects employees’ 
rights and freedom to join or not to  
join organisations of their choosing, to associate freely and bargain collectively. Some of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
Career Transition
Nufarm continues its improvement journey this year, implementing the new business systems and processes 
needed to support its strategic growth 
plans. To make this journey possible, we have increased our technical expertise with more than 10 per cent additional professional employees compared to last year. 
Nufarm provides career transition 
support for employees leaving  the business due to retirement  
or termination. In the future we  
will have the systems in place  to quantify this globally.
Diversity and inclusion 
We believe that diversity and inclusion are critical to the sustainable growth  of our company through positively 
building our talent and developing  
an inclusive culture within  
the organisation.
In 2017, we revised our diversity  
and inclusion policy to reflect contemporary best practice. In 2018, we will implement this policy using a self-assessment and action planning 
tool kit. Our diversity and inclusion 
policy can be found in the corporate governance section of our website.
This year we have continued to 
encourage diversity and inclusion across the business. In Australia and New Zealand, we undertook a diversity and inclusion diagnostic and using this 
as a pilot, we will extend the process to 
our other regions to better understand our challenges and opportunities globally. We will then develop a 
meaningful and appropriate diversity 
and inclusion strategy that can be measured and monitored.
Other key initiatives this year include 
the ongoing work to improve female 
representation across all areas of the business and the continued support of a cross-cultural change leader network. 
We developed inclusive leadership and 
unconscious bias training to help build more diverse and inclusive work environments. This will be rolled out globally in 2018 and our objective is  
to train at least 25 per cent of people 
managers within the next year.
Women at Nufarm
Australia and New Zealand 
implemented smaller selling territories 
as part of a reorganisation and in response to employee feedback. Reducing selling territory size will 
benefit parents returning to work and 
reduce time spent travelling. This will also reduce driving-related safety risks and improve work-life balance for  all sales employees.
While female representation across  
the business remains at 23 per cent again this year we have been actively 
working to increase this. Board level 
female representation increased from  13 per cent to 22 per cent with the appointment of a new board member. Female representation also increased  
in people leadership positions from  
17 per cent to 20 per cent and  29 per cent of all internal candidates promoted were female. 
Across our regions, female 
representation has remained stable with a slight increase in the Latin American region, refer to table 6.  
In the European region, we continue  
to target gender diversity, leveraging union and collective agreements to improve gender and pay equality.

A diverse workplace
We supply products in more than 
100 countries across five regions.  Our global footprint provides us with  a culturally diverse workforce of leaders 
and teams, representing local cultures 
and customers. The Nufarm leadership team is culturally diverse, with at least six different cultural backgrounds reflected in the executive group, 
representing the company’s  
diverse global footprint.
In 2017, we established a cross- 
cultural change leader network to  
bring together people leaders from  all regions, functions and businesses  
to support our business transformation and increase global collaboration  
as One Nufarm. This group represents  the voice of the business and provides 
feedback on global initiatives. It is 
provided with information and resources to support the changes  being introduced in their regions. 
 North America continues to leverage  
the unique talents of individuals  
living with disabilities through  the ‘Partners in Caring’ initiative  
in partnership with Seroma Center.  
Across Nufarm, four per cent of our employees have a disclosed physical  or mental disability.

NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
23Nufarm is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and has a range of  
policies and procedures in place to support this aim. Details of board committees and their terms  
of reference, along with other corporate policies and protocols, can be found in the governance 
section of our website. Nufarm is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and we  
comply with the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (the Principles).
Board of directors
The governing body of the company  
is the board of directors. The board’s responsibility is to oversee the company’s 
operations and ensure that Nufarm 
carries out its business in the best interests of all shareholders and  with proper regard to the interests  
of all other stakeholders. 
The board charter defines the board’s 
individual and collective responsibilities and describes those responsibilities 
delegated to the managing director 
and senior executives. A copy of  the board charter is available on  the corporate governance section  
of the company’s website.
Board members are selected based  
on their experience and skills  
to ensure the board properly  
discharges its responsibilities. 
There are nine members of the board 
and as at the date of this report, most 
of the directors are independent with 
the exception of Dr Bruce Goodfellow and Toshikazu Takasaki (non-executive directors) and Greg Hunt (managing director and chief executive officer).  
As a major shareholder in Nufarm, 
Sumitomo Chemical Company’s interests are represented by one board 
member position, which has been held 
by Takasaki-san since 2012.
The board reviews its composition  
and terms of reference annually.  
It also evaluates the performance  and determines remuneration of  the managing director and senior executives. Full details of the executive 
remuneration structure are set out in 
the remuneration report on pages 27 to 42 of Nufarm’s 2017 annual report.
Board committees
The board is supported by four committees: the audit and risk 
committee; the nomination and 
governance committee; the human resources (HR) committee; and the health, safety and environment  
(HSE) committee. 
The HSE committee is responsible  
for reviewing and reporting to the board on strategic matters including 
significant environmental and safety 
issues. It provides oversight on the annual sustainability report and,  in conjunction with the board,  
has approved the group’s  
sustainability strategy.The responsibilities of the HR 
committee include reviewing and 
making recommendations to the  board in relation to Nufarm’s board  and executive remuneration strategy, structure and practice. The committee  
is responsible for seeking and approving independent remuneration advisers  
who provide independent remuneration advice, as appropriate, on board,  
chief executive officer and other  
key management personnel remuneration strategy, structure, practice and disclosure.
The HSE and HR committees have joint 
oversight of Nufarm’s material social aspects while making recommendations to the board on matters of policy and 
practice. Copies of both the HSE and 
HR committees’ charters are available on the corporate governance section  of the company’s website
The responsibilities of the nomination 
and governance committee include composition of the board, reviewing the mix of skills and diversity on the 
board and recommending changes to 
the board membership and whether  to support the re-election of a retiring director. In conjunction with the human GOVERNANCE

selection of board members. In FY17, 
the board comprised 22 per cent women. A copy of the committee’s charter and a summary of the  
policy and procedure for director 
appointments are available on  the corporate governance section  of the company’s website. 
Each year each board committee will 
self-assess whether it has discharged  its responsibility as set out in its charter.
Executive leadership
The board has delegated authority  for the daily management of Nufarm’s environmental and social aspects to  
the executive leadership team. 
Reporting directly to the CEO, the group executive for manufacturing  and supply chain, Elbert Prado, is 
responsible for environment and safety, 
while John Holding, group executive for people and performance, is responsible for the other social  aspects of Nufarm’s operations.
Conflict of interest
Board members must identify any conflict of interest they may have in dealing with the company’s affairs and 
then refrain from participating in any 
discussion or voting on these matters. Further information on this policy can be found in the board charter, available in the corporate governance section of the company’s website. Directors and senior executives must disclose any 
related party transaction in writing.
Information on cross-board 
memberships and major shareholdings  
is made publicly available to interested 
parties as it arises through our annual 
financial report and statements  released to the ASX.
Code of conduct
Nufarm’s code of conduct guides our work and represents our commitment to fair, ethical and professional business 
practices and legislative requirements. 
We require all Nufarm directors, employees, contractors and consultants to be familiar with and uphold the 
company’s code of conduct in all 
business dealings. Wherever we operate, the health and safety of our people, our contribution to sustainable development, and conducting business 
with integrity are key priorities in 
delivering value to our shareholders and stakeholders. We build strong, mutually beneficial relationships  
with the communities we operate  
in, respecting their laws and customs.  We are politically impartial except where the board believes it is necessary to comment due to any perceived 
major impact on the company, its 
business or any of its stakeholders. Other policies
Where there are no legislative requirements with which to comply,  we develop policy statements to 
support the code of conduct and 
ensure appropriate standards are  met. These policies include the communications policy, diversity policy, 
security trading policy and continuous 
disclosure protocol. We have a whistle-blower policy to provide employees with a confidential mechanism to  report any suspected unethical or 
illegal behaviour. Nufarm’s code of 
conduct and additional policies can  be found in the corporate governance section of the company’s website.
Our regional legal counsel teams have 
provided training in our anti-corruption policies this year. In the future, our  
new HR business system will track  
and record training. 
Risk management
The board is committed to identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing its material business risks. To that end, the 
board has implemented a sound risk 
management framework, which it reviews at least annually to ensure  its effectiveness.

25GOVERNANCE continued
The board is responsible for the 
oversight of the company’s risk management system. The board makes 
sure that appropriate policies are in 
place to ensure compliance with risk management controls and requires management to monitor, manage  
and report on business risks.
The board delegates certain 
responsibilities to board committees and primarily to its audit and risk 
committee, which is chaired by  
an independent director. The audit  and risk committee’s responsibilities include providing an oversight  
of the effectiveness of Nufarm’s 
enterprise-wide risk management  and internal control framework.  In so doing, it considers the interests  of all relevant stakeholders. 
The company recognises a number  
of operational risks related to its  crop protection business, including: 
•  market consolidation;
•  climate conditions and seasonality;
•  regulatory, freedom to operate, 
product registration, product use  and business sustainability;•  human resources and change 
management;
•  relationships with key suppliers 
and customers; and
•  licences and operating permits  
for manufacturing facilities. 
Further information can be found  in Nufarm’s audit and risk committee charter and risk oversight and management, both available in  
the corporate governance section  
of the company’s website.
Critical environmental or social 
concerns are reported directly to  
the board as they arise and delegated 
by the board to the relevant group executive for resolution. There were  
no critical environmental or social 
concerns to report to the board this year. There have been no new legal actions against the company this year 
for anti-competitive behaviour, anti-
trust or monopoly practice; however, there is one ongoing investigation  into anti-competitive behaviour  in agribusinesses in Hungary, of  
which Nufarm Hungaria is one. Memberships
While Nufarm does not subscribe to 
any externally developed sustainability charters or principles, we do practice 
the standards established by a number 
of industry groups to which we belong. Nufarm is a member of Responsible Care, a global, voluntary initiative 
developed by the chemical industry 
that operates in 52 countries. 
The Sustainable Agriculture Initiative 
(SAI) platform is an initiative aimed  
at contributing to the development  
of sustainable agriculture. We also participate in chemical industry associations in a number of countries 
such as CIA in the United Kingdom, 
and Chemistry Australia and other associations such as CropLife.
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
26ENVIRONMENT
Working towards environmental 
best practice
Nufarm’s goal is zero harm to the 
environment; we are committed  to avoiding or minimising the actual  
and potential environmental impacts  
of our operations. 
Last year we developed a new 
corporate health, safety and 
environment standard, raising the bar on the environmental requirements of our business. This year we developed the underlying corporate procedures, 
setting out Nufarm’s expectations in 
our key environmental risk areas: waste  
and emissions, soil and groundwater protection, and resource use  
and conservation.
We commenced environmental gap 
analysis against these standards at  our manufacturing operations and  
will complete these at all our locations 
in 2018, establishing environmental improvements plans and deploying  
our environmental improvement 
program across the business. 
Our approach to environmental 
management is one of robust 
identification of environmental impacts and assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of their layers of controls. We then implement management 
systems to maintain the controls  
and drive continuous environmental improvement through the organisation. This approach is fully implemented  
at our Wyke, United Kingdom, and 
Gaillon, France, sites, where we continue to maintain our ISO14001 environmental management systems certification. Our sites in Linz, Austria, 
and Pipe Road, Australia, have both 
committed to implementing ISO14001 environmental management systems, and these two-year projects will commence in 2018.
We provide environmental training  
to our people, this year investing over 1,000 hours in the activity, and our efforts have been rewarded. At our 
Merak site in Indonesia, the local 
district presented Nufarm with an award for being an eco-friendly company, recognising compliance  and community development activities.Our environmental footprint
We work to reduce our environmental footprint at our manufacturing sites with innovative solutions to the 
challenges we face. Our environmental 
results for this year can be found  in tables 9 and 10. 
Energy
Our synthesis activities are our  most energy intensive, consuming approximately 80 per cent of our total 
energy use. We purchase and generate 
our own steam for heating raw materials and production vessels. Our site in  Linz, Austria, reuses waste steam  
and ammonia generated by other 
manufacturers in Chemiepark, the complex in which we are located. Chemiepark is an industrial park  where a number of large chemical 
companies operate from the same  
site, gaining efficiencies from  shared manufacturing services.
For improved energy efficiency,  
we have a combined heat and power (CHP) plant on our site at Wyke, 
controlled by a third party. Our energy 
reduction this year is mostly due to a change in product mix at our manufacturing sites, efficiency gains from our manufacturing rationalisation 
and some energy improvement 
initiatives.
This year our manufacturing sites 
continued to upgrade lighting to LED 
and improve the efficiency of steam distribution systems. We installed a new boiler at our manufacturing site  in Gaillon, France, which is expected  
to reduce the site’s total energy 
consumption by 10 per cent in 2018. We implemented power factor correction at Pipe Road, Australia,  and we installed an economiser on  the CHP plant operating from Wyke,  
in the United Kingdom; both projects  
will deliver energy savings outside  of Nufarm in 2018.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Being in the agricultural industry  we witness first hand the impacts of extreme weather events attributable  
to climate change, and we recognise we have a role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This year 
our greenhouse gas emissions were two per cent lower than 2016,  with a corresponding reduction  
of seven per cent in greenhouse gas 
intensity. While some of this reduction came from energy improvement initiatives, lower energy use and increased renewable energy in the 
electricity network also contributed  
to the reduction. 
We also had a leak of a non-ozone 
depleting refrigerant from one of  
our manufacturing facilities that accounted for four per cent of our  total greenhouse gas emissions. This occurred over two reporting years,  
so the other half of the emissions will 
be reported in 2018. The preventative maintenance controls are under  review to avoid a reoccurrence  
of this situation.
Other air emissions
Our air emissions result from steam-
generating boilers and our formulation processes. We make efforts to control 
these with scrubbers, reducing their 
environmental impact and eliminating potential odour-causing emissions. In an effort to prevent odour impacting 
on our local community at Maracanaú 
in Brazil, the site conducted odour training for a group of its manufacturing employees so they can rapidly identify and correct odour-causing issues. 
We are committed to reducing our  
air emissions and to this end we have constructed an incinerator at our  
site in Linz, Austria, to eliminate our 
hazardous air pollutant (HAP). This will be commissioned in early 2018 and we will also trial incinerator technology at the same site to reduce some of our 
volatile organic compound (VOC) air 
emissions. If successful, these projects should reduce our annual VOC  and HAP emissions by as much  
as 12 tonnes. 
NOx, SOx and CO emissions  
are generated by our boilers and  the increase this year is primarily  
due to an increase in fuel use.
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
27ENVIRONMENT continued
Waste and effluent
We work to find innovative ways to 
reduce waste streams or reduce the environmental impact of the waste. 
This year our site in Wyke, United 
Kingdom, built a solvent extraction plant. This plant is currently being commissioned and when fully 
operational will greatly reduce the 
chemical oxygen demand of the site’s effluent. The site also established an alternative disposal method for one  of its waste streams. From 2018, 40 
tonnes of waste that would have been 
incinerated off-site will now be reused by another chemical manufacturer.
At our site in Gaillon, France, we 
developed a process to clean empty containers, diverting 28 tonnes of waste from incineration to recycling and eliminating 43 tonnes of scope 3 
greenhouse gas emissions at the same 
time. A concerted focus on improved waste management at our Alsip plant 
in Chicago, North America, resulted 
in over 500 tonnes of waste eliminated when compared to last year, which represents more than 30 per cent  
of the site’s total waste.
Strict quality controls and 
manufacturing product mix have  
a strong influence on our ability to 
recycle and reuse water. We have 
further strengthened these controls  
this year and as a result have increased our volume of wastewater. We are now 
working to find innovative solutions  
to minimise this waste stream and  share the solutions across all our manufacturing operations.
Our sites discharge effluent and 
rainwater in line with their local effluent discharge limits, and at some locations we have onsite effluent treatment and cooling to ensure these requirements are met. We monitor our effluent 
discharges and one of the main 
components of our effluent is salt, which is a waste product of our phenoxy synthesis operations.  
We have had no significant impact  
on natural water bodies from  either effluent discharges or  run-off from our sites this year.Soil and groundwater
A major focus at our manufacturing sites is the prevention of loss of containment of chemicals that  
could result in soil or groundwater 
contamination. We have control measures in place to prevent loss of containment incidents and minimise  
the risk of them impacting on soil or 
water. This year we have continued with routine groundwater monitoring  at several of our sites and carried  out studies to identify legacy 
contamination issues. 
In 2017, we discovered a leaking 
underground effluent pipe at our 
manufacturing site in Linz, Austria,  
and it is estimated up to 3,000KL of wastewater was released into the soil. The leak was fully contained within  the manufacturing site and presented  
no risk to human health or the wider 
environment. The soil is currently  being remediated and leak detection 
equipment has been installed to 
prevent a future reoccurrence.Environmental compliance  
and complaints
We have a goal of zero non-compliance 
with regulatory requirements, but unfortunately have had four non-
compliances with environmental 
regulations this year. These were promptly responded to and we continue to work closely with our  
local environmental regulators to  
close any outstanding issues. We  
have not received any monetary fines or sanctions related to these incidents.
Where required, sites undertake 
compliance testing of their emissions  to the environment. As a result of our manufacturing rationalisation in 2016 
there were less sites to monitor in 2017 
and therefore less compliance tests required to be carried out compared with last year. As was the case in 2016, we again achieved > 99 per cent 
compliance for our sites as can  
be seen in figure 6. 
While most of our sites are in  industrial areas, some operate  close to residential neighbourhoods and from time to time we receive complaints from our neighbours.  
This year we had five noise and  odour complaints where our 
investigations revealed our operations were the cause. We have processes in 
place to quickly respond and rectify  
any concerns raised by our neighbours. Figure 6: Environmental tests

NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
30Product stewardship at Nufarm is the 
way we bring responsible and ethical management to our agricultural 
chemicals and seeds. Through our 
sustainability strategy we are looking  to establish a structured, global product stewardship program, to 
further strengthen the responsibility  
we take for our products throughout their entire lifecycle.
All our new products undergo 
extensive evaluation and field trials  
to ensure that they comply with relevant regulatory requirements.  We refine our formulations and  
their use patterns to minimise their 
environmental impact and educate  our customers and consumers in  their safe use and disposal.
Developing for lower 
environmental impacts
We work to improve the environmental 
profile of products through a number of techniques such as substitution  
of solvents and adjuvants with either 
natural materials or ones with a lower ecological toxicity profile. We also work to increase the concentration of our 
products to improve transportation 
efficiency and refine the formulations  to support lower on-field chemical application rates. 
Spray drift stewardship
Drift is the airborne movement of 
agricultural chemicals in the form  of droplets or vapour away from  their intended target. Chemical drift 
from spray applications is a growing  
concern in agricultural areas due to  the potential, unintended impact it can have on neighbouring crops, animals, 
human health and the environment.Responsible crop protection begins 
with developing products with lower drift capability and then equipping farmers with the knowledge and support they need to ensure their  
spray remains within the targeted area.
Reducing drift is a priority within our 
business and our focus has been on 
finding ways to reduce the off-target 
risks from some of our core herbicide molecules. We are working to improve formulations and tank mixtures by reducing their volatility and physical 
drift and have done extensive testing 
on drift using a spray chamber and wind tunnel to replicate a range of conditions. We are using these results 
to develop a range of new products 
and improve existing ones. 
Correct application is just as important 
as the product design, and weather is  
a critical spray parameter as spraying in 
the wrong conditions has the potential to cause drift. We provide a number  of support tools to help growers 
understand when to spray; such as 
Spraywise Decisions
®, an online tool  
to help farmers select optimal spraying time. A range of other factors also 
need to be considered when spraying, 
such as spray equipment set-up and matching the right nozzle to the crop protection product. We provide local 
education programs to both growers 
and our channel partners with a  focus on maximising the effectiveness of their spray while minimising off-target impacts.
Recommendations to improve spray 
quality have been included on labels  to reduce spray drift in Australia. We 
are conducting ongoing research to 
enhance the roll-out of these initiatives.This is a significant, ongoing project for the business, one which is providing us with a knowledge platform that could allow the learning to be transferred  
to other products in the future.
Supply chain
At Nufarm supply chain stewardship 
begins with the sourcing of raw materials and packaging. This year we 
engaged EcoVadis, a leader in supplier 
corporate social responsibility (CSR) assessment, to conduct corporate CSR assessments of our key raw material 
suppliers. Next year we will begin work 
with lower-performing suppliers to improve some of their practices. 
In Europe, we have an ongoing  
process to ensure our existing 
purchased materials are REACH compliant. REACH, or registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction 
of chemicals, is a European Union 
chemicals regulatory process that has been put in place to further improve the protection of human health and minimise environmental risks. REACH 
compliance is now a standard element 
of our raw material sourcing process.
Supply chain stewardship continues 
through to the distribution of our 
products. As a global supplier, it is necessary for us to rely on the services of third party distributors as well as our own. Where possible we manufacture 
locally, reducing the cost and 
environmental impact of transporting liquid products long distances. We apply United Nations (UN) packaging 
standards to our products to protect 
them on their journey so they arrive at our customers in the same condition  as they left our sites.PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
31PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP continued
In Latin America, we have a product 
stewardship program, Nufarm Care,   cornerstone of which is educating 
distribution partners and customers  
in the correct and safe, storage  and transport of our products. 
Integrated pest management
Integrated pest management  is the combination of a range of  crop management methods aimed  
at delivering more effective and 
sustainable pest control strategies. Some of these methods include biological controls, crop rotation  
and cultivation techniques, using 
disease resistant plant variates  and chemical controls.
Finding biological solutions to pest 
management
Biorationals are one of the fastest 
growing segments in crop protection and another area of research and development for us. Biorationals are 
made from materials that are mostly 
derived from natural or biological origins; they provide a sustainable solution to the increasing global 
demand for food but with  
lower environmental impacts.  Nufarm is committed to developing  a range of biorational products to complement our existing synthetic 
chemistry products and be used  
in conjunction with them. 
In 2017, Nufarm began sales and of 
marketing several biorational products 
across the business and has others that are awaiting regulatory approval. We became the distributor for bio-ferm products in Canada, France, Belgium, 
the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal  
and Turkey. Bio-ferm produces Botector
® a biological botryticide  
for berry and grape growers and Blossom Protect
™ used for fire blight 
control and storage diseases in pome fruit when applied pre-harvest. 
Nufarm also markets Phero-Ball
®,  
a unique product developed by M2i 
Life Sciences in France. Phero-Ball® contains a pheromone used to control 
the pine processionary moth by 
creating mating disruption. Nufarm markets Neem Azal
™ in Belgium and 
the Netherlands. Neem Azal™ is a 
bio-pesticide used to control insect pests in ornamental and vegetable 
crops. In Australia and New Zealand, 
Nufarm has an agreement to develop and commercialise Grandevo
™ from 
Marrone BioInnovations. Grandevo™  
is a bio-insecticide for the control  of mealy bugs on grape vines. In Brazil 
we market Armigen
™ to control 
helicoverpa in major summer  
crops, like soybean and cotton.
Pest resistance
Pest resistance is an ongoing threat  
to global food security and a key  driver of the need for integrated pest 
management. Nufarm continues to 
focus resources in this space, helping growers to improve crop productivity. 
We participate on CropLife’s local and 
regional resistance committees; IRAC, FRAC and HRAC (insecticide, fungicide and herbicide resistance action 
committees). We are involved in 
research projects to further our understanding of resistance mechanisms. This year in Brazil and Argentina we launched ZethaMaxx  
a product designed to target the 
growing problem of glyphosate-resistant weeds in soybean.
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary 
Croplands, we continue to manufacture and market WEEDit, a sprayer that uses up to 70 per cent less chemicals with its infra-red, chlorophyll detection 
sensors. Through appropriate use,  
this equipment helps tackle herbicide 
resistance and retains soil moisture profiles during summer months, leading to more productive, sustainable farm land.
We also have a range of initiatives  
and decision tools to support and educate growers in managing herbicide 
resistance. The CATS (CombAt 
Troublesome weedS) platform in the United States provides comprehensive integrated weed management solutions to help growers control and prevent the development of resistant weed populations. In conjunction with 
the Australian growers, we developed 
Weed Logic, a tool that provides the growers with a medium term strategy  for sustainable and cost-effective 
resistance management. 
In Australia, Nufarm is a sponsor  
of WeedSmart (weedSmart.org.au),  a program where industry, governments 
and universities have partnered  
to enhance on-farm practices and promote the long term, sustainable  use of herbicides.
Responsible use
We actively work with customers  
and growers to educate them in  
the responsible and safe use of our 
products. Globally we belong to 
CropLife, an international organisation that undertakes stewardship  
activities and advocates for the  
safe and sustainable use of crop protection products.
This year Nufarm engaged a spray 
application specialist, based in the 
Australia and New Zealand region,  
to deliver training for growers and  who has conducted several education and stewardship days for our channel 
partners. The program contributes 
towards the Agsafe chemical handling accreditation which is a legal requirement for selling agricultural chemicals. Agsafe is a not-for-profit 
organisation that fosters three 
programs for the environmentally safe handling, storage, transportation and disposal of agricultural and veterinary 
chemicals and containers in Australia.
In the United Kingdom, we have 
developed a grassmanship program designed to promote best practice 
agriculture by providing livestock 
farmers with information on management practices to help maintain and improve the long term productivity 
and profitability of their farms.  
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
32In particular, we focus on sensitive  
pasture areas and partner with water  authorities to protect waterways  
from agricultural chemical use. 
In Australia, Nufarm continues  
to support Spraywise
® Decisions,  
an innovative internet subscription  service that helps rural landholders  
and contractors to better plan  
and match the timing of chemical applications to prevailing local weather. Nufarm also runs Spraywise
® which has 
been instrumental in helping growers better manage their spraying activities, 
minimising drift, reducing chemical use 
and maximising spray effectiveness.
Glyphosate stewardship
Glyphosate is one of our core molecules 
and while extensive scientific evaluation 
by public authorities has concluded that glyphosate poses no unacceptable risks 
to either health or the environment if 
used according to the manufacturer’s label, glyphosate continues to be  
a high-profile topic. In June 2016 
glyphosate was relicensed in Europe  
for 18 months and is due to be reviewed 
in December 2017. Nufarm’s has responded to the regulatory changes  
in Europe and our European glyphosate 
portfolio complies with the new 
European Union requirements  for glyphosate composition. 
Nufarm is a member of the European 
glyphosate task force and our European strategy focuses on products that are fully compliant with the new, lower-use rate conditions of registration. In North 
America, we are a member of the joint 
glyphosate task force, formed to generate data in support of regulatory re-evaluation. In Australia, Nufarm is 
part of the glyphosate sustainability 
working group, an industry-based  
body that forms recommendations  
and advice on how to ensure the longevity of glyphosate via strategies to mitigate resistance issues. Product labelling
The agricultural chemical product 
registration process is very comprehensive and we comply  with all national and international 
requirements in the countries we  
sell our products. All our products  are labelled to meet regulatory requirements which includes a 
statement of active ingredients.  
We provide consumers with detailed information and safety data sheets (SDS) on the safe handling and use, storage and appropriate disposal.
In Europe, we are well progressed 
towards the REACH compliance deadline of May 2018 for the substances covered by legislation and that are manufactured at our European sites. 
Container management and  
obsolete stock
At the end of a product’s life we  
partner with local service providers 
and non-profit organisations for the safe collection of empty containers. In  
Brazil, we work with inpEV, in Australia, DrumMuster, in the United States, the Ag Container Recycling Council (ACRC) and with PAMIRA’s agricultural packaging recovery system in Germany, 
to name a few. These organisations  
and others collect used agricultural 
chemical packaging from farmers and distributors and recycle the materials. Through these mechanisms, we reduce 
the impact our products have on landfill 
space and on non-renewable resources. 
Through our product life cycle 
management process we closely 
manage the withdrawal of products 
from the market and work with authorities and customers to ensure  the changes are communicated 
through to consumers. In parallel,  
we have formulation development activities underway to ensure a smooth transition to a replacement product. 
“In 2017, Nufarm begun 
marketing several biorational 
products across the business  
and has others that are awaiting 
regulatory approval.”
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
33COMMUNITY
Nufarm is committed to building a 
company that delivers a sustainable future for our people, our customers 
and the communities in which we 
operate. We aim to make a positive contribution to these communities  as well as society as a whole, and 
specifically the farming community. 
We operate in a diverse number  
of locations and countries where our manufacturing sites develop their own 
community engagement programs to 
best fit their local environment. Many of our manufacturing sites are in industrial zones; however, there are 
several that are close to residential 
areas and in these locations we  work closely with local communities. 
Engaging with the communities  
in which we work
In North America, Nufarm’s  
Chicago Heights and Alsip sites  have a partnership with the Chicago 
High School for Agricultural Sciences 
(CHAS). The students are involved in several activities, including working on the Idea Farm located at Nufarm’s Alsip 
site. The students use the Idea Farm  
to plant crops and keep beehives.  
In 2017, Nufarm also provided the 
opportunity for students to shadow Nufarm employees for a day and gain 
an understanding of working in the crop 
protection and agriculture industries. 
At the Gaillon site in Normandy, 
France, Nufarm engages in several 
community activities. These include  an annual briefing on Nufarm’s safety and environmental activities to local community leaders and sponsorship  
of local football and athletic teams.  
We partner with the regional chemical union to run a student program, providing onsite training for local high 
school students covering all aspects of 
site operations, including sustainability. 
At Nufarm’s Wyke site in the United 
Kingdom, we provide support and 
sponsorship for local community 
groups and charities, including local children’s charities and sports teams. Nufarm also sponsors an annual chemistry award at the University  of Bradford. 
In Merak, Indonesia, Nufarm 
contributes to the local community through initiatives including fruit tree planting, supporting a local school  
and clearing weeds in municipal  
areas. Nufarm also provides internship opportunities for students from  local high schools. 
These programs would not be such  
a success without the dedication of Nufarm employees who volunteered over 400 hours of their time to our  
local communities this year.
Greencare for Troops
In 2017, Nufarm became a  
major supporter of Greencare  for Troops in North America. 
Greencare for Troops provides 
lawn and landscape services to the families of deployed military personnel and post 9/11 veterans. 
Our North America turf and 
ornamental business committed to a financial contribution of US$150,000 to support the 
program. Nufarm’s contribution 
will enable Greencare for Troops to expand its program and support more military families  
and veterans. Nufarm’s 
partnership with Greencare  for Troops will extend our community participation in  the United States and provide 
opportunities for our employees 
to volunteer and participate in this program.Supporting education  
and innovation in farming
In 2017, Nufarm sponsored a  
Nuffield scholarship in Brazil through the Nuffield international program.  
The Nuffield Farming Scholarship 
program provides a unique opportunity for farmers and agribusiness professionals to travel internationally  
for a minimum of 16 weeks, researching agricultural production, distribution, management and/or communication. This year was the first time there had been a scholarship offered exclusively 
to a scholar from Brazil. We have 
agreed to continue our support  for this program in 2018. 
In 2018, Nufarm will sponsor  
a scholarship for a primary  producer from South Australia. 
In addition to funding the scholarships, 
Nufarm has supported the program  
by providing travel support and advice  
to scholars through its global network. 
Looking ahead
Community is one of the pillars  of Nufarm’s sustainability strategy.  Our strategic objective for community  
is to ‘Support our society through 
developing community, strengthening partnerships and ensuring alignment with or exceeding community 
standards for corporate behaviours’. 
In 2018, we will commence development 
of a global policy that establishes expectations across Nufarm regarding 
community engagement as core to  
our business sustainability and social licence to operate. We will also commence work on the development  
of a strategy and framework for our 
regions and manufacturing sites.
NUFARM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
34Making a difference in 
Maracanaú
Nufarm’s manufacturing site in  
Brazil is in the Maracanaú district  of Fortaleza, close to residential areas. 
Recognising the site’s important role  
in this community, Nufarm developed its socio-environmental responsibility program in 2009.
Nufarm commissioned a study to 
understand local businesses and the primary needs of the community close to our Maracanaú manufacturing site in Brazil, and we found we had some work to do to improve our standing. With the results of the study, we 
developed a social responsibility 
policy designed to make Nufarm more sustainable. Our goal was  
to make tangible contributions to  
the development of the community adjacent to our facility and improve our relations with the local community. 
In 2015, a social responsibility 
committee of employees from all 
areas of the Maracanaú site was established. The committee agreed  a program of activities with a focus  
on training, education, sport and 
health. An employee volunteer program was established and this has seen employees involved in delivering education and training to residents,  
as well as supporting local schools  
and kindergartens. In the public  schools in Maracanaú, Nufarm works  to raise awareness of the importance  
of environmental preservation.  
The initiative also sponsors sports programs, aiming to improve the quality of life through leisure activities and the use of public spaces.
To help residents better understand  
our business they are invited to visit  the Nufarm site. This year Nufarm 
conducted 80 plant tours for 
members of the local community.
The program has resulted in better 
engagement with the community  
and a better understanding of  
what Nufarm does. Nufarm is now recognised for making a positive contribution to the local community. 
Nufarm Brazil was honoured with  
the award at the Empresas Mais  – Brazil (Companies Plus Award),  in the category of ‘Best Company, 
Chemical and Petrochemical’. The 
awards were assessed on performance  
in the areas of economic performance, sustainability and also corporate 
governance initiatives.
