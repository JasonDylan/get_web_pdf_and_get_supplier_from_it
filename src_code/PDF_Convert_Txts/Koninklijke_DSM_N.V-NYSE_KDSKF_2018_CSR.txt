Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  6 www.dsm.comDear reader,
The year 2018 was a very successful year for our company in
almost every way. The hard work and engagement of our
employees delivered very strong results of which we can all be
justly proud.
Strategy 2018 successfully delivered
Delivery and growth
2018 was an excellent year for DSM in which we delivered
again well ahead of our strategic targets, creating significant
value in all our businesses. Even when we exclude the benefits
from a temporary vitamin effect (due to supply disruptions in
the industry), giving us an estimated one-time additional
Adjusted EBITDA of € 290 million, we still had again a record
2018 in which we delivered strong organic growth with a
significant step-up in profitability. For the so-called 'underlying
business' (excluding this temporary vitamin effect), organic
growth was 6%, clearly above market, and Adjusted EBITDA
was more than € 1.5 billion, being a 6% increase (in fact just
over 10% when excluding the negative currency effect) versus
last year. The ROCE of underlying business, was 13.3%, up
100 basis points compared to last year and the total net profit
was € 1,079 million. Our total sales (including the temporary
vitamin effect) increased by 7% to more than € 9 billion with
11% organic growth. Total Adjusted EBITDA was more than
€ 1.8 billion, up 26%.
With this record year, we completed a very successful three-
year period in which we clearly outperformed on our strategic
targets as set in Strategy 2018. We stepped up our organic
growth rate, our profitability and our financial returns, while
simultaneously delivering on our ambitious sustainability
targets. Strategy 2018 has been a great success, through
which we have created a strong platform to drive continued
above-market growth and deliver further improvements in
profitability and returns.
Both our Nutrition and Materials businesses contributed to this
strong performance. Nutrition's broad, global portfolio in food
and feed ingredients, as well as its expanded portfolio of
solutions (including premixes and forms), drove strong growth.
This enabled us to invest in the future – for example via new
nutrition facilities in Poland and India. We were also pleased
to announce a global partnership with Mixfit for personalized
nutrition. Meanwhile, Materials continued its 'silent
transformation', successfully focusing on higher-growth,
higher-margin, specialty segments and delivering higher-
performing solutions that are innovative, safe and lightweight,
as well as being more sustainable and environmentally friendly.
We are investing for the time ahead here as well — an example
is the investment in global Dyneema® production capacity,
and the introduction of Akulon® RePurposed, a polyamide 6
made from recycled fishing nets. In addition, we are investing
in major innovation projects in Nutrition as well as Materials.
We feature many examples of these innovations throughout
this Letter and Report.As a global company, we are well represented in all major
growth areas of the world: 43% of our total sales are from high-
growth economies, in line with our stated ambition for a
balanced global presence. The execution of extensive cost-
reduction and improvement programs delivered run-rate
cumulative savings of approximately € 275 million versus the
2014 baseline by the end of 2018. Consistent improvements
in capital efficiency were achieved in 2018, with ROCE today
at 13.3% (underlying business; as much as 16.8% including
the temporary vitamin effect), almost doubling from 7.6% in
2015.
Acting on our commitment to monetize our remaining Pharma
and Bulk Chemicals joint ventures, we divested our non-core
participating interests in DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals and
Fibrant in October 2018. Together with our cash generation,
this all led to a net debt reduction in 2018 of € 629 million to
€ 113 million at year-end. We plan to divest our remaining
minority shares in AOC Aliancys (18.9%) and AnQore (35%) at
the right moment in the coming period. Since 2015, we have
monetized our non-core joint ventures in pharma (especially
Patheon) and Fibre Intermediates for a total of about €  3 billion,
providing the company with a strong financial position and
balance sheet. For more information on our full financial
performance, see 'Profit' on page 58.
Science and innovation
We are leveraging our unique technology capabilities to
develop innovative, sustainable solutions. In 2018, we
invested 4.5% of sales in R&D and created a strong and
refocused innovation pipeline to drive long-term growth.
Consequently in 2018, 19% of our sales came from
innovations introduced in the last five years, achieving our
aspiration of around 20%.
We made good progress on our large innovation projects. The
construction of our new USD 200 million facility which will
produce the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA from natural
marine algae for our Veramaris® joint venture with Evonik is on
time and progressing according to plan. We are also preparing
for regulatory approval in various markets for our Project Clean
Cow, our new innovative feed solution that delivers a more
than 30% reduction in emissions of the greenhouse gas
methane from cattle. With our fermentative Stevia, now a
50:50 joint venture with Cargill, we bring zero-calorie, cost-
effective sweeteners to market faster by combining our
respective proprietary technologies. We also successfully
launched a new proprietary yeast, as well as an enzyme
cocktail, for the production of bio-ethanol from agricultural
residues. Our solar business also provides an alternative for
fossil resources, through our anti-reflective coatings, which
boost solar panel yields, and our endurance backsheets for
solar panels, which are fully recyclable and have a lower CO 2
footprint than fluorinated backsheets. Another example is a
new enzyme for broilers that facilitates digestion, supports
better health, and permits the use of less feed. We made greatLetter from the CEO
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  7 www.dsm.comsteps with Niaga®, our fully circular carpet project for
preventing carpets from ending up in landfill or being
incinerated. We are now even applying this design philosophy
more broadly to categories beyond carpet: DSM-Niaga
together with Royal Auping achieved a breakthrough in the
creation of fully recyclable mattresses.
Sustainability and business
At DSM, sustainability is not only our core value and a key
responsibility; it is also increasingly an important business
driver that is fully engrained in our strategy, business and
operations. Our approach for bringing about positive change
is to improve, enable and advocate.
Improve  is all about the impact of our own operations. In 2018,
we continued our sustainable approach to our own
operations. We apply an internal carbon price of € 50 per ton
of CO 2 to help guide our investments and operational
decisions and are making good progress in reducing our own
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our GHG efficiency
improved from 26% in 2017 to 33% in 2018 versus our 2008
baseline, strongly outperforming our aspirations. Also, in
absolute terms our emissions fell by more than 8% in 2018.
Last year 41% of our purchased electricity came from
renewable resources, compared with 21% the year before,
which puts us on track to achieve 75% in 2030. In addition to
this our energy efficiency improved by 1.4% year-on-year,
compared with a 1% average annual target.
Not only do we work hard to improve  our own operations; we
also enable  our customers to do the same with our innovative
solutions. We ensure that the solutions we offer are better for
people and/or the planet than existing offerings. In 2018, 62%
of our sales came from products that have a better
environmental (ECO+) and/or social (People+) impact than
mainstream solutions. We call these our Brighter Living
Solutions. Our innovative solutions are applied within three
domains: Nutrition & Health, Climate & Energy and Resources
& Circularity. They include our Project Clean Cow,
Veramaris®, fermentative Stevia, Niaga®, light-weight
materials and green energy projects in solar and bio-based,
which enable our customers and the entire value chain to be
more sustainable. We took further steps to tackle malnutrition.
More than a decade ago, we entered into our partnership with
the UN World Food Programme (WFP). We extended this for
another three years in 2018, and today reach over 39 million
people worldwide annually with essential nutrients. We have
now decided to also address nutrient deficiency among at-risk
populations by means of local initiatives, for example, through
our Africa Improved Foods (AIF) project we started in Rwanda,
where together with partners we are working hard to address
the issue of malnutrition and stunting by using local sourcing
and production.
We continue to  advocate on issues that define our times and
can be addressed by our competences. Malnutrition, Climateand Circularity are therefore the most important issues we
address. Among others by our advocacy to address hunger
and malnutrition, via the UN, WFP, UNICEF, but also via the
Scaling Up Nutrition Global Business Network that we helped
to establish, composed of over 400 national and international
companies scaling up programs to address malnutrition
globally. We were again a positive voice with our participation
in organizations such as the World Economic Forum, the
Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC, convened by the
World Bank and supported by the UN, IMF and OECD), the
Corporate Leadership Group, and We Mean Business. We
continued our support for the UN Global Compact in 2018 and
remain committed to reporting our progress toward this
initiative.
We are proud to be recognized as a constructive contributor
to a changing world, achieving this by working side by side
with governments, industry bodies and peers. We were
recognized for the contributions we made during 2018. To
mention only a few: we featured in the Fortune Magazine's
2018 'Change the World' list for the third consecutive year. I
myself was humbled and honored to be named among
World's 50 Greatest Leaders by Fortune Magazine. We were
part of Forbes' best employer list globally. Our company was
also among the winners of the Ethical Corporation 2018
Responsible Business Awards. We were pleased to be again
ranked number one globally by Sustainalytics and we topped
the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the eighth time.
Our people and leadership
The organizational adjustments of the past strategic period
have enabled us to develop a stronger, more diverse, results-
oriented company and culture. The brainpower, willpower and
passion of our employees, who say with pride that working at
DSM is about Doing Something Meaningful, have made this
happen. Our people feel even more inspired, engaged and
committed: our annual Employee Engagement Index rating
increased from 75% in 2017 to a highest-ever score of 76%
in 2018. Almost all elements of our Employee Engagement
showed improvement. The most notable increases were seen
in career opportunities and opportunities for learning and
development.
We continued to focus on improving our performance in
inclusion and diversity. Although our work in this area is far
from done, it is pleasing to see that today, more nationalities
than before are represented across our company, and there
is also a better gender balance at management and executive
levels, as well as among their direct reports. The same goes
for our Supervisory Board. Going into 2019, the percentage of
women in our Executive Committee as well as our Supervisory
Board is 43%, both meeting the target of 30% prescribed by
Dutch legislation in terms of gender balance. Also, the
Supervisory Board of DSM Nederland B.V., a subsidiary of
Royal DSM, meets the gender balance target (33% female). All
these boards have helped us to set the right course, with an
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  8 www.dsm.cominnovative mindset, to deliver on our strategic, financial and
societal promises. I would like to warmly thank Tom de Swaan,
who retired from the Supervisory Board in 2018, for the
significant contribution he has made over the course of so
many years.
We worked on further improving our safety performance in
2018. We focused on keeping safety awareness high and we
developed a new set of global performance indicators to help
us more proactively tackle safety observations and prevent
incidents from occurring. However, in September 2018, a
tragic accident took place at our Tortuga site in Pecém, Brazil,
where one of our subcontractors lost his life when opening a
container. This has deeply shocked us all. It demonstrates
once again that Health and Safety must always remain our top
priority, and that we must work to continuously improve our
safety performance, day in, day out. 
Purpose-led and ideally positioned for growth
We have very successfully implemented our Strategy 2018
and with that made again important steps to transform DSM
and future-proof our company. We have built strong
businesses. We have become a growth company with
ambitious sustainability efforts that creates value for all
stakeholders across the three dimensions of People, Planet
and Profit. Over the last decade, we have made decisive steps
as a performance-driven and purpose-led company that
creates brighter lives for all  with science-based solutions that
help build a brighter world for our customers, employees,
shareholders and society at large, for people today and
generations to come. Ten years ago, many people believed
that contributing to a better and a more sustainable world
could not go hand in hand with financial returns and profit.
Today, we are proving that doing well financially can go
together with doing good for the world. We are convinced this
will only become more important in the future. Within the next
ten years, good financial results will have to go hand in hand
with purpose, providing companies with their continued
license to operate in a broad sense. We currently see a
growing belief among our shareholders confirming this view.
Strategy 2021
Our purpose is fully anchored in our strategy. It drives our
performance and sets the scope for our growth, financial
returns and the evolution of our portfolio. In June 2018, we
presented our strategy update, detailing how we will evolve
further toward being a purpose-led, science-based company
active in Nutrition, Health and Sustainable Living. We will focus
on strong platforms for growth, centered on developing
innovative solutions addressing Nutrition & Health, Climate &
Energy, and Resources & Circularity. Increased customer-
centricity and large innovation projects will enable above-
market growth. At the same time, we will remain focused on
cost control and operational excellence, allowing us toaccelerate profit and cash generation. Organic growth will be
complemented by acquisitions, predominantly in Nutrition.
We have set two headline financial targets for the period
2019–2021: (1) High single-digit annual percentage increase
in Adjusted EBITDA; and (2) ~10% average annual increase in
Adjusted net operating free cash flow. We are also stepping
up our ambitions regarding the reduction of GHG emissions,
increased energy efficiency and increased use of renewable
energy.
What's next
We are well placed to move forward and to deliver on our 2021
strategic targets, to drive continued above-market organic
growth and deliver further improvements in profitability, returns
and sustainability. Working together with our stakeholders, we
will create a brighter future. I am truly excited about what we
have realized already and can achieve together. On behalf of
the Managing Board, I would like to thank everyone who
helped make 2018 a great year for DSM: our customers, our
business partners, our shareholders, our people, and my
colleagues in the Executive Committee, as well as the
Supervisory Board.

In 2016, the United Nations launched the Global Goals for Sustainable Development (SDGs), a roadmap to a more environmentally and 
socially conscious and responsible world by 2030. At DSM, we believe that companies have a key role to play in achieving the SDGs. 
We believe that our combination of Health, Nutrition and Sustainable Living contributes in a positive way toward achieving the SDGs.
Our purpose aligns most closely with fi  ve of the SDGs, and we show here some examples of our contributions and commitments 
toward these core SDGs. In addition, we believe that we can contribute to the other SDGs. Information about our engagements can 
be found throughout this Report, as well as in the Sustainability Statements.DSM and the

Toward measuring 
impact on the SDGs
The Chemical Sector SDG Roadmap
We joined the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development’s Chemical Sector SDG Roadmap working 
group in 2018. In July, this group published a Roadmap that 
deﬁ  nes the key impact opportunities where the sector can 
make the most meaningful contribution to the material SDGs 
and SDG targets of the sector. Importantly, it recognizes the 
potential for both positive and negative impact on the SDGs.
We support the Roadmap’s invitation to the chemical 
industry to collaborate around eﬀ  orts to achieve SDG action.
De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) working group on SDG 
Impact Measurement
We were invited to join the DNB working group on SDG 
Impact Measurement. This working group brings together 
a number of Dutch investors, the Global Reporting Initiative 
and invited companies to deﬁ  ne standardized positive SDG 
impact indicators.
“We are convinced that companies will increasingly be held 
responsible for the societal impact of the products and 
services that they sell. Consequently, the ability to accurately 
measure impact will only become more important for all 
companies and we promote all eﬀ  orts aimed at that goal. As 
investors we need reliable impact data to report to our own 
stakeholders,” states Felix Lanters, Head of Equities, PGGM.
“We are proud that PGGM is part of the Nederlandsche 
Bank’s working group on SDG Impact Measurement and 
we are pleased that DSM, a purpose-led company that 
already has impact, has accepted the invitation to share their 
journey.”
UBS Impact Measurement for Listed Equities
Together with Harvard University (Massachusetts, USA), 
City University of New York (New York, USA) and University 
of Wageningen (Netherlands), this initiative has the goal 
of deﬁ  ning impact measurement, through products and 
services, that cover the impact categories of Climate change 
and air pollution, Water scarcity, Food security and Health 
care, aligned to the SDGs. We are working together with 
Harvard University to reﬁ  ne the impact category on Food 
security.We contribute through…
... materials that enable a circular economy, such as 
Niaga®, Akulon® RePurposed and EcoPaXX®.
… supporting the food system through our joint venture, 
Veramaris®, which replaces wild caught fi  sh in fi  sh feed 
for aquaculture, and by reducing food waste through 
packaging and preservation solutions.
…our waterborne resins that have lower VOC emissions.
… our biofuel solutions, which enable fuel production from 
biomass from agricultural residues.
… working with advocacy partners to scale up circular 
economy solutions, reduce food waste and promote 
the role of renewable raw materials. 
Our commitments
• ‘Safe by design’ is the leading principle in the 
development of new and better products and 
processes
• 80‒90% of our waste will be recycled by 2020
• We will improve our air emissions eﬃ   ciency by 40% by 
2020 (vs. 2015)

capturing the full potential of our new business portfolio after the extensive transformation that occurred in the period 2010–2015
and translating this into strong financial results.
Strategy 2018 had two headline financial targets: high single-digit percentage annual Adjusted EBITDA growth and high double-
digit basis point annual ROCE growth.

Philip Eykerman, DSM Executive Committee
We successfully executed our strategy. With a very strong
2018, we have outperformed our ambitious financial and
sustainability targets. We delivered strong organic growth,
with greatly improved operational and financial performance
and with significant value creation in all our businesses. In
addition, we took important steps to monetize our non-core
Pharma and Bulk Chemicals joint ventures. Even considering
the additional profitability in the Nutrition business driven by an
exceptional temporary vitamin effect, 2018 was a strong year.For the strategic period 2016–2018, we:
- Outperformed on our financial targets on Adjusted EBITDA
growth and ROCE growth
- Outpaced market growth in both Nutrition and Materials
- Created a strong and focused innovation pipeline to
enhance long-term growth
- Executed extensive cost-reduction and improvement
programs which delivered run-rate cumulative savings of
~€ 275 million at the end of 2018 versus the 2014 baseline
- Achieved improvements in capital efficiency
- Extracted significant value from our joint venture
partnerships Patheon, ChemicaInvest and DSM Sinochem
Pharmaceuticals. The combined proceeds of these
divestments were around € 3 billion. We plan to divest our
remaining minority shares in AOC Aliancys (18.9%) and
AnQore (35%) in the coming period

our commitment to sustainability by:
- Reducing our own environmental footprint
- Enabling other stakeholders, especially our customers, to
be more sustainable
- Advocating on key areas of competence by actively raising
awareness and sharing knowledge
By doing so, we continued to work toward the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG 2 (Zero
Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 7
(Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 12 (Responsible
Production and Consumption) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

Development Goals' on page 10 and throughout this Report.
During the execution of our Strategy 2018, we continually
monitored, assessed and responded appropriately to societal,
macroeconomic and segment-specific developments as they
occurred. Our approach to managing both opportunities and
risks in our businesses is embedded in our operating and
governance model and risk management approach. For more
information, see 'Corporate governance' on page 108 and

Strategy 2018 successfully delivered
Total DSM financial results
We significantly outperformed our financial targets in 2018.
Even considering the estimated impact of the temporary
vitamin effect, caused by an extraordinary supply disruption in
the industry, we have delivered strong results. In the underlying
business1, we achieved 6% organic growth compared to
1Excluding temporary vitamin effect, see table on page 65.2017, with €  8,852 million in sales. The Adjusted EBITDA from
underlying business was up 6% from 2017, to €  1,532 million.
Adjusted for currencies, our growth was 10%, above our high
single-digit percentage target. Our Return On Capital
Employed (ROCE) from underlying business was up 100 basis
points, to 13.3%, versus our target of high double-digit basis
points. 
Including the estimated temporary vitamin effect, we realized
€ 9,267 million in sales compared to €  8,632 million in 2017, a
7% increase. We achieved a 26% total Adjusted EBITDA
growth, up to €  1,822 million from €  1,445 million in 2017. Our
ROCE was 16.8%, up 450 basis points from the previous year.
Net profit was € 1,079 million.
Over the strategic period 2016–2018, we consistently
outperformed our targets. We realized an average Adjusted
EBITDA growth of 13% against an average high single-digit
percentage yearly target. The same goes for the average high
double-digit basis point ROCE growth, which was 190 basis
points per year over the period 2016–2018.
In 2018, we delivered strong organic growth, with greatly
improved operational and financial performance and
significant value creation in all our businesses. Both our
Nutrition and Materials businesses contributed to this strong
performance. Nutrition's broad, global portfolio in food and
feed ingredients, as well as its expanded portfolio of solutions,
drove strong growth. Meanwhile, Materials continued its 'silent
transformation', successfully focusing on higher-growth,
higher-margin, specialty segments and delivering higher-
performing solutions that are innovative, safe and lightweight,
as well as being more sustainable and environmentally friendly.

Nutrition financial results
Our Nutrition business performed strongly, benefiting from a
temporary exceptional vitamin effect caused by supply
disruptions in the industry. The total temporary vitamin effect
was estimated at € 415 million for the year, mainly in Animal
Nutrition & Health. Sales in the underlying business were up
3% to € 5,722 million. The organic sales growth in the
underlying business was 7%, with strong volumes, up 4%, as
well as price growth of 3%. Nutrition sales growth including
temporary vitamin effect, was 10%. 
Nutrition continued to deliver on its aspired above-market
growth ambition through further leveraging its unique global
products and local solutions business model, supported by
marketing and sales excellence and customer-led innovation.
Animal Nutrition & Health delivered a strong year, with 8%
organic growth in the underlying business versus 2017. This
good growth was achieved against a tough comparative year.
Business conditions were favorable in almost all regions. Sales
to Brazil were softer due to temporary shutdowns, mainly
caused by strikes in the second quarter. Prices in theunderlying business increased by 4%, driven by pricing
initiatives to mitigate higher costs of sourced ingredients and
the impact of negative exchange rates. Furthermore, prices
were supported by the effects of the 'Blue Skies' policies in
China. 
Our Animal Nutrition & Health business continued to benefit
from our ability to address a wide range of species, as well as
from a diversified geographical presence. Markets in animal
feed were favorable, with strong demand for poultry, pork and
salmon.
Human Nutrition & Health delivered a strong year, with 7%
organic growth and 4% volume growth. All regions and
segments continued to perform well with an especially strong
growth in dietary supplements, i-Health and the pharma
segment. Early life nutrition showed solid performance in all
regions. Construction started on our second premix solutions
facility in Poland, which will be exclusively dedicated to the
maternal and infant nutrition market. Sales to food &
beverages continued to develop well, driven by tailored
multiple-ingredient premix solutions, and supported by
marketing & sales excellence and local application know-how.
Prices were up by 3%, driven by a combination of a favorable
mix due to strong growth in premix and i-Health, as well as
benefits from higher prices for premix and advanced
formulations, supported by the effects of the 'Blue Skies'
policies in China.
In Food Specialties, sales were 9% lower compared to 2017,
due to the deconsolidation of Yantai Andre Pectin and
negative currency effects. Good sales growth rates in
hydrocolloids, enzymes and cultures were partly offset by soft
sales in savory ingredients as a result of capacity limitations
early in the year that prevented the business from fully
capitalizing on the positive market conditions. This resulted in
an overall organic growth of 1%.Report by the Managing Board — Strategy 2018
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  15 www.dsm.comAfter a successful initial market introduction in North America
in mid-2018, we accelerated our large innovation project for
fermentative Stevia by establishing a joint venture with Cargill,
as announced last November. Stevia is a zero-calorie, cost-
effective sweetener that can substitute sugar in food and
beverages.
In Personal Care & Aroma Ingredients, sales were up 8%, with
a very strong 11% organic growth, partly offset by 3% less
favorable currencies. All personal care product lines, including
sun, skin and hair care delivered good above-market growth,
whereas aroma ingredients performed very strongly in 2018.
Successful commercialization of the innovation pipeline further
contributed to a very good year for the business.
For Nutrition, the Adjusted EBITDA growth in the underlying
business was up 6% to € 1,117 million compared to the
previous year. This was driven by strong volume growth,
pricing strength, and contributions from the savings and
efficiency improvement programs, partly offset by significant
negative foreign exchange effects. The Adjusted EBITDA
margin in the underlying business was 19.5%, compared to
18.9% in 2017. The Adjusted EBITDA for total Nutrition was
€ 1,407 million, up 34% from the previous year, including the
estimated total temporary vitamin effect of € 290 million,
mainly in Animal Nutrition & Health. The Adjusted EBITDA
margin for total Nutrition was 22.9% in 2018, compared to
18.9% in 2017. Over the strategic period, the Adjusted
EBITDA was consistently over our aspired range of 18–20%.
Materials financial results
In 2018, our Materials business reported 5% organic sales
growth, driven by an increase of 2% in volumes and 3% in
prices, mainly reflecting commercial pricing initiatives aimed at
offsetting higher raw material costs.
DSM Engineering Plastics and DSM Resins & Functional
materials delivered 7% and 2% organic growth respectively.
The good business conditions and strong end-market
demand started to soften in the second half of the year, with
some destocking in the value chain at year-end. DSM
Dyneema had a very strong performance throughout 2018,
with 6% organic growth, driven by continued high demand in
personal protection. To fulfill the growing demand, the
business started constructing additional production lines in the
USA and in the Netherlands.
Total Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% in 2018 to € 512 million,
driven by good volume growth and our continuous shift toward
a specialty portfolio, and despite a negative currency impact
of 2%. The portfolio's silent transformation was also reflected
in the 2018 Adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.6%, versus 17.3%
in 2017.Innovation results
The DSM Innovation Center has multiple functions within
DSM, including accelerating the innovation power of our core
businesses and extracting value from our Emerging Business
Areas (EBAs). At DSM, we want at least ~20% of our sales to
come from innovation sales, which we define as sales from
products and solutions introduced in the last five years. In
2018, innovation sales (underlying business) amounted to
19%. This is in line with our aspiration.
DSM Innovation Center sales were up 2%, with 5% organic
sales growth largely offset by a weaker US dollar. DSM
Biomedical volumes were up driven by strong sales in the drug
delivery segment in the second half of the year. DSM
Advanced Solar reported slightly lower volumes resulting from
a slowdown in demand for solar panels following a policy
change by the Chinese government to reduce the number of
subsidized solar parks to be installed. DSM Advanced Solar
introduced a new generation of solar backsheets which is
being well received by the market. DSM Bio-based Products
& Services made good progress in 2018, improving the
robustness of the production technology for second-
generation bio-ethanol and introducing a new generation of
enzymes for first-generation bio-ethanol.
The Adjusted EBITDA was relatively stable compared to 2017.
In the fourth quarter, we benefited from the collaboration and
license agreement with Aerie Pharmaceuticals.

Balanced global footprint
Sales growth was strong among all regions, with favorable
high double-digit growth in Western Europe and single-digit
growth in North and Latin America. Sales were good in Latin
America and China, despite some temporary shutdowns in
Brazil. Solid growth was achieved in China, India and Eastern
Europe. All high-growth economies together currently
represent 43% of our sales, which is in line with 2017. The
share of sales in these economies as a proportion of our total
sales gives us a well-balanced global footprint.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  16 www.dsm.comSustainability results
At DSM, sustainability is not only our core value and a key
responsibility; it is also increasingly an important business
driver that is fully engrained in our strategy, business and
operations. Our approach for bringing about positive change
is to reduce, enable and advocate.
We continued to further embed sustainability across all of our
business activities, both in recognition of our responsibility to
reduce our environmental footprint and to help our supply
chain, customers and partners do the same. In particular, we
focused on the areas of nutrition, climate and energy, and the
circular and bio-based economy. In 2018, our Brighter Living
Solutions accounted for 62%2 of sales (from underlying
business). We are proud to be globally recognized for our
leadership in this area. We are pleased to be named as the
global leader in ESG (environmental, social and governance)
within the chemicals industry by Sustainalytics for the second
year in a row. We ranked number one of 135 companies. Our
climate change strategy received an A- rating from CDP, the
non-profit global environmental disclosure platform. We also
maintained our high AA rating from MSCI. In addition, we
topped the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the
eighth time. This ranking means we will continue to have
RobecoSAM Gold Class status in 2019.
To read more about our environmental performance, see
'Planet' on page 52.
Organization and culture
We adjusted our global organizational and operating model to
support our growth. To achieve our strategy, we set targets
around employee safety, engagement and diversity.
Our people feel even more inspired, engaged and committed:
our annual Employee Engagement Index rating increased from
75% in 2017 to a highest-ever score of 76% in 2018. Almost
all elements of our Employee Engagement showed
improvement. The most notable increases were seen in career
opportunities and opportunities for learning and development.
We continued to focus on improving our performance in
inclusion and diversity. Although our work in this area is far
from done, it is pleasing to see that the percentage of female
executives increased from 17% to 19%, making progress
toward 25% by 2020. The number of under-represented
nationalities at executive level increased to 60%, achieving our
long-term aim of 60%. For more information, see 'People' on
page 42.
We worked on further improving our safety performance in
2018. We focused on keeping safety awareness high and we
developed a new set of global leading performance indicators
to help us to more proactively tackle safety observations and

DSM Recordable Injuries improved from 0.36 to 0.33.
However, in September 2018, a tragic accident took place at
our Tortuga site in Pecém, Brazil, where one of our
subcontractors lost his life when opening a container. This has
deeply shocked us all. It demonstrates once again that Health
and Safety must always remain our top priority, and that we
must work to continuously improve our safety performance,
day in, day out. For more information, see 'What still went
wrong in 2018' on page 138.
Extracting value from our partnerships
Acting on our commitment to monetize our remaining Pharma
and Bulk Chemicals joint ventures, we divested our non-core
participations in DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals and Fibrant
in October 2018. Together with our cash generation, this all
led to a net debt reduction in 2018 from € 742 million to
€ 113 million at year-end. We plan to divest our remaining
minority shares in AOC Aliancys (18.9%) and AnQore (35%) in
the coming period. Since 2015, we have monetized our non-
core joint ventures in pharma (especially Patheon) and Fibre
Intermediates for a total of about € 3 billion. For more
information, see 'Partnerships' on page 104.
Strategy review process for the period beyond 2018
In 2018, having achieved EBITDA growth rates and
improvements in return on capital employed above the original
targets and having made good progress with innovation, cost
reduction and efficiency programs at business level, as well as
with monetizing our non-core assets, we brought forward our
regular strategy review process. In June 2018, we launched
Strategy 2021: Growth & Value - Purpose led, Performance

The next step for DSM: a purpose-led company
For more than a decade, we have distinguished ourselves by
embracing sustainability and providing value for all our
stakeholders across the three dimensions of People, Planet
and Profit. Now we are taking a decisive next step as a
purpose-led company, contributing to a brighter world for all
with our science-based solutions.
Ten years ago, the general belief was that, as a company, you
focused either on profit or on improving the world, but that you
could not do both. Today, we see more and more companies,
like ourselves, proving that doing well financially can go
together with doing well for the world. This will only become
more important. Within the next 10 years, good financial
results will have to go hand in hand with purpose, otherwise
companies will lose their license to operate. Our purpose is
therefore fully anchored in our Strategy 2021: Growth & Value
- Purpose led, Performance driven.

possible, within the constraints of the world's resources. We
aim to redefine how we live and work in order to create a fairer,
more prosperous, and more sustainable society.
Businesses need to balance the need to generate profitable
growth with the need to play a positive role in the world.
Ultimately, we aspire to be a company for all, creating value
for all our stakeholders — customers, employees,
shareholders, and society at large — and building a stronger
legacy and brighter future for generations to come. This is
important because:
-Customers prefer to work with suppliers who share their
values
-Employees seek meaning in their work and increasingly
want to make a positive contribution-Shareholders prefer to invest in companies that
demonstrate beneficial social and/or environmental impact
alongside a solid financial return
-Society at large ultimately determines our license to operate
By ensuring that these objectives go hand in hand, we will be
more appealing to investors, attract the best talent and the
most innovative customers, and build the right relationships
with partners and governments around the world.
We are sharpening our focus and connecting our purpose,
strategy and culture in order to inspire all our people and
stakeholders to achieve more together. We are further evolving
into a purpose-led, science-based company in Nutrition,
Health and Sustainable Living.
Acting on our purpose
We make change happen in three ways: 
Improve : we improve and adapt our own operational impact
by further improving safety, decreasing our emissions and
stepping up our use of renewable energy
Enable:  we enable our customers and partners to deliver
sustainable and healthy solutions for the planet and society
Advocate : we advocate for the future we believe in and fully
accept our responsibilities as a member of society
We recognize the increased scale and impact of private
companies in the global economy. Therefore, we take an
integrated approach to our responsibilities. Our Brighter Living
Agenda brings together many existing purpose-led initiatives
and creates an actionable framework for further engagement
with our stakeholders.

Purpose sets scope for further growth and evolution
With Strategy 2021: Growth & Value - Purpose led,
Performance driven , we will evolve further toward being a
purpose-led, science-based company operating in the fields
of Nutrition, Health and Sustainable Living. Our strong growth
platform, centered on developing innovative solutions
addressing Nutrition & Health, Climate & Energy and
Resources & Circularity, together with increased customer-
centricity and our large innovation projects, will drive above-
market growth. At the same time, we will remain focused on
cost control and operational excellence, allowing us to
accelerate profit growth and cash generation. Organic growth
will be complemented by acquisitions, predominantly in
Nutrition.
Our Nutrition business will focus on human nutrition
(ingredients and solutions for food & beverages, as well as
specialty nutrition, nutritional ingredients, consumer-branded
products and personalized nutrition), animal nutrition (with
premix and specialty solutions), and personal care and aroma
ingredients.
Our Materials business will further develop as a high-growth,
higher-margin specialty business, and will focus on the
categories Improved Health & Living, Green Products &
Applications, and New Mobility & Connectivity.
By improving the impact of our own operations, enabling
sustainable solutions for our customers, and advocating
sustainable business, we can grow faster and reduce our costand risk profile. We will further step up our ambitions regarding
the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in line with the
Paris Agreement, our energy efficiency and our use of
renewable energy.
Performance to deliver growth and value
We have set two ambitious targets for profit growth and cash
generation to drive value creation for the period 2019-2021:
- A high single-digit annual percentage increase in Adjusted
EBITDA
- An average annual increase of about 10% in Adjusted net
operating free cash flow
We are committed to top-line growth ahead of market, which
will be supported by expanded solution offerings that place
the customer even more firmly in the center of our activities,
as well as by harnessing digital capabilities to increase
customer intimacy, improve productivity and efficiency, and
support new business models. Approximately 45% of sales
will come from high-growth economies.
We will leverage our unique technology capabilities to develop
innovative sustainable solutions in Nutrition & Health, Climate
& Energy and Resources & Circularity and will invest
approximately 5% of sales in R&D to develop differentiating
science and technology. Our innovation projects, including
Veramaris®, Project Clean Cow, fermentative Stevia and
Niaga®, will result in about 20% of sales coming from
innovation.

11 1
Greater efficiencies and a heightened focus on higher-margin
specialty solutions will enable new Adjusted EBITDA margin
ambitions by 2021 for Nutrition (over 20%) and Materials
(18–20%). Organic top-line growth combined with these
enhanced margins will drive high single-digit Adjusted EBITDA
growth.
We aim to accelerate growth in Adjusted net operating free
cash flow, generating an average annual increase of
approximately 10%. This results from the ambition to:
- Reduce working capital levels by around 50 basis points
annually
-Take a disciplined approach to capital expenditure, with an
overall level of spend of approximately 6.5% of sales
-Drive improvements in organic Return on Capital Employed
(ROCE) of around 1% annually
Our overall deployment of capital is expected to drive Adjusted
Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth ahead of Adjusted EBITDA
growth. Our cash allocation policy remains unchanged and
has a clear order of priority for cash deployment:
- Disciplined capital expenditure for organic growth: about
6.5% of annual sales
- A stable, preferably rising dividend
- Disciplined M&A, predominantly in Nutrition
-In the absence of value-creating M&A, capital to be returned
to shareholders
We remain committed to maintaining a strong, investment-
grade credit rating.While keeping our policy of a stable, and preferably rising,
dividend unchanged, we propose a dividend increase of about
25% to € 2.30 per ordinary share over 2018, as already
reflected in the interim dividend over 2018 paid in August
2018. This step-up in dividend is linked to the earnings growth
of the underlying business. In line with the targets set for the
period 2019–2021, our performance is expected to result in
further dividend growth, which could lead to an expected
average payout of 40–50% of adjusted earnings.
We will target M&A predominantly in Nutrition, given its unique
growth potential, resilience, strong leadership position and
potential for value creation.
Nutrition
We have built a unique, highly integrated, global and broad
portfolio in food & beverage, specialty food and feed, and
nutritional ingredients and solutions, meeting local needs
through our unparalleled network. We possess a diverse and
significant premix footprint, with superior formulations and
delivery systems, helping to drive sustainable nutritional
solutions. This infrastructure is fueled by our complete portfolio
of nutritional ingredients, which includes minerals, vitamins,
nutritional lipids, eubiotics, enzymes and yeasts, as well as
texturants, flavors and cultures. This diversity and level of
integration creates a resilient portfolio with limited exposure to
single products or customers, while benefiting from the
opportunities provided by global megatrends.Report by the Managing Board — Strategy 2021

+Focused on Nutrition & Health, we will continue to aim for
above-market growth with targeted, high single-digit Adjusted
EBITDA growth and an Adjusted EBITDA margin greater than
20% by 2021. We will complement organic growth with
inorganic growth. At the same time, we will further build on the
successful initiatives of Strategy 2018, increasingly placing the
customer at the center of everything we do, while delivering
large, sustainability-driven, innovation projects.
Animal Nutrition & Health 
We will continue to seek to deliver above-market sales growth
through our acCElerate program, increased levels of
innovation, and further investment in our business-to-farmer
and go-to-market capabilities. The first phase of acCElerate
began in 2018, as we sought to align our operating model and
organization to deliver the strength of our global capability by
meeting increasingly local demand trends, as well as by
defining new metrics to assess regional performance.
Subsequent phases of this program will focus on:
- Marketing & Sales excellence (especially building specialist
functions to address wider species opportunities and
pursue new health solutions)
- Customer-centricity & agility, to place the customer at the
heart of everything we do, by improving the end-to-end
experience for the customer
- Further investing in our business-to-farmer (e.g. in China)
and go-to-market capabilities
In addition, we will pursue radical innovation for core
sustainability topics, all of which seek to deliver long-term
solutions for the industry with the potential to create significant
value for our company and our customers.Human Nutrition & Health 
Building on the success of the first two parts of the LiftOff!
Program as part of Strategy 2018, we will step up further in
Strategy 2021 with a third phase of LiftOff! to drive above-
market organic growth through:
- Focusing on customer-centricity and agility, seeking to
move closer to the customer by strengthening the value
propositions of our products and services, creating end-to-
end customer experiences, and enhanced innovation and
application capabilities
-Continuing to invest in business-to-consumer to ensure the
growth of i-Health beyond the United States, as well as
business-to-me (the practice of marketing to the individual
based on the desires of that individual) and personalized
nutrition
In addition, we will continue to pursue inorganic opportunities
in food and beverages as well as dietary supplements, to
enhance and complement our already strong market
positions.
Our business is well positioned to benefit from strong trends,
as evidenced by the disruptive value chain shifts we are
witnessing, which are leading to new opportunities in Human
Nutrition & Health.
In food and beverages, we see an increasing number of local
players entering the market in answer to the growing demand
for local, healthy products of natural origin with reduced sugar,
salt and fat. These new players have generally limited
development and production assets and market their
products through social media. Global players are facing the
challenge of reducing costs in order to remain competitive
while innovating their products. This scenario represents a
unique opportunity for us. We offer tailored nutritional solutions
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  24 www.dsm.comto local players through our global presence and our R&D
competences. At the same time, we help global players
reduce their manufacturing and R&D costs with our premix
capabilities, but also provide innovative solutions to replace
sugar, salt and fat. As an example, our joint venture with Cargill
(Avansya) to bring zero-calorie, cost-effective, non-artificial
sweeteners to market faster is well positioned to help food and
beverage producers deliver the products and brands
consumers prefer, with significantly reduced calories.
In specialty nutrition (especially dietary supplements), more
health-conscious and educated consumers are increasingly
seeking more personalized products based on their lifestyle,
diet and genetic make-up, leading to a demand for more
individualized advice, delivery systems and diagnostic tools.
This requires a more integrated offering beyond the supply of
nutritional ingredients alone — one that involves turningscientific know-how into expert advice for the consumer. To
help us meet these needs, we are building on our existing
business-to-business and business-to-consumer strengths in
personalized nutrition and are also acquiring business-to-me
learnings from leading startups such as Mixfit, Tespo and
Biomarker.
Materials
We are further future-proofing our Materials business by
aligning it toward Sustainable Living, in line with our key focus
domains of Climate & Energy and Resources & Circularity. This
will further develop Materials into a high-growth, higher-margin
specialty business, delivering above-market organic growth,
focused on Improved Health & Living, Green Products &
Applications and New Mobility & Connectivity.

are lighter, stronger, more efficient and more sustainable. We
are also increasingly focusing on bio-based, recycled, and fully
recyclable solutions.
In New Mobility & Connectivity, we are targeting materials that
support the transition from fossil fuel to electric automotive
power. We are also addressing the growing need for increased
connectivity between products, devices and applications.Across our businesses, we have intensified our focus on
customer-centricity and have implemented several programs
that focus on creating a positive experience for our customers.
Innovation
Innovation is what transforms our 'Bright Science’ into
'Brighter Living’. We can leverage our unique technology
capabilities for developing innovative sustainable solutions
through possessing a profound understanding of:
- The science behind nutrition, and the capability to develop
new nutritional ingredients with proven health benefits —
supported by our state-of-the-art Biotechnology Center,
providing sustainable alternatives for chemical synthesis, as
well as plant/animal-derived ingredientsReport by the Managing Board — Strategy 2021
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  25 www.dsm.com- Material synthesis and characterization, and the capability
to convert this into Sustainable Living applications —
supported by our state-of-the-art Materials Science Center
The ability to continually deliver innovative and improved
products and solutions to meet our customers’ needs drives
sales growth. Our innovations reflect our commitment to
healthier and more sustainable outcomes and so help drive
the performance of our Brighter Living Solutions portfolio.
Innovation sales have also improved our profitability, delivering
higher margins than the average of our running business. Our
innovation sales, defined as products and applications that
have been introduced over the past five years, accounted for
19% of total sales from underlying business in 2018. We aspire
to maintain a level of around 20% during the new strategy
2019–2021 period, which we consider to be a healthy
proportion in view of the overall balance of our product
portfolio and product life cycles. We will continue to invest in
differentiating science and technology, allocating
approximately 5% of sales in R&D.
Our organic growth will be supported by a number of focused,
large innovation projects — for example, Project Clean Cow,
Veramaris®, fermentative Stevia, enzymes and yeasts for
1.5th and 2nd generation bio-ethanol, Niaga®, Additive
Manufacturing, plant-based proteins, bio-agriculture and
biomedical adhesion barriers (Actamax™). These solutions
are expected to be introduced to the market in the 2019–2025
time-frame. All these innovations seek to meet significant,
global sustainability challenges in Nutrition & Health, Climate
& Energy and Resources & Circularity. Altogether, we expect
these to generate around € 350 million of sales and
€ 100 million of Adjusted EBITDA from 2021 to around
€ 1 billion and € 400 million, respectively, from 2025 onward.
As well as supporting innovation in our core businesses, the
DSM Innovation Center also aims to develop its Emerging
Business Areas (EBAs). These are promising growth platforms
outside the scope of our business groups. They comprise
DSM Biomedical, which focuses on innovative materials for
medical devices; DSM Bio-based Products & Services, which
focuses on clean energy from crop residues as well as bio-
chemicals with enzymes and yeasts for biomass conversion;
and DSM Advanced Solar, which offers yield-boosting
solutions for solar energy.
Enabling programs for accelerated growth
Our enabling programs will underpin and facilitate our
ambitions by focusing on key areas such as performance-driven organization, leadership and people, culture,
digitalization and sustainability leadership across DSM.
Organization, leadership and people, and culture
We continue to develop our organization, leadership and
people, and culture to enable continued performance. In terms
of organization, we are maintaining cost discipline and further
optimizing the support functions. Moreover, we are further
developing a customer-centric organization aligned with
market/customer segments.
Regarding leadership and people, we are accelerating
leadership development for both people and teams, as well as
for effectiveness in growing our businesses. We are also
embedding a global mindset through further
internationalization.
In terms of culture, we introduced The DSM Ways of Working,
which describe a daily mindset that enables everyone in our
company to make a difference. These are described in more
detail in 'People’ on page 43.
Digitization and digitalization
Digitization and digitalization drive our growth and improve our
efficiency on three levels:
- Customer intimacy: improving top-line results by, for
example, customer data analytics, omnichannel apps
providing 24/7 customer experiences, and digital
collaboration tools
- Operational performance: reducing costs by automation
and data analytics to increase productivity in support
functions and manufacturing, optimize operational
processes, and improve safety, quality and plant reliability
- New business models: supporting entrepreneurship and
artificial intelligence. Examples are our partnerships for
digital value propositions and our pilots in the areas of
personalized nutrition and animal feed
Sustainability leadership
Sustainability is not only our core value and a key
responsibility, it is increasingly an important business growth
driver at DSM that is fully engrained in our strategy. We are
stepping up our sustainability aspirations. By improving the
impact of our own operations, enabling sustainable solutions
for our customers and advocating sustainable business, we
can grow faster and reduce our cost and risk profile. This is
integral to our strategy and is detailed in the 'Brighter Living
Agenda' on page 20. For more detail, see 'People' on page
42 and 'Planet' on page 52.

Nutrition 
& Health
The link between nutrition and health has never been 
clearer. For the first time in human history, diet-related non-
communicable diseases have overtaken communicable 
diseases as the primary cause of deaths worldwide.
Malnutrition in its various forms affects more than 30% of the 
world’s population: more than 2.3 billion1 adults and children 
are obese or overweight, more than 800 million2 people go 
to bed hungry, and approximately two billion3 suffer from 
hidden hunger. Our work in Nutrition & Health supports 
healthy living and nutritious diets for all. We work tirelessly to 
provide micronutrients as well as to enable the production 
of sustainably sourced protein in all its forms. We provide 
solutions for early life nutrition, food fortification, dietary 
supplementation and easy-to-use personalized nutrition. 
We are developing innovative new solutions that help to 
reduce sugar, salt and saturated fat in processed foods 
and beverages, such as fermentation-based sweeteners. 
Meanwhile, our work in sustained-release drug delivery 
for eye treatment helps people to live healthier lives, our 
expertise in UV filters helps people to stay safe with sun 
protection, and our Dyneema® materials help protect against 
cut, stab and ballistic threats. We have also enabled China’s 
container industry to make the transition away from VOC-
containing solvents, which were significantly contributing to 
the country’s air pollution problem.With our unique science-based competences, 
we have created a strong platform for growth 
and are ideally positioned to capture the growth 
opportunities offered by the global megatrends and 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a 
particular focus on developing innovative solutions 
addressing Nutrition & Health, Climate & Energy 
and Resources & Circularity.Focus domains

Climate & 
Energy
The stability of the world’s climate is under threat. If the 
potentially devastating effects of irreversible climate change 
are to be avoided, we must dramatically limit greenhouse 
gas emissions by transitioning to renewable energy and 
by adopting low-emission solutions and processes. We 
are enabling the low-carbon economy not just by reducing 
our own emissions but also by developing solutions to 
help customers and consumers to cut theirs. In the field of 
advanced solar, our recyclable backsheet and innovative 
coating technologies increase output from solar panels. 
Together with our partner POET, we are pioneering biofuels 
using corn crop residue – a renewable alternative to fossil 
fuels. In animal nutrition, our innovative Project Clean Cow 
will help to cut emissions of the greenhouse gas methane 
from cattle. In transportation, our advanced materials help 
to reduce the weight of cars and thus drive down fuel 
consumption. 
Resources 
& Circularity
The world’s resources are finite, and with a population 
projected to grow to 9.8 billion people by 2050, some 
estimates suggest we will need four planet Earths by then 
to sustain them. New ways of achieving a balance between 
demand and supply have to be found, including approaches 
that are not based on single use and subsequent disposal. 
We are making important contributions to the development 
of an effective circular and bio-based economy founded on 
closed-loop solutions. 
An excellent example of this is our Niaga® technology, which 
allows carpets, mattresses and furnishing products to be 
fully recycled while reducing energy use by approximately 
90% and eliminating the need for water. We use discarded 
fishing nets collected along the coastlines of India as 
the raw material to produce our recycled polyamide 
Akulon® RePurposed. Our Veramaris® joint venture is 
producing an algae-based omega-3 fatty acid solution that 
replaces the need to use caught fish as the basis for fish 
feed, preserving wild fish stocks and making aquaculture 
truly sustainable. Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  30 www.dsm.com

We manufactu re and 
distribute high- quality 
products and services 
safely , efficiently and 
responsibly and strive to 
develop valuable, 
collaborative and 
long-term r elationships 
with customers and 
suppliers. We pursue

We have unique 
competences in life 
sciences and materials 
sciences and connect 
these to deliver innovative 
solutions that nourish, 
protect and impr ove 
performance.This diagram is based on the International Integrated 
Reporting Council’s Integrated Reporting <IR> framework 
and gives an overview of how we create value for our 
stakeholders based on six capital inputs:
• Human capital
• Societal & relationship capital
• Natural capital
• Financial capital
• Intellectual capital
• Manufactured capital
Since 2002, we have reported on our performance in terms 
of People, Planet and Profit, and so the six capitals shown 
here continue to be clustered accordingly.
Our organizational and operating model is made up of 
market-facing business groups focused on the primary 
business functions (Innovation and R&D, Direct Sourcing, 
Manufacturing & Operations, and Marketing & Sales), global 
support and functional excellence departments, and regional 
organizations.
We seek to minimize risk and take advantage of the 
opportunities around megatrends, thereby transforming 
the capital inputs into value and positive impact. A key 
part of our strategy, aside from our financial targets, is to 
continue to strengthen our commitment to sustainability. 
We especially try to have a positive impact through our 
engagement related to the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). We engage with all 17 SDGs, especially on the five 
shown in this figure. For more information, see ‘DSM and the 
Sustainable Development Goals’ on page 10 and throughout 
this Report.Stakeholders
Our purpose can only be realized together with our
stakeholders. Through empowering our employees, engaging
with our customers and suppliers, and with the support of our
investors, we combine doing well financially with doing good
for society. We discuss topics that are relevant to our
operations and our impact on society regularly with our
stakeholders. These conversations shape how we define and
execute our strategy, including risk management, materiality,
and new business opportunities.
Employees
Our employees represent more than 110 nationalities, working
at more than 210 sites and offices in 46 countries worldwide.
We empower our employees to contribute to the success and
growth of our company, and reward and celebrate their
contributions. We aspire to provide an incident- and injury-free
working environment for everyone, including our contractors.
For information on how we engage our employees, see
'People' on page 42.
Customers
Our customers are key stakeholders. They drive our business
and through our collaborations, we enable solutions that help
solve some of the world's biggest problems.

Capital providers play a significant role in the success and
prosperity of our company. They support us in our pursuit of
a long-term oriented strategy which aims to continually create
value for shareholders while offering a low-risk environment for
debt holders.
For more information on how we communicate with investors,
see 'Investors' on page 148 and elsewhere in this Report.Suppliers
Our supply chain consists of more than 35,000 suppliers. Our
suppliers are important partners for achieving our purpose,
and we work closely with them through our Supplier
Sustainability Program.
For more information on how we work with our suppliers,
please see 'Suppliers' on page 146.
Society
We engage with society on many levels. In addition to the
engagements we have with scientific research institutions,
NGOs, local communities and governments, we also engage
in philanthropic events and sponsorship activities.
We collaborate with renowned universities and science
institutes. These engagements include financial support, the
sharing of knowledge, research and facilities, and lectures.
Our work with NGOs and similar organizations contributes to
solutions for the world's societal challenges and helps us to
achieve our purpose.
Engaging with the communities in which we operate is
important for raising awareness about what we are doing, and
how our solutions address societal needs. We engage and
inform our local stakeholders through open days, news
bulletins, social media and other initiatives.
Achieving the SDGs can only be done with the active
participation of and cooperation with governments. We
engage with governments directly as well as through coalitions
and trade associations. As stated in our Code of Business
Conduct, we do not make political donations.
For more information on how we engage with these
stakeholders, see 'Society' on page 148.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  34 www.dsm.comMateriality
In order to assess material topics that are both of interest to
society and have impact on our businesses, we annually
refresh our materiality analysis. In 2018, we performed a light
update of our materiality matrix to reflect any changes in the
relative position of various topics. A more extensive analysis
will be performed in 2019 as part of our new Strategy 2021:
Growth & Value - Purpose led, Performance driven.
Our refresh in 2018 consisted of a survey conducted among
business and functional leaders to capture shifts in societal
interest and business impact. The results were presented and
discussed with the Sustainability Leadership Team. This was
later fine-tuned through interviews with the Executive
Committee. The matrix was compared with the Corporate Risk
Assessment to make sure all relevant topics had been
captured from a materiality and/or risk perspective. Finally, it
was approved by the Managing Board.Changes in 2018
A light refresh was performed in 2018. No new topics were
added to the matrix, and no topics were deleted. The topic
'Emerging economies' has been renamed 'Global footprint'
and 'Resource scarcity / Circular & bio-based economy' has
been renamed 'Resource scarcity / Circular economy'. The
relationship between 'Geopolitical tensions & inequalities' and
'Trade barriers' has been further clarified, with the former
capturing the indirect impact of the latter.
For more information on Materiality, 'Management approach
for material topics' on page 150.

issues, see the company website.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  35 www.dsm.comCollaborative platforms and networks
We collaborate with like-minded peers through platforms and
networks that contribute to our purpose of creating brighter
lives for all. These collaborations are chosen to amplify and
accelerate our advocacy for a transition to more sustainable
economic models on material topics that align to our focus
areas of Nutrition & Health, Climate & Energy and Resources
& Circularity. Collaborative platforms and networks such as
these can result in progressive new measurement and
performance methods, as well as roadmaps for business
contributions toward the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). In this section, we describe some of the most
significant initiatives.
World Economic Forum (WEF)
We are a strategic partner of WEF and we actively participated
in their meetings throughout 2018, including the annual
meeting in Davos. We continued to strengthen our presence
at regional events, including in Africa, Latin America and Asia,
to highlight key partnerships and initiatives concerning
nutrition, circularity and climate change. We engaged in many
projects and initiatives of WEF, including the Partnership to
Accelerate the Circular Economy (PACE), Future of Proteins
and Bio-Innovation.
In 2018, we joined the Global Future Council on the New Social
Contract as part of our involvement in the Future of Education,
Gender and Work, and our CEO Feike Sijbesma co-chaired
the Consumer Governors and chaired the Alliance of CEO
Climate Leaders. The Alliance published an open letter ahead
of COP24 urging governments to be more ambitious in
addressing climate change.
World Business Council for Sustainable Development
(WBCSD)
We are a member of WBCSD and participate in different
working groups and coalitions. We are part of the Climate
Policy Working Group and our VP Sustainability sits on the
WBCSD Climate & Energy Program Board. We also joined the
Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
Preparer Forum for the chemical sector, which kicked off late
in the year.
We are a founding member of Food Reform for Sustainability
and Health (FReSH), a coalition between WBCSD and EAT, a
foundation focused on food systems that aims to transform
global food systems. We are a member of the Program Board
and we co-lead a number of workstreams. In 2018, two
'Science to Solutions' events were organized between top
scientists, civil society and business delegates to discuss
complex scientific challenges related to the food system. A
new study, 'Sustainable and Healthy Diets' on sustainable and
healthy dietary guidelines and food intake in 12 countries, and
the report 'Consumption Behavior and Trends' were
completed and published.We are part of the Leadership Group of the global campaign
'below50' from the Low Carbon Technology Partnerships
initiative (LCTPi), a multi-stakeholder platform led by the
WBCSD that presents the opportunities for large-scale
development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. In
2018, the below50 policy webtool was released, a tool offering
insights into local policies that increase the use of low-carbon
fuels and drive greater climate ambition.
Together with over 30 leading companies across 16 sectors,
we joined in a new circular economy initiative, Factor10, in
2018. Factor10 aims to reinvent the way that businesses
produce, use, and dispose of the materials that make up
global trade by moving away from the traditional 'take-make-
dispose' economic model to one that is regenerative by
design. As Co-Chair of the program, we will focus on circular
metrics, as well as on developing circular blueprints for the
built environment, automotive and bio-economy sectors.
We collaborated with eight other companies, the American
Chemistry Council, CEFIC and WBCSD on the Chemical
Sector SDG Roadmap in 2018. The roadmap, published in
July, details the impact categories and action points where the
chemical sector has the highest potential to make an impact
on the SDGs.
Accounting for Sustainability (A4S)
Our CFO Geraldine Matchett continued her active role as Co-
Chair of the A4S CFO Leadership Network. This network
brings together leading CFOs to help embed the management
of environmental and social issues into business processes
and strategy, particularly through the finance function.
Ms. Matchett is a signatory to the A4S CFO statement of
support for the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial
Disclosures recommendations.
In 2018, we contributed in particular to the A4S Culture
project, which aims to create a shift in the culture of the finance
profession in organizations that already have a strong focus
on sustainability. This includes showing finance professionals
why and how they can play a part in delivering sustainability
initiatives by motivating, empowering and inspiring them to
make the required changes. In November, the Culture project
delivered the A4S Essential Guide to Finance Culture, a guide
on how to integrate sustainability into the finance and decision-
making process.
Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC) convened by the
World Bank
In April, our CEO Feike Sijbesma co-chaired the High-Level
Assembly of the CPLC for the third and final year. The CPLC's
long-term objective is for effective carbon pricing to be applied
throughout the global economy. In addition to facilitating
leadership dialogues, the CPLC, together with partners, is also
mobilizing business support to put an internal price on carbon.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  36 www.dsm.comWe apply an internal carbon price of €  50 per ton CO 2eq when
reviewing large investments. Mr. Sijbesma, who serves the
World Bank Group as a Climate Leader since 2017, also
assumed the role of co-chair of the High-Level Leadership
Forum on Carbon Pricing and Competitiveness.
At various high-level events throughout the year, such as the
Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, and
New York Climate Week, Mr. Sijbesma shared our experience
with carbon pricing. He called on other businesses to
implement an internal carbon price and advocated for
embedding a price on carbon in global financial systems.
Ellen MacArthur Foundation
CE100 is the Foundation's global platform that brings together
companies, emerging innovators, universities and cities to
accelerate the transition toward a circular economy. In 2018,
together with Essity, IKEA and Tetra Pak we published a report
on renewable materials for a low-carbon and circular future.
This report was presented to the European Parliament at the
end of the year. The report shares the authors' vision for a low-
carbon and circular future, which aims to serve as input for the
mandates of the upcoming European Parliament and
Commission.
Circle Economy
In 2018, we continued our membership of Circle Economy, a
Dutch social enterprise that emphasizes practical and scalable
solutions in the transition toward a circular economy. We
joined their Circle Textiles Programme (with DSM Dyneema)
and their Circle Built Environment Programme (with DSM
Advanced Solar). We started a trial with Circle Assessment, a
digital tool that enables organizations to accelerate the
practical implementation of the circular economy. Workshops
and lunch sessions were organized at DSM in collaboration
with Circle Economy to increase employee awareness and
knowledge about the topic.
RE100
Our engagement with RE100, the world's leading campaign
to scale corporate sourcing of renewable power, continued
throughout 2018. We participated in the learning
opportunities, conferences and advocacy opportunities
offered to us in the EU, US and China. As part of our RE100
commitment, we shared our insights through webinars,
presentations and other engagements including our journey
with fellow RE100 members AkzoNobel, Google and Philips
to jointly source power from wind energy projects in the
Netherlands. For more information on renewable energy,
please see 'Planet' on page 52.
We Mean Business
We Mean Business activates hundreds of companies and
investors to commit to low-carbon initiatives. Our VP
Sustainability sits on the Business Advisory Board. In 2018,
we continued to work together on the Carbon PricingCorridors project led by CDP, CPLC and We Mean Business.
This project aims to enable large market players to define the
carbon prices needed for industry to meet the Paris
Agreement. We also worked on a number of advocacy and
communications activities around 'below50' and renewable
energy.
Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition (DSGC)
The DSGC is a CEO-led coalition of eight Dutch multinational
corporations which aim to drive sustainable growth business
models that combine economic profitability with
environmental and social progress and thus contribute to the
achievement of the SDGs. To accelerate this transition in the
Netherlands and abroad, the Coalition wants to lead the way
and pursues a strategy of Scale – Share – Shape. In 2018, the
Coalition assessed new fields for collaboration such as clean
shipping and the circular economy. Moreover, they engaged
with future leaders by hosting a community dinner at the 2018
One Young World Summit.
Catalyst
Catalyst is a non-profit organization that promotes inclusive
workplaces for women. We are a Global Supporter of Catalyst.
Our CEO Feike Sijbesma continued his role on the Board of
Directors and our CFO Geraldine Matchett her role on the
European Advisory Board. We are also represented on the
Catalyst Japan Advisory Board.
Our CTO shared with the Catalyst global community his
experiences on women in the scientific workplace, with his
daughter sharing her perspective on young women in science.
At the Catalyst Award dinner in New York City (New York,
USA), our colleagues shared their views and personal stories
on what it means to be a working woman in DSM with
Mr. Sijbesma and the President of DSM North America.
One Young World (OYW)
The One Young World Summit gathers 1,800 young leaders
from around the world, empowering them to make lasting
connections to create positive change for sustainable
development. In 2018, our CEO Feike Sijbesma joined the first
OYW Global Advisory Board, which aims to support and
champion the growing community, and gave a keynote
address. We were one of the largest business partners for the
2018 Summit in The Hague (Netherlands), sending 43 young
talents representing all businesses and regions, and
sponsoring five young leaders and social entrepreneurs from
Africa who are working on the topic of malnutrition via our DSM
Brighter Living Scholarship. On their return, our delegates will
act as intrapreneurs to engage fellow colleagues on purpose-
led projects.
UN World Food Programme (WFP)
In place since 2007, the DSM-WFP partnership 'Improving
Nutrition, Improving Lives' aims to improve the nutritional value
of the food that WFP distributes through product innovationsReport by the Managing Board — Stakeholders
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  37 www.dsm.comsuch as fortified rice and a product aimed at people living with
HIV/AIDS. Together, we make a difference to millions of
people. The DSM-WFP partnership was extended for a further
three years in 2018. The next phase of the partnership will put
even greater emphasis on raising awareness for improved
nutrition while continuing to develop new scientific and
technical solutions — one of which is a major project to
continue developing fortified rice, a crucial staple food in the
developing world.
In 2017, WFP reached 39.4 million beneficiaries with food that
had been improved by the DSM-WFP partnership.
Additionally, we collaborate on training and development
initiatives and on employee fundraising campaigns.
UNICEF
The DSM-UNICEF partnership has been in place since 2013.
The partnership with UNICEF and Sight and Life  continued
through the year, supporting the Government of Nigeria in
realizing its vision of scaling up the micronutrient powder
(MNP) program nationally, reaching people suffering from
malnutrition. In Nigeria, the partnership will build national
capacity to scale up the program and will advocate for
domestic resources to scale and sustain the interventions.
Together, we aim to directly impact the lives of one million
children in Nigeria, by providing access to MNP.
In 2018, the partnership with UNICEF and Sight and Life  was
extended through to 2021 and India was added as a focus
country. The partners will support the UNICEF India nutrition
program by seeking to engage private-sector stakeholders as
part of the government of India's Social Movement on Nutrition
program, from 2019 onwards. The cooperation in India will
focus on raising awareness to mobilize the private sector
around nutrition literacy.
World Vision International
Our partnership with World Vision and Sight and Life , titled
'Joining forces for last mile nutrition' aims to impact the well-
being of people at risk of micronutrient deficiencies and
influence key stakeholders. We leverage our scientific
excellence, technical expertise and extensive customer base
to facilitate the development and supply of innovative nutrition,
formulation and fortification.
In Rwanda, the partners worked on a pilot for a more efficient
supply chain for local maize production, working with farmers
and other stakeholders on improving the raw material quality
and access in Rwanda for Africa Improved Foods. The results
of the first pilot were positive, and the next phase will focus on
scale-up.
Together we initiated project EGGciting, focusing on eggs as
an important nutrition source. The project will kick off in 2019,
and will increase the availability, accessibility, and
consumption of eggs at the household level in Sulawesi byaddressing bottlenecks in the supply chain and driving
demand on the consumer side to improve nutrition.
Furthermore, a social business distribution model is being
scoped, to further help reach this goal.
Partners in Food Solutions
Partners in Food Solutions, an independent non-profit
organization, works to increase the growth and
competitiveness of food companies in Africa. These aims are
achieved by inspiring business leaders and linking highly
skilled corporate volunteers from a consortium of leading
companies, including DSM, Cargill, General Mills, Hersey,
Bühler and Ardent Mills, with promising entrepreneurs and
other influencers in the food ecosystem. The six corporate
partners have empowered hundreds of entrepreneurs to work
toward a stronger, more resilient food value chain across the
African continent.
DSM has an active network of almost 50 employees using their
technical, business and communications skills to work directly
with small and growing food processors. Our employee
volunteers are proud to engage in positive and meaningful
assignments to strengthen food security and foster economic
development in Africa.
Scaling Up Nutrition
The SUN Business Network (SBN) — co-hosted by the Global
Alliance for Improved Nutrition and the UN World Food
Programme — is the private-sector branch of the Scaling Up
Nutrition (SUN) Movement. It aims to support businesses in
growing the role they play in nutrition and to support SUN
countries in developing national business engagement
strategies. The SBN is located in 18 countries and includes
more than 400 companies, mostly SMEs. Our CEO Feike
Sijbesma is a member of the Lead Group of the SUN
Movement and Co-Chair of the Advisory Group of the
Network. Our VP of Nutrition in Emerging Markets and Public
Private Partnerships is on the Operations Committee of the
SBN.
Via the network, as well as the WFP partnership, we supported
a number of SBN projects in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi.
Together with the SBN global team, we initiated and organized
the first ever Nutrition Africa Investor Forum (NAIF), reframing
the dialogue around nutrition and raising its profile as an
impact investment opportunity. As an SBN global member, we
are supporting the implementation of SBN principles notably
around workforce nutrition commitments; overweight, obesity
and diet-related non-communicable diseases; and the delivery
of technical assistance to national SBNs and its members. We
advocate for business to take a leading role on these important
issues.
Africa Improved Foods
Africa Improved Foods (AIF) is a joint venture between the
Government of Rwanda and a consortium of Royal DSM, the
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  38 www.dsm.comDutch development bank (FMO), the DFID Impact Acceleration
Facility managed by CDC Group plc and the International
Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World
Bank Group. AIF sources local soy and maize from over
24,000 farmers across Rwanda to locally produce nutritious
fortified food products that meet the nutritional needs of
vulnerable population groups such as pregnant and breast-
feeding mothers, older infants, and young children. The Kigali
factory also supports over 300 skilled workers with well-paid
industrial jobs, providing employees with schooling and
income.
In 2018, AIF celebrated its first anniversary. The facility has an
annual capacity of 45,000 metric tons, which allows it to feed
over two million people per year on a consistent basis, making
it one of the largest food manufacturers in East Africa. AIF was
recognized for its contribution to economic growth and
sustainable development, winning awards such as the
Rwanda Development Board's Exporter of the Year 2018 and
Swiss Green Economy Symposium's UN Sustainable
Development Goals Award 2018. A recent impact study
conducted by the University of Chicago (Illinois, US) for IFC,
concluded that the net incremental value added of AIF to theRwandan economy between 2016-2031 amounts to USD 758
million. It is further estimated that AIF will contribute USD 85
million to Rwanda's foreign exchange position and add USD
142 million worth of value to East Africa through regional
purchases over the same period.
MANDI
DSM has been further expanding MANDI (Making A Nutrition
Difference to India), a socio-commercial business delivering
local nutritious products that are affordable and aspirational,
including fortified food and staple products, such as rice and
lentils, as well as vitamin and mineral supplements. India is
home to over 500 million inhabitants that are malnourished,
distributed across all social-economic classes. In 2018,
MANDI's strategy was reviewed. MANDI works with various
partners. In 2018, a successful distribution partnership was
set up with the Dharma Life Foundation.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  39 www.dsm.comExternal recognitions
We are proud when our efforts are recognized by others.
Below is a selection of some awards and recognitions that
DSM received from NGOs and trade organizations,
customers, suppliers and academia in 2018. A full list of our
recognitions can be found on the company website.
In June, DSM was awarded the 2018 Best Female Leadership
Companies  by the Shanghai Daily in China together with other
global industry leaders. Our corporate culture stood out
among the contestants.
In July, DSM received the Best Stakeholder Engagement and
Materiality Award at the Sustainable Business Awards 2018
ceremony in Singapore organized by Global Initiatives.
In August, Fortune Magazine  revealed that for the third
consecutive year, DSM again made Fortune Magazine's
Change the World list , an annual recognition of companies that
have a positive social impact through their core business
strategy. Fortune Magazine  also named DSM's CEO Feike
Sijbesma as one of the " World's Greatest Leaders " earlier in
the year.
In August, our DSM China President, Dr. Jiang Weiming was
selected in Fast Company China's 100 Most Creative People
in Business for 2018 . Fast Company recognized his innovative
spirit and sharp business acumen.In September, DSM was again among the leaders in the
Management Scope Corporate Impact Index . DSM scored
particularly high on sustainability, and also achieved a high
score on relationship with the outside world.
In October, DSM was awarded a position on Forbes' The
World's Best Employers 2018 list . Earlier in the year, we were
also awarded a position on their America's Best Midsize
Employers 2018 list .
In October, DSM received the Responsible Business of the

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  40 www.dsm.comESG Ratings and Benchmarks
At DSM, sustainability is at the heart of our business.
Sustainability is our core value; we see it as a key responsibility
and an important business driver. Our efforts and performance
are recognized externally (see, 'External recognitions'). We are
also included in several Environmental, Social, Governance
(ESG) Benchmarks and Ratings (see table below), of which in
most we score as (sector) leader.
The ESG benchmark sector is experiencing rapid growth. In
contrast to the financial world, where IFRS, for example, has
defined a global financial reporting standard, there is no global
standard for value creation and the ESG dimensions, yet. We
recognize that it is impossible for companies to participate in
every ESG benchmark.We are currently prioritizing our active participation in these,
and high on our list are benchmarks that are recognized,
valued and used by our stakeholders, including our investors,
that are transparent in their methodology, rely primarily on
publicly accessible information, will not create additional
administrative work, and provide participating companies with
sufficient feedback to enable them to make meaningful year-
on-year improvements. In that context DSM will also review its
continued active participation in some indices.
In 2018 we also renewed key sustainability and environmental
targets, such as greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency
and renewable energy. These are described in detail
elsewhere in this report and reported transparently also based
on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards.
In May, DSM was assessed as an ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) leader within the
chemicals industry by Sustainalytics, ranking number 1 out of 135 companies.
In April, DSM maintained an AA rating from MSCI. MSCI highlighted DSM's Corporate
Governance as a strength in the company's performance.
In September, DSM was once again named the leader in its industry group in the Dow Jones
Sustainability World Index. The company has been recognized among the DJSI leaders for 15

In September, DSM was again confirmed as a constituent of the FTSE4Good Index. We have
held a position on this list since 2004.
In November, DSM was again awarded a Gold CSR Rating by EcoVadis. Our score of 75 points,

People and organization strategy
In line with the strategy update, we have developed a people
and organization strategy for DSM for the coming years. We
will focus on six strategic levers:
-Operating model:  ensuring efficiency and growth through
globally leveraged functions, shared services and value-
chain-focused business groups, with the opportunity to
integrate acquisitions when needed
-Customer-centricity: putting the customer first in how we
focus, organize and build capabilities
-Internationalization & diversity:  developing a talent base
that is as global and diverse as the markets and customers
we serve
-Leadership & development:  developing people in line with
our growth aspirations as a business, with people managers
playing a vital role
-Team by team: engaging teams effectively to ensure high
performance, collaboration and agility
-Culture / The DSM Ways of Working: Doing Something
Meaningful, every day, that contributes to delivering our
strategy
Culture / The DSM Ways of Working
In line with the update of our strategy, we have also reviewed
our One DSM Culture Agenda and developed it into a new
culture agenda called 'The DSM Ways of Working'. We are a
purpose-led, performance-driven company. How we deliver
our purpose and strategy is supported by The DSM Ways of
Working. Doing Something Meaningful, every day starts with
us as individuals, by doing the right things in our daily jobs.The DSM Ways of Working describe the mindset that enables
everyone in DSM to make a difference, and drives accelerated
business growth. The DSM Ways of Working build on three
behaviors – Customer passion inspires innovation,
Accountability and agility spark success, and Inclusiveness
brightens our future.
Customer passion inspires innovation 
We always put our customers first. We know our customers
and make their success our business. 
We combine curiosity, technology, and outside-in thinking to
bring their needs and our innovation together. By creating
meaningful solutions, we deliver value for our customers, every
day.
Accountability and agility spark success  
We deliver on our promises and respond to challenges quickly.
Clear expectations, trust and freedom to act allow us to make
responsible judgements and flourish, every day. 
We live safety unconditionally — I care, we care, every day.
Inclusiveness brightens our future  
We value uniqueness and foster a sense of purpose and
belonging. We embrace all aspects of diversity to enrich our
thinking. Connectivity allows us to collaborate effectively
without boundaries. We are stronger together, every day.
All our employees globally will be onboarded with The DSM
Ways of Working. We started the process in June 2018 at
leadership level and will continue to engage different DSM
audiences in several phases. Throughout 2019 and 2020, The
DSM Ways of Working will be embedded in our key people
processes to ensure a consistent employee experience.
Progress will be measured as of 2019.Report by the Managing Board — People

Occupational and process safety
Employee health includes safety at work. We strive to be an
incident- and injury-free company. At the end of the day,
people should leave work exactly as they came, if not better.
So it is with deep regret that we report a fatal accident that
occurred at our DSM Nutritional Products (Tortuga) site in
Pecém (Brazil).
Both occupational and process safety are extremely important
to us. Occupational safety is the safety of people (employees
and contractors). Process safety is the safe operation of
facilities. We set targets, define actions and monitor safety
performance as described in the DSM Responsible Care Plan
2016–2020. We report our occupational and process safety
performance with frequency indexes. For a full description of
these indexes, see 'Explanation of some concepts and ratios'
on page 242.
Occupational safety
In 2018, the Frequency Index of all DSM Recordable Injuries
improved from 0.36 to 0.33, with the majority of our sites
injury-free. This demonstrates that zero incidents are
achievable. Still, we must further intensify our efforts in the
coming years to meet our ambitious target of 0.25 by 2020.
Our focus will be on those sites where improvements are
needed. The Frequency Index of Lost Workday Cases for DSM
employees improved to 0.11 in 2018 versus 0.16 in 2017.
The Frequency Index of Recordable Injuries among
contractors further deteriorated to 0.51 in 2018 versus 0.46 in
2017. A factor in this trend is the increase in contractors
relative to DSM employees in plant maintenance and upgrade
activities. To counter this trend, we will increase our focus on
contractor supervision. However, we also see encouraging
signs in contractor safety. The Blue Sky project at our
Jiangshan production facility (Jiangsu Province, China) was
completed in 2018: it reported only one health incident (heat
stroke) and no safety incidents. The project required
approximately 2.2 million contractor man-hours and 2,000
employees on site at peak times.

00.11DSM Target FI REC All 2020: 0.250.33In 2018, we focused on keeping safety awareness high
through our Living Safety Campaign 'I Care, We Care'. This
campaign offered global guidance through quarterly themes
and locally relevant programs at site level. The initiatives to
strengthen leadership and create capabilities that had begun
in 2017 continued. A series of workshops and intensive
training efforts increased awareness and focus on safety.
During 2018, 1,066 leaders and managers completed
intensive safety trainings, which is an increase of 84% versus
2017. Special attention was given to the safety onboarding of
new executives.
A new set of global leading performance indicators was
developed throughout the year. These enable us to more
proactively tackle safety observations, preventing incidents
from occurring. We expect to start reaping the benefits in
2019. These indicators are aligned with the key items that
emerged from the safety-first workshops from the 'I Care, We
Care' program.
Despite our efforts, a tragic accident took place in September
2018 at DSM's Tortuga site in Pecém (Brazil), where a
contractor lost his life. This has shocked all of us at DSM and
we are supporting the affected family through this difficult time.
This stresses once again that Health & Safety must always
remain our top priority: we must ensure that people come
home safely and must continuously improve our safety
performance every day. The root causes have been thoroughly
investigated and the lessons learned are being implemented.
We have included transport and warehouse safety in our
revision of the DSM Life Saving Rules to improve standards of
warehouse safety across the whole of our company. We are
committed to the safety of all workers, including the safety of
our contractors.
The incidents that still occur, along with the severity of their
consequences, signal the challenge to ensure that everyone,
all of the time, uses safe working practices that prevent
accidents. Efforts in further building risk recognition
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  44 www.dsm.comcapabilities and competences, as well as standardization of
high-risk working activities, will continue in 2019.
Process safety
Process safety incidents are rare but can have a major impact
on people and the environment. Process safety is measured
via the Frequency Index of Process Safety Incidents (PSI), and
we have a target for 2020 of 0.15.

The Process Safety Incident rate deteriorated from 0.19 in
2017 to 0.22 in 2018. Most incidents were related to the
unintentional release of substances from plants or storage
facilities and were remediated without further consequence.
The increase in the PSI rate is due to a better understanding
of managing and reporting PSIs in one of our businesses. We
are focusing our efforts on the incidents highlighted by this
process in order to reverse the trend. There was a small
number of other incidents, which are described in the chapter
'What still went wrong in 2018' on page 138.
Additional training efforts, in combination with applying more
strict qualification criteria, are being rolled out to increase the
competences of people executing key roles in process safety
management. We will convert existing good practices
(guidance notes) into mandatory standards to improve
standardization and bring focus to effective implementation.
Employee health
At DSM, we believe in a positive culture of health at work. This
increases the intrinsic motivation of employees to make
healthy, sustainable lifestyle choices. Our health management
system is based on prevention, primary care and promotion.
DSM has an extensive industrial hygiene program which also
addresses physical hazards and exposure to hazardous
substances. Through the design of our processes and
products, as well as providing proper protective equipment,
we aim to prevent occupational illness. Primary care is
provided by site-based medical professionals and also
includes emergency preparedness and first aid. Promotion of
good health is continuously addressed through a wide rangeof health promotion activities and is reflected in our Safety,
Health and Environment policies.
An example of both health promotion and health prevention
within our company is our Vitality@DSM program.
Vitality@DSM is a voluntary program that helps employees
track and assess their physical, social and mental well-being.
We had approximately 1,000 participants in 2018. 68% of the
participants reported low lifestyle-related risks, 32% of the
participants reported moderate to high risks. Participants
received customized advice to help improve their overall well-
being, support early intervention before disease and maintain
employability. According to the group report, due to
interventions and changes of lifestyle made by the target group
we save approximately 1% per year from reduced productivity
loss.
In 2018, we continued to promote the Global Corporate
Challenge, a team-based approach to stimulate increased
physical activities, improved nutrition, sleep and psychological
well-being of our employees. Although the number of
participants declined compared to 2017, 83% of the
participants in 2018 achieved the recommended daily levels
for physical effort of 10,000 steps per day (up from 77% in
2017). Due to these efforts, 68% of the participants reported
that they experienced reduced stress levels at home or at work
and 51% of the participants reported an increase in
productivity or concentration.
Local wellness initiatives are actively encouraged. For
example, in the Netherlands we are making all our premises
smoke-free, we offer healthy choices in the company
restaurants and we focus on prevention of work stress.
Occupational health cases
Despite our efforts in the area of occupational health, the
number of reported health cases increased from 14 in 2017
to 29 in 2018. We reported in 2017 that several employees at
our Jiangshan site (Jiangsu Province, China) indicated they
were suffering from hearing loss. These cases have been
thoroughly investigated and 15 cases of hearing loss have
been included in the overall figure. The remaining cases were
mainly related to ergonomics at the workplace as well as skin
irritation (two cases) during lab work.
Privacy concerns or cultural factors may influence employees'
willingness to report and discuss personal health issues, so
some occupational health cases may go unreported. We
continue to raise awareness about stress and other
occupational health risks and to encourage transparency.Report by the Managing Board — People

for 2017.
Workforce engagement
Having an engaged workforce is essential for our success,
now and in the future. The DSM Employee Engagement
Survey, run annually since 2007, helps us understand how our
employees feel at work and where we need to improve. Our
goal is to ensure that people are proud to work at DSM and
have the opportunity to contribute and excel at what they do.
The Engagement Index measures four attributes:
commitment, pride, advocacy and satisfaction. In 2017, we
switched to a shorter version of the survey that still collects
essential information about safety, engagement, inclusion and
other key themes.
The 2018 survey was sent to all employees and was available
in 21 languages. The 2018 response rate of 87% (up five
percentage points) was the highest we have recorded since
we started measuring employee engagement. The
Engagement Index was 76% (up one percentage point) in
2018, a new record for us.
At global DSM level, we saw an improvement of at least one
percentage point on 19 out of the 22 questions. There was a
notable increase in the area of career opportunities, a topic
that was defined as a focus area from the 2017 survey. We
have recorded a three percentage point increase on the
question “I am satisfied with career opportunities at DSM”. We
also saw an increase in perceived opportunities for learning
and development (up two percentage points) and regular
development conversations (up one percentage point). We
believe that there is still further room for improvement on these
three topics, so they will remain a focus area for the coming
year.x“ At DSM, we believe that
everybody's contribution
counts in creating a thriving
business and, at the same
time, brighter lives for all. We
all take great pride in Doing
Something Meaningful,
every day.  ”
Judith Wiese, DSM Executive Committee
Inclusion & diversity
Our inclusion & diversity activities focus on two main topics:
-Increasing representation of women and under-represented
nationalities at executive level and throughout our
management pipeline to fuel innovation and growth in every
country where we operate
- Creating an inclusive work environment in which each
employee can contribute
By 2020, we aim for 25% of our executives to be female and
for at least 60% of our executives to come from under-
represented nationalities. We achieved an improvement in
both areas in 2018 thanks to continued focus and
commitment on the part of all businesses and functions. The
percentage of female executives in 2018 reached 19% (2017:
17%), while the number of under-represented nationalities at
executive level increased to 60% (2017: 56%), achieving our
2020 aim of 60% ahead of schedule.
The targets to increase the diversity of our talent pipeline below
executive level also focus both on gender and nationality mix.
Both measures saw a positive trend across all our businesses
and functions in 2018, with female representation increasing
by three percentage points and under-represented
nationalities increasing by two percentage points.
In line with Dutch legislation, the diversity policy for the
Executive Committee, Managing Board and Supervisory
Board aims for at least 30% male and at least 30% female
members. In addition, it aims for no more than 50% of the
Executive Committee and Supervisory Board to be drawn
from one nationality. For more detail, see 'Corporate
governance' on page 108.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  46 www.dsm.comWith the appointment of Patricia Malarkey as Chief Innovation
Officer, our Executive Committee's gender diversity
percentage will be 43%, while the number of nationalities has
been further diversified. In 2018, the gender diversity
percentage was 29%, with a maximum of 43% drawn from
one nationality, in line with our target of not having more than
50% drawn from one nationality. Our Managing Board,
consisting of one female and two male members, is fully
aligned with the figure of 30% prescribed by Dutch legislation
in terms of gender balance. Our Supervisory Board is also well
balanced, in terms of both gender and nationalities, and is in
line with Dutch legislation in this regard. More than one third
(43%) of its members are women. Furthermore, in the
Supervisory Board of DSM Nederland B.V., a subsidiary of
Royal DSM, one of the three members is female (33%).
In 2018, DSM addressed unconscious bias in our Women
Inspired Network activities. Unconscious bias refers to the
unconscious assumptions and attitudes we all have that
influence our behavior. This focus supports our employees to
understand how we can become more aware of our behavior.
On International Women's Day, we held a global DSM
campaign titled 'Women in Science and Technology –
Unconscious Bias' to highlight the role of women in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics, and promote the
work we do to improve inclusion in the company. The
November 2018 People Manager campaign helped people
managers to understand what they can do to combat
unconscious bias. More than 20 female and male employees
participated in the Women's International Networking
Conference in Rome (Italy).
In addition, a workshop was designed to address inclusion
and diversity, with a specific focus on unconscious bias. The
workshop's objective is to create more inclusive teams by
improving awareness about the importance of inclusion and
diversity and to define actions on how to overcome
unconscious bias. The first workshops were delivered in 2018,
with the full roll-out planned for 2019.
Our inclusion efforts, monitored via the Employee Engagement
Survey's Inclusion Index, increased from 71% in 2017 to 72%
in 2018. Employees have shared they feel more comfortable
sharing their ideas (up one percentage point) and they are
more involved in decisions that affect their work (up two
percentage points). We are proud of this increase and will
continue to focus our efforts in creating an even more inclusive
work environment in DSM.
Going forward, we will also continue to address the
geographical distribution of executives and other key
functions, keeping a keen eye on nationality balance. From
2019, we will focus on improving the representation of non-
Europeans in the executive group to further reflect our global
footprint. As the long-term target for nationality mix has alreadybeen reached, we will redefine our goals for nationality balance
as of 2019.
Leadership and development at DSM
Developing our talent
At DSM, we believe that learning and development fuels the
growth of our employees and leaders. Creating the conditions
in which our people can learn and develop faster will enable
us to grow. In 2018, we continued to increase our emphasis
on learning through the 70:20:10 principle: 70% learning
through experience (such as guided on-the-job assignments),
20% learning through others (such as peer-group learning and
mentoring), and 10% learning through formal sources (such
as classroom training and digital learning). By this approach,
we are creating a culture of continuous learning in which
people learn from experience, feedback, reflection,
experiments, and mistakes, and not just from training courses.
We work in close cooperation with leading international
business schools and global learning content providers —
such as Duke Corporate Education, IMD, Ashridge Executive
Education, Vlerick Business School, and CrossKnowledge —
to design and deliver high-quality learning activities for our
employees around the world. The European Foundation for
Management Development (EFMD) awarded us the EFMD
Excellence in Practice Gold Medal 2018 for Professional
Development in recognition of our partnership with Vlerick
Business School on our learning journeys to drive Marketing
& Sales Excellence.
The learning platforms that are available to all our employees
feature easily accessible online learning catalogs, learning
resources and courses that are available via smartphone apps,
and online tooling to identify and select on-the-job
experiences. The new global learning management system
introduced in 2017 began to replace local legacy systems
across the globe during 2018, with finalization planned for
2019.
Learning and development through experiences with
Experience Maps and X-Time
In 2018, we introduced the concept of 'Experience Maps', to
facilitate learning through (on-the-job) experience. The
Experience Map describes a variety of broadening and
functional experiences that can create impactful learning.
Employees and people managers use the Experience Map to
strengthen their development conversations and to plan and
accelerate experience-based development that is aligned with
individual career goals, interests and potential. In 2018,
Experience Maps were launched for the functional areas
Finance, IT, and People & Organization.
Also in 2018, we piloted the 'X-Time' platform in the US. It
enables employees who are seeking development
experiences to look for available on-the-job experiences
throughout the company. X-Time serves as an online projectReport by the Managing Board — People
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  47 www.dsm.commarketplace designed to connect people and drive results at
DSM. Managers who are seeking resources and capabilities
for specific projects can post roles on the easy-to-navigate
online marketplace and connect with employees across the
company. Employees participating in an X-Time experience
can commit up to 10% of their time to this project — enough
time to make a meaningful contribution while continuing to
meet their current obligations. Through X-Time, employees
can build new capabilities and relationships which will enrich
their development and careers.
Learning and development through others with Bright
Mentoring
Mentoring plays an important role in learning through others.
We revamped the Bright Mentoring initiatives across all
regions in 2018, creating a consistent experience for all
mentors and mentees worldwide. Bright Mentoring consists
of a global mentoring program, regional mentoring programs,
and a new reverse mentoring initiative. Program participants
can stay connected to one another, share best practices, and
learn from each other through connection point webinars as
well as our internal social media platform. In 2018, over 120
employees participated in the global mentoring program, while
our regional mentoring programs involved more than 600
participants across all regions, including almost 90
participants with a cross-regional mentoring relationship.
The reverse mentoring program was initiated by the Inclusion
& Diversity Council to foster inclusion and diversity at DSM.
Almost 50 people participated in this program. The Reverse
Bright Mentoring program connects senior DSM executives as
mentees to bright talents as mentors. In the reverse mentoring
relationship, the bright talent in an early stage of her or his
career provides mentoring to a more senior leader to offer skills
and share knowledge from different perspectives (such as
generation, gender and culture).
Developing our leaders & people managers
Developing both our leaders and our people managers
remains a key priority for us at DSM. The DSM Leadership
Model, introduced in 2012, provides a common vision and
language for leadership at our company and specifies the
behaviors we expect from our leaders and people managers.
It remains fully embedded across the organization and
continues to be a foundational element of new learning and
development initiatives.
DSM's Leadership Transition Programs support our managers
in their development through each transition in their careers.
Based on pilots in 2017, we launched three blended learning
journeys across all regions in 2018: Leading Self, Leading
Others and Leading Leaders. Key elements of these learning
journeys are a strong online learning environment and pre- and
post-work involving participants' managers to ensure strong
commitment and follow-up. The programs are delivered by a
joint team of external facilitators, company senior executives,designated talents, and internal talent development
consultants to maximize the relevance of the experience to
everyday working life at DSM.
In 2018, we continued our online campaign 'People Manager
2018'. Every month, this campaign highlights a topic that is of
relevance for our people managers. Our peer group learning
sessions 'Meet, Share and Learn' were offered at critical
moments in the P&O cycle: Goal-Setting, Talent Review,
Development Conversations, and Performance Reviews.
Strengthening our talent pipeline
Talent development is a key priority for the leadership of our
company. To further grow our business, we need to develop
all our people so that they achieve their full potential. At DSM,
talent development focuses on building a sustainable talent
pipeline that is diverse, global, with the right balance of deep
expertise and broad leadership. Core to our approach is the
belief that talent is in everyone: what matters is looking at what
kind of potential you have, and the best development path to
reach your full potential.
Attracting and selecting talent
Attracting the right talent is crucial when building a sustainable
talent pipeline. In 2018, DSM was included in the Forbes list
of the World's Best Employers, recognized as a thought leader
on candidate engagement by Gartner, and also featured as a
finalist in the LinkedIn Talent Awards.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  48 www.dsm.comWe continued to drive digital innovation within the Global
Talent Acquisition organization by launching a new digital
hiring platform. This platform enables us to meet the needs of
the modern talent marketplace with video interviewing
software and assessments. Our hiring intelligence platform is
transforming the way we discover, hire, and develop talent.
We proactively identified more than 800 high-quality
candidates using artificial intelligence sourcing tools and
employer brand marketing campaigns within DSM
Engineering Plastics, the procurement function, and the
Nutrition cluster.
We invested in upskilling the organization, with people
managers trained in the (he)Art of Hiring, including training on
unconscious bias and inclusion & diversity. We offered more
than 400 internships, and more than 300 early career hires
participated in our MATCH! and other graduate talent
programs around the world. We hired over 3,000 employees
via our regional recruitment teams in 2018. We also enhanced
the candidate experience, with a candidate satisfaction rating
of 92% globally — our highest ever.Identifying and developing future talent
One of the key focus areas for strengthening our talent pipeline
is to identify a broader pool of emerging leaders — early career
talent who could be stretched into accelerated career
development. Development for emerging leaders continues,
and this is the most diverse group from a gender and
nationality perspective. Our first emerging leader pool of 2016
shows an overall positive picture, with a retention rate of 88%.
Our emerging leaders are also generally in fast-track mode,
with 70% in their current position for less than three years and
42% promoted one or more levels since their designation. The
emerging leader pool increased by 28% in 2018 compared to
2017. Within our senior talent group, which continued to
increase in size and diversity, we saw retention rates of over
90%. This trend was complemented by very good career
moves, including some cross-business redeployments, which
are key to helping us develop senior leaders with broader
experience and skills sets. Going forward, our focus will be on
broadening the experience opportunities of our talents, as this
is key to strengthening our pipeline.
Report by the Managing Board — People
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  49 www.dsm.comA turnover rate of 9.5% in our executive pipeline has enabled
us to increase the diversity and geographical spread of our
executive population. The overall succession strength for our
business and functional leadership teams remained stable
compared to 2017. Going forward, we will have to maintain
our focus on this topic throughout 2019, with a particular
emphasis on succession planning.
Total rewards
Our total rewards strategy aims to support the realization of
our business objectives through monetary and non-monetary
rewards. It serves as a reference frame for compensation and
benefit plans and programs across the organization, and is
designed to:
- Ensure a consistent and fair approach in our reward
programs across employee segments and geographies,
contributing to a consistent employee value proposition
around the globe
- Support the further development toward a high-
performance organization and culture, help to attract,
engage and retain high caliber employees and to reinforce
desired behaviors
- Get the maximum out of our investments in rewarding
talents
In 2018, we reviewed our total rewards strategy to align it with
the recent strategy update. This review also aligns the possible
contributions of reward tools, products and services to the six
strategic levers as highlighted in the renewed people &
organization strategy. An example is the inclusion of
customer-centricity in our incentive schemes.
In 2018, further steps were made to align and standardize
salary structures on a global scale using a set of shared basic
principles. This helps to further enhance the use of a global
platform to manage salary adjustments in a consistent way.
Major steps have been made in aligning and deploying global
sales incentive plans within the outlines of the Sales
Compensation Framework. New tooling has been introduced
allowing the business to improve goal setting, monitor
progression in sales results and subsequent incentive pay, and
to steer on predefined KPIs during the year.
A global annual cash incentive framework for non-sales,
known as the Short-Term Incentive (STI) Framework, was
introduced, with a phased roll-out started in the last quarter of
2018. The new Framework replaces a broad variety of existing
plans, emphasizing that we are one company working toward
the same business objectives. The new STI Framework:
- Better aligns pay and performance and focuses on the
achievement of business objectives by aligning objectives
top-to-bottom within the organization- Significantly reduces the number of STI plans, enabling
more efficient and consistent plan/program management
and administration (global tooling)
Driving performance
Individual performance evaluations
Regular performance evaluations play an important role in
ensuring we are performance driven. Over 14,000 employees
have access to the digital evaluation tool for performance
reviews. All other employees participate in performance
evaluations on paper or with other local systems. Our
approach to target-setting focuses on 'Fewer, Bigger, Better
Goals' that are measurable, relevant and challenging.
Continuous Improvement in operations
One of the ways in which we drive organizational performance
is by fostering a culture of continuous improvement across
manufacturing sites and supply chain environments. This
mindset is driven by the DSM Integral Continuous
Improvement (DICI) journey, which is currently running in 83%
of our Manufacturing and Supply Chain organizations. The
premix locations are currently excluded from the DICI scope.
We focus on empowering all our people, so they can make the
many small improvements that can have a significant impact
on operations and on our employee engagement —
unleashing the talent in everyone. This journey is being
executed together with one common way of working, which
enables us to share and learn across sites and businesses
much faster than before.
A group of operators in Waalwijk (Netherlands) had the
ambition that each operator should have the motivation and
the power to optimize his own workplace. They engaged all
shifts in mini kaizen workshops which resulted in many
practical improvements: reduced workload, batch time
reduction, better ergonomics and yield improvements. This
example of changing the mindset of the work force by using
the DICI methodology won the DSM Operations Continuous
Improvement Award, presented by Managing Board member
Dimitri de Vreeze.
In Belvidere (New Jersey, USA), the team utilized coaching and
feedback in supporting the learning process of all site
employees. They boosted the continuous improvement
culture by measuring behavior in 'High Impact' moments,
providing feedback — in the moment and one-on-one — and
developing coaches in the site organization. This resulted in
big improvements in the culture at their fermentation plant —
very positive Gemba walks, more effective meetings, people
feel listened to and feel more inspired by their supervisors.
Responsible business practices
International Labour Standards
We apply the International Labour Standards of the
International Labour Organisation. We respect the role of
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  50 www.dsm.comworks councils and collective bargaining and work with these
groups in the countries and regions in which they are present.
We develop social plans and severance programs in the event
of significant reorganizations. We promote employee
empowerment and human rights protection and maintain
dialogues with employees and representative bodies to enable
this.
Human rights
Our purpose as a company means that respecting human
rights is fundamental to achieving the sustainable societal
advances to which we aspire. We believe that the basic rights
and freedoms to which all people are entitled — human rights
— should be understood, respected and promoted by all
companies as the cornerstone of socially responsible
business.
We have a long-standing commitment to international
declarations and the relevant instruments to safeguard these,
including:
- The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
(the Ruggie Framework)
- The ILO International Labour Standards
- The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
We have been a signatory to the UN Global Compact since
2007.
Our commitment to human rights is defined in our position
paper on the company website. The development of our
human rights policy helps embed the responsibility for
respecting human rights into the programs, policies and daily
operations of all business functions and regions. Our global
whistleblower policy (DSM Alert) is in place so that employees
and external stakeholders can report any perceived violations
of human rights as well as violations of laws and regulations.
In 2018, we mapped the potential human rights impacts of our
business activities through a global risk assessment. A human
rights steering committee was additionally set up to further
strengthen the governance structure. The cross-functional
steering committee will create a more integrated and
coordinated approach, supervising progress on human rights
both within our company and in our supply and distribution
chains. The steering committee is chaired by Judith Wiese, the
EVP Group People & Organization.
In addition to the steering committee, a working group
launched the first initiative to translate the outcome of the
global risk assessment into a human rights action plan during
2018. The working group is composed of representatives of
the various functions on the steering committee. This action
plan focuses on:- Further embedding human rights (integrating human rights
policies into relevant business processes and raising
awareness of these policies)
- Risk management (impact assessment in operations in
high-risk countries, with a specific focus on vulnerable
groups)
- Supply chain (onboarding and support systems where
needed)
We regularly review our rewards framework to make sure it
meets the standards of our total rewards strategy and fair
remuneration. In 2018, we focused on our commitment to
equal pay and a living wage. We define comparable pay and
remuneration for men and women for doing work that requires
equivalent qualifications and skills. We have further elaborated
our position on equal pay in an equal pay statement on the
company website. In addition, a reporting process was
developed to execute a gender pay gap ratio and living wage
analysis. We will establish the process to obtain and validate
the required data to ensure consistent, accurate and
transparent reporting.
Beyond our own operations, potential labor and human rights
impacts are handled through our Supplier Sustainability
Program (SSP). We assess suppliers for potential human
rights issues through Together for Sustainability / EcoVadis
sustainability assessments and audits. Read more about our
SSP and how we manage potential human rights impacts
within our supply chain on page 146. For more information on
the steps we have taken relating to Modern Slavery in our
supply chain, please see the company website.Report by the Managing Board — People

portfolio of Brighter Living Solutions, our Safety, Health &
Environment (SHE) policy, and our position on issues such as
product stewardship, industrial biotechnology and
biodiversity. We focus on improving our environmental
footprint, enabling our customers to do the same, and
advocating on our key environmental topics. Our Brighter
Living Solutions — solutions that are better than the
mainstream reference solution for people and/or the planet —
account for 62% of our net sales (excluding the temporary

Our operations network spans more than 110 commercial
production facilities in over 40 countries. The DSM
Responsible Care Plan 2016–2020, an essential part of our
company strategy, describes our environmental targets and
what actions we are taking. Our approach supports the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 7
(Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 12 (Responsible
Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).
This chapter addresses our approach on several topics from
our materiality matrix:
- Climate change & renewable energy
- Resource scarcity / Circular economy
- Water security
- Biodiversity
- Product stewardship

Climate change & renewable energy
In 2015, the Paris Agreement first established the urgent need
to take action on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to limit
temperature increases to well below 2°C. In Strategy 2021,
we revised our GHG emissions target in order to bring it in line
with the Paris Agreement. Our new target, announced in 2018,
is a 30% absolute reduction of our scope 1 + 2 emissions by
2030 versus our 2016 baseline. This is below a 2°C pathway.
We will achieve this target through a wide-ranging number of
actions across all our operations, including: (1) renewable
electricity: 50% of purchased electricity to be sourced from
renewables by 2025, increasing to 75% by 2030; and (2)
energy efficiency improvement: an average year-on-year
improvement of at least 1% until 2030.An additional scope 3 intensity reduction target of 28% by
2030 versus our 2016 baseline has been agreed which,
together with our scope 1 + 2 target, meets the criteria for a
Science-Based Target. DSM's climate change strategy
received an A- rating from CDP in 2018.

1Including a one-time effect of large plant shutdowns in 2018, estimated at roughly
150 kt. These effects will not take place in 2019.
2Adjusted using updated emission factors and assumptions.
3The 2017 figure has been adjusted positively because of improved data quality.
In support of our ambition to substantially reduce our carbon
footprint we have introduced new measures which we apply
to all growth projects. Starting from 2019, business growth
projects must either be GHG-neutral or else be compensated
for. In addition, to encourage investments in low-carbon and
carbon-free technologies, we use an internal carbon price of
€ 50/t CO 2eq in the valuations of key investment projects.
Scope 1 + 2 GHG emissions
We actively manage our absolute GHG emissions reduction,
GHG efficiency and energy efficiency.
Our scope 1 + 2 market-based GHG emissions decreased
from 1.50 in 2017 to 1.23 million tons of CO 2eq in 2018. Our
GHG efficiency improved from 26% in 2017 to 33% in 2018
versus our 2008 baseline3. In addition to improvement actions,
a large part of the result is due to planned maintenanceReport by the Managing Board — Planet
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  53 www.dsm.comshutdowns (contributing approximately 150 kt CO 2eq). The
effect of the shutdowns is temporary, impacting the year in
which the shutdown was executed. The increased use of
renewable energy (contributing approximately 80 kt CO 2eq)
resulted in a significant permanent improvement of our GHG
emissions. The energy efficiency improvement measures also
contributed to the improved GHG performance. Projects
included a switch at DSM Nutritional Products' site in
Kingstree (South Carolina, USA) from a solvent-based to a
water-based technology, requiring less energy and,
consequently generating a smaller environmental footprint.
Taking all these different factors into account, we can split the
development of the absolute GHG emissions into an
underlying structural improvement (such as contributions from
renewable electricity, and energy efficiency gains) and some
one-time effects from major plant shutdowns (such as
maintenance). The structural improvement gains will vary year-
on-year depending on the potential renewable electricity
initiatives and the magnitude of the improvement projects
executed within the company. We estimate the effect of the
underlying structural improvements in absolute GHG
emissions to be roughly 8% in 2018 versus 2016. The absolute
GHG emission reduction (the sum of the structural and one-
time effects) amounts to approximately 18% in 2018 versus
2016.
The overall balance shows that we are well on track to achieve
the targets defined in the Responsible Care Plan 2016–2020,
thanks to our investments in greenhouse gas efficiency
improvements and energy improvements.
x“ We cannot address climate
change alone. We play our
part by improving our own
footprint, enabling our
customers to do the same,
and advocating for progress
on this important issue.  ”

Energy transition
Our energy efficiency improvement was 5.1% in 2018 versus
our 2015 baseline. The annual improvement for 2018 versus
2017 was 1.4%.
3For 2017, the GHG efficiency improvement is based on market-based
emissions. For the period before 2017, market-based emissions were not
measured, so the GHG efficiency improvement is based on location-based
emissions.Our efforts to reduce our energy utilization and greenhouse
gas emissions were supported by a range of improvement
proposals from the business groups which were implemented
during 2018. This program encompasses projects for saving
heat, fuel and electricity with a total greenhouse gas
improvement potential expected to yield 30kt in greenhouse
gas reduction and energy efficiency improvements of 2%
annually as of 2019.
Projects carried out as part of this program in 2018 included
one at our DSM Nutritional Products site in Dalry (UK), where
an optimization of the distillation column resulted in a
significant reduction of steam usage, and another at our DSM
Dyneema site in Laiwu (Shandong Province, China), where
multiple small optimizations were made to the air compression
and cooling networks.
Renewable energy
DSM is a member of the Climate Group's RE100, comprising
leading companies that have committed to sourcing 100% of
their electricity from renewable sources at the earliest possible
opportunity. Our commitment is to source 75% of our
electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 100% at the
earliest possible opportunity.
In 2018, we have been making significant progress toward our
target of renewable electricity. The percentage of purchased
electricity from renewable sources increased from 21% in
2017 to 41% in 2018, clearly a step-change increase due to
contractual agreements. In the Netherlands, Windpark
Bouwdokken commenced full production in April, while the
larger Windpark Krammer went operational in stages
throughout 2018. An additional contract brought the coverage
of purchased electricity from renewable sources in the
Netherlands to 100%. At our DSM Nutritional Products
manufacturing sites in Switzerland, approximately 50% of the
electricity comes from renewable sources. Our Power
Purchase Agreement in the US is currently providing an
estimated 40% of our requirements from wind power.
We also look for opportunities to replace fossil fuels used in
our processes. The biomass cogeneration plant at our DSM
Nutritional Products site in Sisseln (Switzerland) is the first
major success in this area. This plant replaces the site's old
natural gas-fired cogeneration plant. Our partners, ENGIE and
EWZ, have built the biomass plant, which they will own,
operate and maintain. The plant will commence production in
early 2019, and is scheduled to result in 48 kt CO 2eq reduction
per year (of which about 80% is for us and 20% for other
partners).
Scope 3 GHG emissions
Our scope 3 emissions amounted to approximately 11.3
million tons CO 2eq in 2018. This figure is based on calculations
using adjusted emission factors, extrapolations and updated
assumptions. In 2018, a detailed re-assessment of scope 3
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  54 www.dsm.comcategories was carried out. The 2017 figures have been
recalculated using the same approach.
The largest adjustments took place in emissions from 'End-of-
life treatment of sold products'. Revised verified landfilling
assumptions, exclusion of bio-based and inorganic products,
and adjustment of emissions from incineration as per the
Guidance for Accounting and Reporting Corporate GHG
Emissions in the Chemical Sector Value Chain, provided by
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, led
to a significant restatement of this category. The figure for
'Purchased goods and services' was adjusted using updated
emission factors.
Our emissions in 2018 decreased by 1.8 million tons primarily
due to the divestment of participations in former DSM
businesses (DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals, and
caprolactam business via ChemicaInvest). The main scope 3
category in the 2018 figures is 'Purchased goods and
services' which slightly decreased compared to 2017.

A supplier emission reduction program called CO2REDUCE
has been developed in cooperation with several key suppliers.
Increased engagement is a core element in our defined
supplier program. During our inaugural Supplier Partnership
Day in the Netherlands, which was held in September, our
commitment to reduce carbon emissions from suppliers was
a central theme, generating a clear call to action. This event
was attended by more than 75 prominent key suppliers and
featured a keynote address from Christiana Figueres (the
former Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change).
We also develop products for the circular and bio-based
economy to further reduce scope 3 emissions. See
'Stakeholder engagement' on page 145 and 'Resource
scarcity / Circular economy' elsewhere in this chapter.Avoided emissions
Brighter Living Solutions can have benefits at any stage in the
value chain. Avoided emissions refers to the emissions-related
environmental benefits that occur downstream in the use
phase of our products
For example, DSM Engineering Plastics supply products into
the automotive industry, where they replace metals and other
materials to achieve weight savings. These weight savings
reduce vehicle fuel consumption and associated greenhouse
gas emissions. Products sold in 2018 to this market will avoid
the emissions of approximately 806 kt CO 2eq over the average
lifespan4 of the vehicles.
VevoVitall® is one of our many solutions in animal nutrition, a
eubiotic added to pig diets that delivers proven benefits
including improved feed conversion and increased weight
gain. This reduces feed intake, one of the largest contributors
to the environmental impact of pig farming, which reduces
emissions. In 2018, sales of VevoVitall® avoided an estimated
emission of 263 kt CO 2eq.

Although we already achieved our 2020 target in 2017, we
continued our efforts to reduce air emissions in 2018,
consistent with our sustainability values. For example, a large
project to reduce VOC emissions at our largest manufacturing
site in Jiangshan (Jiangsu Province, China) was implemented
during the second half of the year. This VOC treatment system
targets an above-90% reduction in VOC emissions at this site.
Resource scarcity / Circular economy
While valuable materials are leaking away from our economy,
the Earth's resources are finite and there is a growing pressure
on the availability of those resources. Meeting the needs of
current and future generations in a way that is sustainable for
people and the planet requires moving away from a linear to a
circular use of resources. That is why we are committed to
securing the future availability of natural resources and
unlocking more value from the limited resources available. By

Resources & Circularity are a key part of Strategy 2021. We
aim to take sustainability into consideration at every stage in
the value chain, by embedding circular & bio-based thinking
into our sourcing, operations, innovation and portfolio, and
enabling 'closed loop' solutions through advocacy and
partnerships. Our scientific expertise and innovative power are
helping us develop materials that have a wider environmental
and societal impact.
We are enabling the transition toward a circular & bio-based
economy by:
- Reducing the use of critical resources over the value chain
- Replacing scarce, hazardous, and potentially harmful
resources with safe and renewable alternatives
- Extending the lifetime of products with improved durability
or shelf-life
- Designing for recyclability
- Recovering waste streams by viewing waste as a resource
Renewable raw materials
DSM believes that the use of sustainable resources is an
essential step in securing future resource availability but that it
also has environmental benefits in reducing the ecological
footprint. The renewable raw materials we use include waste
from agriculture, yeasts and enzymes, carbohydrates and
natural oils and acids. In 2018, the share of spend on
renewable raw materials decreased to 14.3% versus 15.4%
in 2017. The percentage decrease is due to product mixchanges, while the absolute amount is comparable to the
average of the past few years.
An example of our use of renewable raw materials is
EcoPaXX®, DSM's bio-based, high-performance polyamide
(PA410). It offers outstanding performance in the most
demanding of environments, including excellent chemical
resistance and low moisture absorption, combined with a very
high melting point (highest of all bio-plastics) and high
crystallization rate. EcoPaXX® is 100% carbon neutral from
cradle to gate: the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during
the production is offset by the amount absorbed in plant
growth, and in particular by Ricinus communis, the tropical
castor bean plant that makes up some 70% of EcoPaXX®. This
provides a perfect opportunity for manufacturers who want to
combine sustainability with performance.
Waste
Our definition of waste recycled is the percentage of total
waste related to normal operations that is recycled or, if this is
not possible, incinerated off-site with heat recovery. We pay
careful attention to meeting local waste management
legislation. Waste statistics are mainly influenced by volumes,
the product mix and improvement projects. We saw a small
decline to 83% recycled waste in 2018, having transformed a
former recycled waste stream into a product stream. The
progress is still in line with our ambition level of 80–90% in
2020.
Projects executed in 2018 include the implementation of a
landfill-reduction project at DSM Nutritional Products in
Mairinque (Brazil) — enabling an expected reduction of waste
to landfill of 0.9 kt per year — and a project at DSM Nutritional
Products in Dalry (UK), where an upstream waste stream was
repurposed to produce fertilizers. We are investigating the
possibilities for shifting a downstream waste stream, which
has already decreased in volume due to the upstream waste
initiative, away from landfill.
Water security
Water is essential to life. It is also essential to the viability of our
business, and we recognize that this precious resource will
come under increasing pressure in the face of climate change
and growing global demand. We are committed to measuring,
tracking and continually improving our water stewardship as
well as our position as a global sustainability leader within the
chemical sector. As part of this commitment, DSM is a
signatory to the CEO Water Mandate, a UN Global Compact
initiative that mobilizes business leaders to advance water
stewardship, sanitation, and the SDGs, in partnership with
governments, peer institutions, civil society, and others. In
2018, we received a B- rating from CDP for our water
governance and management strategy.

We recognize water management as integral to our risk
mitigation and environmental impact reduction strategies. We
believe that water risks are local by nature, and therefore focus
on local water risk assessments and thorough follow-up of
these. In 2018, we completed water risk assessments at
100% of our material water sites. The main water risks
identified related to water quality, changing local regulations
and limitations in local infrastructure. Risk exposure to water
scarcity was identified as very limited in the regions where we
operate. Mitigation actions were defined after the 2017 and
2018 risk assessments. In total, 34 actions were defined by
the end of 2018, of which seven were closed during 2018. The
remaining actions will continue in 2019.
To strengthen our water management efforts, a new corporate
water management standard — defined in line with the
Alliance for Water Stewardship standard and the UN Global
Compact CEO Water Mandate — was launched in 2018.
Implementation of this standard commenced at sites in water-
stressed areas as well as at material water sites.
Compared to 2017, our water consumption decreased to
22 million m3. This decrease was also helped by maintenance
stops at various manufacturing sites.
"Water security is a global issue that impacts billions of
people, from flooding and storms through to water
scarcity and drought. Water security is a material topic
for us that requires solutions addressing local water risks.
We report our progress on water security toward the UN
Global Compact CEO Water Mandate through this
report."
Feike Sijbesma, CEO/Chairman Managing Board
Our water pollution reduction programs aim to reduce total
water pollution, mainly by cutting Chemical Oxygen Demand
(COD). Total COD decreased from 2.5kt in 2017 to 2.2kt in
2018, helped by production shutdowns and investments to
improve our water treatment facilities.A new water treatment plant is under construction at DSM
Nutritional Products in Mairinque (Brazil). The project will
segregate all lines of domestic effluent, industrial effluent, and
rain water, and build containment tanks to store the effluents
on site. The domestic plant makes use of a natural
phytoremediation process (use of living plants to clean up soil,
air and contaminated water). The project represents a
significant step forward in terms of water security of supply
and water effluent treatment at the site.
Biodiversity
 2018 2017
Sites near high biodiversity 66% 61%
Biodiversity and healthy ecosystems are key conditions for a
sustainable world. Each year, we identify and monitor the
protected areas in the vicinity of our sites and the impact that
our activities have on these. Sixty-six percent of our sites have
been identified as being located in, or adjacent to, areas of
high biodiversity value. The increase compared to 2017 is due
to newly acquired sites in areas of high biodiversity and the
reclassification of areas surrounding certain existing sites as
areas of high biodiversity by (local) governments. For more
information, see 'Stakeholder engagement' on page 145 and
our position paper on Biodiversity on the company website.
Product stewardship
Product stewardship is an important aspect of our SHE and
sustainability strategies. The term refers to possible safety
risks and adverse effects on human or animal health and on
the environment that could be caused by our products, or the
substances present in them, throughout the value chain. It is
our responsibility to control and minimize these. Product
stewardship closely connects with the circular economy, as
products with zero or reduced hazardous properties will have
a higher potential for success in a circular economy.
We renewed our product stewardship commitments in 2018.
By the end of 2020, we will have assessed our full product
portfolio and will have an action plan for products with
Substances of Very High Concern (where the concentration is
above 0.1%). Substances in products that are considered
'essential for life' (i.e. that have a proven beneficial effect when
used at the officially recommended dose in nutritional and
pharmaceutical applications) are excluded from this
assessment. We take a risk-based approach and will use safer
alternatives where feasible, and always when required. For our
innovation portfolio, 'safe by design' is the leading principle in
the development of new and better products and processes.
For more information on product stewardship, see the
company website.Report by the Managing Board — Planet

Within the Profit dimension of DSM's Triple P approach, DSM
aims to deliver a sustainable financial return. This ensures
business continuity and allows the company to grow, while at
the same time providing shareholders the opportunity to invest
in a company whose purpose drives sustainable above-
market growth at higher returns.
We established and implemented our three-year strategic plan
for the period 2016-2018 called Strategy 2018: Driving
Profitable Growth  with two headline financial targets: high
single-digit percentage annual Adjusted EBITDA growth and
high double-digit basis point annual ROCE growth. To deliver
on these targets, we defined clear actions, including outpacing
market growth, cost reduction and efficiency improvements to
deliver € 250–300 million in cost savings versus the 2014
baseline, and making a continuous push for consistent
improvements in capital efficiency.
In support of our targets, we also adjusted our global
organizational and operating model to create a more agile,
commercially focused and cost-efficient company. We
refrained from large acquisitions and focused instead on
delivering value from the current portfolio and extracting value
from the monetization of our joint venture partnerships.
This chapter includes an overview of the key financial metrics
of the company and our performance in 2018.
In 2018, DSM delivered strong financial results again as we
significantly exceeded our financial targets. Our focus on
driving above-market sales growth, while pursuing cost and
efficiency improvement initiatives as well as maintaining capital
discipline, continued to deliver strong results in both Nutrition
and Materials.
In Nutrition, we benefitted from a temporary vitamin effect
caused by an exceptional supply disruption in the industry.
Adjusted for the total estimated temporary vitamin effect of
€ 415 million, our underlying organic growth was 6%
compared to 2017, with sales of €  8,852 million. Volumes were
up 3% from the previous year and above market growth. The
price growth of 3% was partly offset by a negative foreign
currency impact. The Adjusted EBITDA in the underlying
business was up 6% from 2017, to € 1,532 million. Adjusted
for currencies, the growth was 10%, above the high single-
digit growth target set with Strategy 2018. Strong EBITDA
growth in the business was also supported by our cost-
reduction and efficiency improvement programs.
DSM achieved run-rate cumulative gross cost savings of
about € 275 million by the end of 2018. In the underlying
business, Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) was up 100
basis point to 13.3%. Since the kick-off our successful Strategy 2018, ROCE is up 570 basis points versus end of
2015 (in the underlying business).
Our total sales increased by 7%, to €  9,267 billion (compared
to € 8,632 in 2017), including a total estimated € 415 million
temporary vitamin effect. The total Adjusted EBITDA was up
26% to €  1,822 million, benefiting from a total estimated €  290
million temporary vitamin effect. Our total ROCE was 16.8%,
up 450 basis points from 12.3% in 2017. Since the launch of
our successful Strategy 2018, our total ROCE was up 920
basis points.

Capital efficiency is a key driver of cash generation. One of our
key focus areas continued to be the improvement in our
working capital as percentage of total sales. At the end of
2018, total working capital was € 1,674 million, compared to
€ 1,499 in 2017. The average total working capital as aReport by the Managing Board — Profit
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  59 www.dsm.compercentage of sales was 18.7%, compared to 18.4% in 2017,
partly due to the temporary vitamin effect in Nutrition during
2018 and in line with our aspiration of 'below 20%'.
Innovation plays an important role in driving both top-line and
bottom-line growth. With 19% innovation sales in 2018 (in the
underlying business), which we define as sales from products
and solutions introduced in the last five years, we are delivering
against our ambitious aspiration of 20%. In 2018, DSM also
made progress on promising innovation projects that could
have a wider societal impact and drive future growth. These
include the Project Clean Cow, Veramaris®, fermentative
Stevia and Niaga®.
During 2018, DSM also extracted value with the sale of the
stake in DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals to Bain Capital.
DSM received € 271 million in cash following closing,
excluding an earn-out. Furthermore, DSM anticipates
receiving about €  200 million in cash relating to the divestment
of the Fibrant business by its associate ChemicaInvest (of
which €  120 million was received in 2018). During the strategic
period, we extracted significant value from our joint venture
partnerships Patheon, ChemicaInvest and DSM Sinochem
Pharmaceuticals. The combined proceeds of these
divestments were around € 3 billion.
Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA
Excluding the exceptional temporary vitamin effect influencing
the Nutrition business (mainly in Animal nutrition), organic
growth in the underlying business was 6%, driven by bothNutrition and Materials. Volume development accounted for a
3% increase, while price/mix had an 3% positive effect on
growth compared to 2017. Exchange rate fluctuations had a
negative impact of 4%. At € 9,267 million, total net sales in
2018 were 7% higher than in 2017 (€ 8,632 million), with
organic growth up by 11%.
Sales growth was strong among all regions, with favorable
high double-digit growth in Western Europe and single-digit
growth in North and Latin America. Sales were good in Latin
America and China, despite some temporary shutdowns in
Brazil and against a backdrop of economic uncertainty in both
regions.
Solid growth was achieved in China, India and Eastern Europe.
All high-growth economies together currently represent 43%
of DSM's sales in the underlying business (44% when Africa
is included), which is in line with 2017. The share of sales in
these economies as a proportion of DSM's total sales gives
us a well-balanced global footprint.
The Adjusted EBITDA in the underlying business was 6% up
compared to the prior year to € 1,532 million in 2018. Total
Adjusted EBITDA (Adjusted operating profit before
depreciation and amortization) increased by 26% or € 377
million, from €  1,445 million in 2017 to €  1,822 million in 2018.
Adjusted EBIT (Adjusted operating profit) rose from
€ 957 million in 2017 to € 1,345 million in 2018, up 41%.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  61 www.dsm.comNet profit
Net profit attributable to equity holders of DSM decreased by €  692 million to €  1,077 million. This decrease was mainly a result of
the higher Adjusted EBITDA (up €  377 million, including temporary vitamin effect), the sale of DSM's share in Patheon in 2017 (down
€ 1,250 million) and other differences in APM adjustments (up €  220 million), see below. Expressed per ordinary share, net earnings
(including temporary vitamin effect) amounted to € 6.10 in 2018 (2017: € 10.07).
Financial income and expense decreased by € 3 million year over year to € 101 million. Lower interest expenses were offset by
lower results on derivatives.
The reported effective tax rate over Adjusted taxable result 2018 was 17.4% (2017: 16.8%). This increase was mainly caused by
the one-off positive effect by the change in US tax rate in 2017.
Adjustments made in arriving at DSM's Alternative performance measures (APM adjustments)
Total APM adjustments for the full year amounted to a profit of € 45 million, consisting of a profit regarding associates and joint
ventures of €  122 million (mainly due to the gain of €  109 million on the sale of the shares of DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals), offset
by € 68 million in restructuring costs related to the ongoing cost-reduction programs, €  32 million of impairments and a related tax
benefit of € 23 million.

Cash flow provided by operating activities consists of the EBITDA for the year (€  1,754 million) less various cash-out items including
income tax of € 107 million and change in provisions of €  41 million, and changes in working capital of €  238 million. Our focus on
cash flow resulted in a full-year operating cash flow of € 1,391 million, which is 40% higher than 2017, mainly due to the increase
in EBITDA. Corrected for the temporary vitamin effect, the cash from operating activities amounted to €  1,126 million, an increase
of 13%. See also 'Consolidated financial statements' on page 158.
The cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures (€  673 million) and additions to fixed term deposits (€  322 million),
partly offset by the sale of the shares in DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals (€ 271 million) and the repayment of loans granted to
ChemicaInvest (€ 163 million).
The cash used in financing activities consisted mainly of dividend paid (€ 225 million) and repurchase of shares (€ 236 million).
For the full cash flow statement, see 'Consolidated cash flow statement (Note 26)' on page 169.
Balance sheet
The balance sheet total (total assets) reached € 13.6 billion at year-end (2017: € 12.8 billion). Equity increased by € 750 million
compared to the position at the end of 2017. This increase was mainly due to the net result of 2018. Equity as a percentage of
total assets increased from 55% to 57%.
Compared to year-end 2017, net debt decreased by € 629 million to € 113 million. The gearing at year-end was 1.4%, a further
decrease compared to 9.5% at year-end 2017.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  62 www.dsm.comCapital expenditure on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment amounted to €  653 million in 2018 (€ 646 million on a
cash basis), which was 37% higher than the level of amortization and depreciation in support of the high organic growth.
Total working capital amounted to € 1,674 million compared to € 1,499 million at year-end 2017, which represents 19.0% as a
percentage of annualized fourth quarter 2018 sales (2017: 17.2%), below our aspiration of 20%. Cash-wise, the operating working
capital (OWC) increased by € 246 million, mainly related to organic growth. OWC percentage increased from 22.3% at year-end
2017 to 24.2% of annualized sales at year-end 2018.
Cash and cash equivalents came to € 1,281 million at the end of the year; including current investments, this amounted to
€ 2,558 million (2017: € 1,853 million). Besides the regular cash flow, this increase was mainly attributable to the sale of our share
in DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals and the repayment of the loans granted to ChemicaInvest.

In Nutrition, we benefited from a temporary vitamin effect
caused by an exceptional supply disruption in the industry.
Adjusted for the total estimated temporary vitamin effect of
€ 415 million (mainly in Animal Nutrition & Health), our
underlying organic growth was up 7% compared to 2017, with
€ 5,722 million sales. Volumes were up 4% from the previous
year and above-market growth. The price growth of 3% was
partly offset by a negative foreign currency impact. Conditions
were good across most regions and market segments in
2018. The Adjusted EBITDA from underlying business was up
6% from 2017, to € 1,117 million. The Adjusted EBITDA
margin from underlying business was 19.5%, versus 18.9%
over 2017.
Total Nutrition sales increased by 10%, to € 6,137 million
(compared to € 5,579 million in 2017), including a total
estimated € 415 million temporary vitamin effect. The total
Adjusted EBITDA was up 34% to € 1,407 million, benefiting
from a total estimated € 290 million temporary vitamin effect.
Over the strategic period, Nutrition continued to deliver on its
aspired above-market growth ambition and further leveraged
our unique global products & local solutions business model,
supported by marketing and sales excellence and customer-
led innovation.

The world is facing an increasing number of food-related
health issues and challenges. According to the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than 800 million people
go hungry to bed each night. The International Food Policy
Research Institute (IFPRI) estimates that approximately two
billion, meanwhile, suffer from hidden hunger — meaning that
their diet lacks sufficient micronutrients such as vitamins and
dietary minerals. IFPRI additionally puts the number of adultsReview of business — Nutrition
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  67 www.dsm.comand children who are obese or overweight at more than 2.3
billion.
With our nutritional solutions, we are well positioned to actively
combat malnutrition in all its forms: undernutrition, hidden
hunger, overweight, obesity and the double burden of
malnutrition (the coexistence of undernutrition with overweight
and obesity), as well as diet-related non-communicable
diseases. We have established numerous partnerships in this
field, including those with WFP, UNICEF, Vitamin Angels and
World Vision. We are also addressing malnutrition through the
humanitarian organization Sight and Life  and our dedicated
Nutrition Improvement business segment — specialized in
supplementation programs and fortification of staple foods
and therapeutic or emergency foods with essential vitamins
and minerals in developing countries.
We are also addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
through our broad portfolio of nutritional products, including
our eubiotics.
Finally, with our nutritional solutions, we play an important role
in helping to repair the world's food systems. This is essential,
as we are witnessing the transgression of several planetary
boundaries in the agri-food sector.
Whereas earlier generations struggled primarily with the threat
of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, cholera and
plague, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are now the
number one cause of death worldwide, accounting for 70% of
all mortalities. These include cardiovascular disease, type 2
diabetes and cancer. Research increasingly identifies
unhealthy and/or unbalanced diets as a major contributor to
many NCDs. Intermediate indicators that can be related to an
increased risk of NCDs are elevated levels of markers such as
increased blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI) and high
blood glucose. Balanced nutrition plays a role in keeping these
indicators at healthy levels, hence helping to reduce the risks
of NCDs. Besides solutions to reduce sugar and salt in
processed foods, we also produce OatWell®, a nutritional
ingredient that harnesses the scientifically-proven health
benefits of oat beta-glucan to reduce cholesterol levels.
WHO predicts that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is expected
to overtake NCDs by 2050 as the world's leading cause of
death. WHO defines AMR as the ability of a micro-organism
(such as bacteria, viruses, and some parasites) to stop an
antimicrobial (such as antibiotics, antivirals and antimalarials)
from working against it. AMR is on the increase due to the
over-prescription of antibiotics, the continued use of
antibiotics in some livestock farming operations, and the
release of antibiotics into the environment from
pharmaceutical factories. At DSM, we address the topic of
AMR and the responsible use of antibiotics in livestock
production through our broad portfolio of nutritional products,
such as our eubiotics for gastrointestinal functionality.Environmental scientists warn that we are on the verge of
going beyond the limits of several planetary boundaries if we
do not change our food system, risking people's livelihoods
and the ability to produce the food for all. These concern
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, biochemical flows, water
quality and quantity, land use, and biodiversity. The agri-food
sector is one of the major contributors to global GHG
emissions, and almost a third of wild fisheries are
overexploited. We work with customers and other
stakeholders to deliver more sustainable solutions that have
less impact on the environment, especially in Animal Nutrition
& Health. For example, our enzymes help animals improve
digestion and extract more nutritional value from feed. That
way, they still grow well even when they eat less. As a result,
fewer natural resources, such as land and water, are needed
for animal protein production.
Consumers are becoming increasingly selective about where
their food comes from and how it is produced. There is a
growing worldwide trend in favor of natural and plant-based
foods, including viable alternatives to animal-sourced foods
(meat, fish and dairy). Running counter to this trend, there is
also a simultaneous growth in global demand for animal-
sourced foods, with clear regional differentiation. We aim to
help consumers choose in favor of sustainably produced and
healthy nutrition by providing tasty, enjoyable food and
supporting initiatives. We also enable and produce sustainable
proteins, both animal- and plant-based.
Sustainability & Innovation
Sustainability is one of the key drivers of our Nutrition cluster.
Our nutrition businesses support many of the UN Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDGs 2, 3, 12 and 13. 
We are proud of our strategic partnership with the UN World
Food Programme (WFP), which we extended for another three
years. We have partnered with WFP since 2007 to develop
cost-effective, sustainable and nutritious food solutions for
those in need. In 2017, over 39.4 million people benefited from
improved nutrition through WFP. Thanks to our expertise in
nutrition and food fortification, WFP has improved its food
basket and developed more nutritious food products for
disadvantaged people around the world. These products
include Super Cereal and Super Cereal Plus (complementary
foods), ready-to-use supplementary foods, high-energy
biscuits, micronutrient powders such as MixMe™, and
fortified rice. We also provide funding for WFP's operations
and motivate employees to engage in fundraising campaigns
and awareness-raising initiatives for WFP's school meal
programs. Finally, we combine our strengths to put local
networks in place that ensure sustainable and increased
access to more nutritious food as an essential part of healthy
diets. Together, we are helping people survive and thrive.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  68 www.dsm.comIn addition to our work on hunger, malnutrition, health and
well-being, our innovations are increasingly focused on
improved sustainability throughout the product lifecycle and
the value this can bring to customers and society at large.
For example, in 2018 we introduced Balancius™, a broiler
feed ingredient that helps to facilitate digestion and the
absorption of nutrients from the diet. We also made significant
progress in Veramaris®, our joint venture with Evonik to
produce the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA from natural
marine algae as an alternative to fish-oil-based omega-3. In
2018, we also continued our work on Project Clean Cow to
develop a feed solution that helps reduce methane emissions
from cows by at least 30%. Methane is a potent greenhouse
gas that makes a significant contribution to climate change.
Ruminants such as cows are responsible for approximately
27% of anthropogenic methane emissions globally (see
'Animal Nutrition & Health' on page 70).
After a successful initial market introduction in North America
in mid-2018, we accelerated our large innovation project for
fermentative Stevia by establishing a joint venture with Cargill,
as announced last November. Stevia is a zero-calorie, cost-
effective sweetener that can substitute sugar in food and
beverages. In personalized nutrition, we announced a
strategic partnership with digital health company Mixfit and
became their largest shareholder. This collaboration unites our
expertise in micronutrients with Mixfit's proprietary
technology, creating the ability to analyze health data in real
time (see 'Human Nutrition & Health' on page 71).
Governments around the world are focusing increasingly on
the environmental footprint of their domestic industries. In
recent years, China in particular has tightened the
enforcement of its environmental regulations, also known as
its 'Blue Skies' policy. This policy addresses air, soil and water
pollution and sets significantly higher standards than before,
including those standards applicable to China's many small
and medium-sized vitamin manufacturers. The result is a more
level playing field for non-Chinese competitors versus these
manufacturers.
We have been a very reliable player in this market, able to
support customers through this period of uncertainty while at
the same time being a frontrunner in compliance. In 2018, we
invested € 50 million to upgrade our vitamin C facilities in
Jiangshan (Jiangsu Province, China), improving environmental
performance and enhancing worker safety. This commitment
goes beyond simply meeting legislative requirements to set
new sustainability standards, allowing brands that use our
products to make eco-friendly positioning claims. We are also
in the process of introducing a natural gas-fired plant, following
a strategic agreement on steam and electricity supply as part
of the province's aim of reducing the number of coal-fired
power plants to meet 2020 targets.Strategy
Our Nutrition cluster has unparalleled access to customers
thanks to our global network and our ability to customize
formulations for local markets, especially through our premix
solutions. This cluster is active in more than 60 countries. Our
strategy accelerates growth by focusing on four key areas:
- Expanding our core
- Adding new products and solutions
- Expanding in new segments and regions
- New business models
We have been expanding our core by adding new premix
facilities to our global network. Two new facilities for Animal
Nutrition & Health were opened in Peru and India in 2018, while
in Human Nutrition & Health we started the development in
Poland of the world's only premix site serving the maternal and
infant nutrition market exclusively.
In terms of adding new products and solutions, the launch of
Balancius™ represents a major breakthrough in animal
nutrition. Optimizing gastrointestinal functionality is crucial for
efficient feed utilization, for example in poultry farming. Many
other examples of new products and solutions can be found
throughout this chapter.
Expanding into new segments and regions is also a key part
of our Nutrition strategy. In 2017, we acquired BioCare
(Denmark) and added probiotics to our gut health offering. We
completed the integration of this business during 2018.
Our fourth growth area, new business models, mainly
represents our drive to move further down the value chain,
closer to consumers and farmers. A growing proportion of our
Human Nutrition & Health revenue now comes from custom
nutrient premixes, market-ready solutions and direct-to-
consumer products that address diverse health or lifestyle
benefits. For Animal Nutrition & Health we introduced an app
through which Chinese farmers and suppliers can place
orders, track inventories and monitor feed quantities, as well
as being able to check pork prices.
Across our nutrition businesses, we continue to work on
operational and commercial excellence. In 2018, we started a
program in DSM Nutritional Products to create a more
customer-centric and cross-functional organization. Our key
cross-functional capabilities, such as customer care and
supply chain, have been elevated and strengthened. We are
moving toward becoming more collaborative through new
ways of working. We have aligned customer-centric KPIs
across the organization. All of these measures result in tangible
business impact on key metrics, such as on-time in-full (OTIF),
delivery, speedy complaint handling (CIRT) and inventory
levels.Review of business — Nutrition
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  69 www.dsm.comFurthermore, we fully implemented our new market-segment
approach in Human Nutrition & Health (i.e. pharma, dietary
supplements, food & beverage, early life nutrition, medical
nutrition, nutrition improvement). In addition to the regional
geographic focus, these global market segments have been
designed to drive even greater customer intimacy and growth,
while at the same time providing insights to key innovation
needs for the future.
Within our Animal Nutrition & Health business we started a
similar improvement program in 2018, called acCElerate,
aimed at commercial excellence and amplifying the customer
experience.
At the start of 2018, our DSM Food Specialties business
adopted a customer-centric organizational structure,
switching from a product-led to a market-focused model for
our commercial operations.
In June 2018, we communicated our updated Strategy 2021.
More detail on our Nutrition strategy can be found in the
'Strategy 2021' chapter on page 22.
We take a balanced view of our business, and therefore as we
seize opportunities, we also manage risks. For more
information on how we manage risks, see 'Risk management'
on page 118.
DSM Nutritional Products
In 2018, an exceptional supply disruption in the industry
positively impacted our sales. We have estimated a temporary
vitamin effect of €  415 million additional sales, mainly in Animal
Nutrition & Health. Excluding this temporary vitamin effect, in
the so-called underlying business, we achieved organic
growth of 7%, with strong volumes, up 4% as well as price
growth of 3%, supported by good conditions across most
regions and market segments. DSM Nutritional Products had
total sales of € 5,647 million in 2018, including the estimated
temporary vitamin effect, a 12% increase compared to €  5,038
million in 2017.Animal Nutrition & Health
Highlights 2018
- Strong organic growth
- Launch of Balancius™, the world's first microbial
muramidase
-Expansion of premix network with new facilities in Peru
and India
- Integration of Dutch premixer Twilmij
- Creation of Veramaris® and construction of new
production site in Blair (Nebraska, USA)
In 2018, the Animal Nutrition & Health business benefited from
a total estimated temporary vitamin effect caused by
exceptional supply disruptions in the industry. In the underlying
business, organic growth was up 8% compared to the
previous year. Volumes were up 4% and prices were also up
4% from the previous year. Business conditions were
favorable in almost all regions. Sales to Brazil were softer due
to temporary shutdowns mainly driven by strikes in the second
quarter. Prices were supported by initiatives to mitigate higher
input costs of sourced ingredients and the impact of negative
foreign currencies, as well as by the effects of the 'Blue Skies'
policy in China.
We continued to benefit from our strategy of addressing a wide
range of species, as well as from our diversified global
presence, with our unique portfolio and forward-integrated
premix solutions.
Including the total estimated temporary vitamin effect, total
sales were €  3,134 million in 2018 compared to €  2,660 million
in 2017. This good growth was achieved against a tough
comparative year.
Animal Nutrition & Health serves the global feed industry with
innovative and sustainable nutritional solutions. A pioneer
since the earliest days of feed additives, we draw on the latest
science to provide a unique portfolio that runs from vitamins
through carotenoids to cutting-edge eubiotics and feed
enzymes. Population growth and rising incomes are driving
demand for animal protein. Our products help producers of
animal feed and meat, including farmers, to raise animals more
efficiently and sustainably.
Our swine business showed solid growth in 2018. The impact
of African swine flu was largely mitigated by growth in other
segments. Poultry also performed quite well compared to
2017. Higher consumption, driven by attractive prices and the
diversity of the end-products derived from poultry, was the
main driver for the poultry industry's growth.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  70 www.dsm.comOur gut health strategy continued to stimulate sales of
eubiotics for gastrointestinal functionality in 2018. Sales of
these products enjoyed strong growth for the second
consecutive year.
Our Crina® range of essential oils saw strong demand in key
markets in 2018. Crina® Poultry Plus was complemented by
the launch of Crina® Digest, a unique and cost-effective
combination of three essential oil compounds with a novel
controlled release technology. Crina® Poultry Plus is the
market-leading solution, combining a unique and
complementary blend of essential oil compounds with
nature's most efficient organic acid (benzoic acid), to modulate
the microbiota and stimulating the secretion of digestive
enzymes. Crina® Digest was introduced in EMEA and will be
expanded to other geographies over time.
In September, we announced the launch of Balancius™, a
major breakthrough in animal nutrition. Optimizing
gastrointestinal functionality is crucial for efficient feed
utilization, for example in poultry farming. Balancius™ is a
naturally occurring muramidase, an enzyme that removes
bacterial debris from the gut and significantly increases feed
efficiency and digestibility. Balancius™ is currently registered
for broilers in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Mexico, the US, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, South Africa and
Nigeria. Registration in the EU is to follow in 2019.
In the ruminant sector, the beef market saw significant growth
opportunities in the US, Eastern Europe, Asia, Argentina and
Brazil. In 2018, our core portfolio registered strong growth,
stimulated by the vitamins market and the reinforcement of our
positioning of Hy-D® in the vitamin D segment through the
recent approval of Hy-D® Ruminant in the US. Hy-D® is a
vitamin D3 metabolite that supports bone development,
muscle formation and immune response. Having been
successfully used in poultry and swine, it is now being
extended to ruminants.
The aquaculture business also showed strong growth in 2018,
driven by the continued increase of salmon consumption in the
end-markets.
In the pet food industry, the increasing trend to treat pets as
part of the family has driven up product standards through the
use of more expensive functional ingredients, which has
translated into higher pricing. Marketing and product labeling
trends are mirroring those observed in human nutrition and
consumer goods. These trends are driving growth in the US,
Europe, and Japan especially.
In terms of our regional presence, our business enjoyed strong
growth in Asia Pacific during 2018, led by South East Asia. In
October, we expanded our operations in India with the
opening of a second Animal Nutrition & Health premix plant in
Jadcherla (India). By opening this facility, we underline ourcommitment to meeting the global feed industry's need for
innovative and sustainable solutions. It testifies to our growing
global presence.
We saw continuous growth in China, with a strong focus on
digital solutions, driven by Chinese tech companies entering
the farming business.
In Latin America, we continued to invest in our premix network,
opening a new premix plant in Lurín, near Lima (Peru).
In EMEA, our biggest region, western Europe remained a solid
source of revenue, capitalizing on the integration of Twilmij.
Our business also enjoyed growth in southern Europe, with
increasing penetration in Northern Africa and a portfolio
expansion in the Middle East.
In North America, we captured the growth opportunities
created by the vitamins market.
In 2018, we launched a holistic multi-year transformation
program called acCElerate to further strengthen our market
position and sustain our organic above-market growth track-
record.
In 2018, we made significant progress in Veramaris®, our joint
venture with Evonik to produce the omega-3 fatty acids EPA
and DHA from natural marine algae as an alternative to fish-
oil-based omega-3. Norwegian salmon producer Lingalaks
AS has started to replace fish oil by feeding 50 percent of their
salmon a diet which includes omega-3 oil produced by
Veramaris®, in order to ensure greater sustainability and
differentiation of their products.
We also made good progress with Project Clean Cow, our
new, highly innovative, feed solution that reduces methane
emissions from cattle by more than 30%. We have
successfully gathered the data needed to apply for regulatory
approvals in our targeted launch markets for this project.

health and wellness company and subsidiary of DSM —
develops, markets and distributes branded products that
support health and wellness. Core categories include
probiotics, healthy aging, and urinary health.
Our increasingly customer-centric way of operating was a key
factor behind the growth of our sales during 2018. We
delivered this result via market-segment-focused, customer-
intimate, strategic market plans.
x“ In 2018, we once again
demonstrated our ability to
organically outgrow our
markets and further improve
our margins thanks to our
unique business model and
an increasing focus on
customer-centricity.  ”
Chris Goppelsroeder, DSM Executive Committee
and President & CEO DSM Nutritional Products
Our business is also moving closer to the consumer in the
value chain, focusing more intensely on the business-to-
consumer and personalized nutrition sectors. A growing
proportion of our revenue — more than 40% — now comes
from custom nutrient premixes, market-ready solutions and
direct-to-consumer products that address diverse health or
lifestyle benefits.Our collaboration with digital health company Mixfit to deliver
personalized nutrition solutions unites our expertise in
micronutrients with Mixfit's proprietary technology, creating
the ability to analyze health data in real time. In May, Mixfit
launched the prototype of its Intelligent Nutrition Assistant
(Mina). Mina analyzes a person's genetic makeup, diet, lifestyle
and health goals to create and dispense beverages containing
a customized mix of our vitamin and mineral Quali®-Blends
throughout the day. In July, we became Mixfit's largest
shareholder. The US launch of Mixfit is scheduled for the
second quarter of 2019.
In April, we made an investment in Tespo, a US-based start-
up that offers consumers a simpler way to take vitamins by
providing these in a pill-free, liquid format dispensed at home.
During the year, we also acquired a venturing stake in
Biomarker Labs. The Biomarker app streamlines health
information from practically any wearable, sensor, lab or health
app to measure any dietary supplement brand to tell what's
working, and what is not.
In August, we announced plans for the world's only premix
manufacturing facility created exclusively for the maternal and
infant nutrition market. Located in Buk (Poland) at our existing
premix site, the investment is expected to double production
output at the site within the next two years. The design
incorporates several advanced technologies that reflect the
specialist needs of the early life nutrition market.
Following the addition of probiotics to our gut health offering
via the acquisition of BioCare in December 2017, we
integrated this business. BioCare is now our probiotic expert,
providing a 360-degree experience to customers.
Personal Care & Aroma Ingredients
Highlights 2018
-Above-market growth in both personal care and aroma
ingredients
-Implementation of new business unit strategy based on
three key growth drivers
- Launch of new innovations in skin and sun care
Sales were € 382 million in 2018, from € 353 million in 2017,
up 8%, with very strong 11% organic growth, partly offset by
3% less favorable currencies. All personal care product lines,
including sun, skin and hair care, delivered good above-
market growth, while aroma ingredients performed very
strongly in 2018. Successful commercialization of the
innovation pipeline further contributed to a very good year for
the business.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  72 www.dsm.comPersonal Care & Aroma Ingredients offers solutions for
customers in the personal care, home care and fine fragrance
markets. Our extensive portfolio includes aroma ingredients,
vitamins and natural bio-actives, as well as UV filters, peptides
and polymers. Our solutions support the health and beauty
needs of an aging population with various skin and hair types
around the world, and address increasing concerns around
global public health issues such as air pollution and skin
cancer.
Building on strong growth during 2017, we enjoyed continued
growth in both personal care and aroma ingredients in 2018,
outpacing the market across all segments. Leveraging three
main growth drivers — strategic initiatives in core segments,
commercialization of our innovations, and external
partnerships — we implemented our new business unit
strategy during 2018. Underpinned by a heightened focus on
operational excellence and sustainability, this strategy aims to
further accelerate our growth.
In 2018, we launched BEL-EVEN™, a patented synthetic
molecule that helps counteract the damaging effects of stress
on skin by inhibiting the enzyme that generates cortisol in the
skin. We also unveiled new research on SYN®-HYCAN, a
patented cosmetic tripeptide with scientifically proven
volumizing and firming benefits for all key facial zones.
We also introduced a new grade of vitamin B3 —
Niacinamide PC, guaranteed to contain less than 100 ppm
residual nicotinic acid, making it exceptionally well
tolerated. Proprietary research by DSM revealed that it could
prove to be a powerful ally in the latest challenges facing the
beauty industry: environmental pollution and ubiquitous blue
light.
In line with our long-term commitment to transparency, we
obtained well-known certifications such as COSMOS and
NATRUE, and more than 45% of DSM's portfolio is of natural
origin according to the recently introduced ISO 16128
standard on definitions for natural ingredients. To address the
growing interest in natural products, we launched DSM's
House of Naturals — an easy-to-use navigation aid that offers
customers clarity about the degree of natural origin in our
ingredients. Almost half of our Personal Care & Aroma
Ingredients portfolio is of natural origin, and more than 70% of
our skin care actives have a natural origin content in excess of
90%.DSM Food Specialties
Highlights 2018
- Good sales growth in hydrocolloids, enzymes and
cultures
- New product introductions supporting health &
wellness trends
- Growth in beverages and solutions for cheese
- Announcement of joint venture with Cargill to bring
zero-calorie, cost-effective sweeteners to market
faster
In 2018, total sales were 9% lower compared to 2017, due to
the deconsolidation of Yantai Andre Pectin and negative
currency effects. Good sales growth rates in hydrocolloids,
enzymes and cultures were partly offset by soft sales in savory
ingredients as a result of capacity limitations early in the year
that prevented the business from fully capitalizing on the
positive market conditions. This resulted in overall organic
growth of 1%.
DSM Food Specialties is a leading global supplier of specialty
food enzymes, cultures, probiotics, bio-preservation
solutions, hydrocolloids, savory ingredients, and solutions for
sugar reduction. Our ingredients and solutions are widely used
to create a broad range of food products, from grocery
favorites like yogurt, cheese and soups to specialized
products including gluten-free bread and beer, meat
substitutes, lactose-free milk, and sugar-reduced beverages.
Demand for our products is driven by five main market trends:
sugar reduction, enhanced taste experience, improved health
and wellness, bio-preservation, and food chain efficiency. With
nearly 150 years of experience in biotechnology and
fermentation for the food industry, we aim to enable better
food for everyone, helping make existing diets healthier and
more sustainable, and giving increasing numbers of people
around the world access to affordable, quality food.
At the start of 2018, we adopted a customer-centric
organizational structure at DSM Food Specialties, switching
from a product-led to a market-focused model for our
commercial operations. This aims to make us better aligned
with customers and their needs in the dairy, baking,
beverages, and savory industries we serve.
In dairy, we introduced Maxilact® Smart, the fastest-acting
lactase enzyme on the market. Boosting throughput speeds
enables customers to improve their efficiency in producing
lactose-free or reduced-sugar products, for which consumer
demand is growing worldwide. In support of the trend towardReview of business — Nutrition
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  73 www.dsm.comclean labels and away from chemical preservatives, we made
our core range of cheese enzymes completely benzoate-free.
In baking, legislation in Europe imposed benchmark levels of
acrylamide in baked goods and snacks due to health
concerns. This drove demand for our PreventASe® enzyme,
which we supported with the introduction of PreventASe® XR,
a solution created to deliver improved efficacy in applications
such as corn chips, biscuits and crackers.
One of the important trends underpinning our good
performance in beverages is the drive by many of the world's
leading brewers to reduce their environmental footprint, in
particular to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Our enzymatic
solutions — including Brewers Clarex® and Brewers
Compass®, which enable significant energy savings — are
consequently in high demand.
Solutions such as ModuMax™ enable food and beverage
producers to deliver an enjoyable taste experience in low-
sugar, low-salt, and low-fat applications by creating a fuller
mouthfeel and masking negative off-notes. Customer traction
for this innovative taste modulator continued to grow during
2018.
One of our major innovation programs over recent years has
been the development of fermentation-derived steviol
glycosides — the sweet-tasting, zero-calorie molecules from
the stevia plant. After a successful initial market introduction
in North America in mid-2018, we accelerated our large
innovation project for fermentative ‘Stevia' by establishing a
joint venture with Cargill, announced in November. Stevia is a
zero-calorie, cost-effective sweetener that can substitute
sugar in food and beverages.
Another growth platform in specialty food ingredients is
hydrocolloids — thickeners and stabilizers that dissolve,
disperse or swell in water to provide a broad range of
important functionalities and physical attributes including
gelling, texture, mouthfeel, viscosity and suspension. Demand
for hydrocolloids, especially our natural hydrocolloids, is driven
by three underlying consumer trends:
- The quest for convenient foods and beverages
- Consumers' increasing demand for dairy- and plant-based
protein drinks
- The trend toward clean labeling
Our hydrocolloids are primarily delivered in the form of pectin
and bio-gums. Both are used as gelling and stabilizing agents
in a variety of foods and beverages. Our natural hydrocolloids
are enjoying strong sales growth.
In July 2018, we restarted production in DSM Rainbow
Biotechnology (DRB), a company in which we acquired a
majority equity stake in September 2017, thereby furtherincreasing our gellan gum capabilities and expanding into
other bio-gums such as xanthan and welan. Following the
completion of the transaction, the site was shut down so that
we could execute a series of upgrades to improve its safety,
health, quality and environmental standards. With these
investments, DRB will substantially improve the robustness of
its operations, as well as the reliability and quality of its
products and supply. DRB in future will work closely with our
other bio-gums site, DSM Zhongken Biotechnology, as well
as with the new Innovation Center, both in Tongxiang (Zhejiang
Province, China).

Meeting growing 
demand for  
sustainable 
animal protein
As the world’s population grows, global demand for poultry 
meat is on the increase. With the global population projected 
to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, it is anticipated that 470 million 
tons of meat will need to be produced each year, much of it 
from broiler chickens.
At the same time, consumers are looking for high-quality, 
aff  ordable animal protein and sustainably produced food, 
as part of a healthy and balanced diet. Farmers are therefore 
seeking ways to increase eﬃ   ciency while reducing the 
environmental impact of their operations and also ensuring 
animal health and welfare.
These challenges require game-changing nutritional 
solutions. Traditionally, livestock farmers have used 
interventions including medication that target living bacteria 
in the gut, either modulating their population or killing them. 
Our new feed ingredient Balancius™ – the latest innovation 
from our industry-leading Alliance with Novozymes – takes a 
diff  erent approach by targeting dead bacteria in the gut.
A unique, proprietary, patented technology, Balancius™ is 
the fi  rst and only microbial muramidase (an enzyme that 
breaks down the bacterial cell wall fragments) to do this. 
Supplementing the broiler diet with Balancius™ improves 
digestion and nutrient absorption, thus helping farmers to 
get more from their feed and also to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
    “Together, DSM and Novozymes have developed a solution 
that contributes to the growth and welfare of animals by 
removing bacterial cell debris from the chicken’s gut. No 
other technology works like this,” says Susanne Palsten 
Buchardt, Vice President at Novozymes for Animal Health 
& Nutrition Commercial. “It’s a game-changing innovation 
based on our 20-year Alliance with DSM.”
Purpose
Adding Balancius™ to the diet of a broiler ﬂ  ock numbering 
one million birds saves potentially 125,000 kg of feed. Using 
Balancius™ in all broiler diets across Latin America and 
North America – the two regions where Balancius™ has 
been launched to date – could save an estimated 4.2 million 
tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.

Creating the 
foundations for 
health and 
well-beingReview of business — Nutrition
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  77 www.dsm.com
The diversity of the micro-organisms inhabiting the gut – known 
collectively as the microbiome – is an important foundation for a 
healthy life, playing a critical role in the development of a robust 
immune system. 
Consumer interest in gut health is on the increase. Probiotics are 
now taken by growing numbers of health-conscious consumers to 
support the immune system, digestive health, and even newer areas 
such as mental health. 
Many health conditions, including intestinal disorders and obesity, 
are characterized by an imbalance in, or impairment to, the 
microbial colonies that inhabit the gut. Clinical studies suggest that 
the consumption of probiotics can help balance the microbiome, 
combating the adverse eff  ects of these conditions. 
Our Nutrition business is widely present in the gut health value chain. 
We make ingredients (such as probiotics, digestive enzymes and 
vitamins), develop market-ready customized solutions (through our 
recently acquired and fully integrated probiotic expert BioCare), and 
deliver end-to-end business-to-business services for owners of 
consumer brands, from initial concept to fi  nished product. 
“We are distributing supplements and medical device products 
from BioCare,” states Karl Parance, CEO at Laboratoire Immubio. 
“BioCare has proven to be a highly reliable, supportive and 
competent partner in all spheres of interaction. Thanks to their 
profound expertise and innovative capabilities, we have enjoyed very 
strong growth within the probiotic market.”
At DSM we also own the Culturelle® and up4® consumer brands, 
which form a part of our i-Health division. i-Health – a global 
consumer health and wellness company and a subsidiary of DSM 
– develops, markets and distributes branded products that support 
health and wellness, including digestive health and immunity. 
Culturelle® is the world’s number one probiotic brand, trusted for 
the safe and eff  ective contribution it makes to digestive, immune, 
and overall health and well-being. Culturelle® meets the needs 
of consumers from babies to adults, and is the probiotic most 
frequently recommended by pediatricians and pharmacists.
Purpose
Our experience and expertise allow us to develop a wide range 
of gut health solutions to help microbiome diversity, which is a 
foundation for a healthy life. 
Performance Driven
The market for probiotic products is growing by 7–8% annually. The 
value-adding inclusion of probiotics in mainstream foods, beverages 
and nutritional supplements presents attractive opportunities for us 
as an integrated supplier of ingredients to consumer brands.Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  78 www.dsm.com
Personalized 
Nutrition in 
the digital age 
Vitamins, nutritional lipids and minerals are essential for 
human health and well-being. However, most people 
worldwide do not meet the recommended intake levels. 
Also, more and more people are being diagnosed with 
diseases that are largely preventable by a balanced and 
nutritious diet. In the face of this trend, personalized nutrition 
off  ers consumers tailored nutrition and advice that may be 
more benefi  cial than mass-produced solutions.  
As a trusted authority on nutrition science and a leader in 
research on the role of micronutrients in human health, 
we partner with companies that possess the capabilities to 
create easy-to-use personalized nutrition solutions. In 2018, 
we entered into several such partnerships. Here we focus on 
two highlights.
The fi  rst is with digital health company Mixfi  t, creator of the 
fi  rst ever in-home, connected personalized nutrition device to 
provide consumers with a convenient, tasty, daily beverage 
customized to their needs. This contains an individually 
blended mix of our vitamin and mineral Quali®-Blends.  
“Consumers need to feel that the solution fi  ts into their lives,” 
observes Reza Zanjani, CEO of Mixfi  t. “And it has to show 
that what they are consuming is improving their health.”The second is with Macuwell™, a supplier of eye health 
solutions to opticians in Germany. Eye health education – 
based on fast, accurate diagnostic measurements – is key 
to a high-quality consultation. Macuwell™ helps opticians 
improve eyecare standards by off  ering Macular Pigment 
Optical Density testing and providing eye health nutritional 
supplements and protective eyewear. At DSM, we have a 
range of ingredients benefi  cial to eye health. Together with 
Macuwell™, our Nutrition Academy has developed live 
training, e-learning videos and tutorials to support opticians. 
Purpose
Our partnerships in personalized nutrition help individuals 
take responsibility for their health, reducing their exposure to 
a wide range of non-communicable diseases and helping to 
lower healthcare costs. 
Performance Driven
Various estimates project annual double-digit growth for the 
personalized nutrition segment. Strong consumer pull and 
the rapid evolution of enabling technologies are fueling this 
trend. Review of business — Nutrition

Omega-3 rich in 
EPA and DHA 
from natural 
marine algae
Fish is an important source of nutrition. Three billion people 
today rely on marine fi  sh for food. Oily fi  sh – and especially 
salmon – is also a rich source of the two essential omega-3 
fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are vital for brain, eye and 
heart health. 
Spiraling demand for seafood and the consequent 
pressure on overfi  shing has fueled the growth of fi  sh farms. 
Aquaculture, however, compounds the burden on wild fi  sh 
stocks, since 20% of the wild catch is used to make feed for 
farmed fi  sh and 75% of all fi  sh oil produced is currently fed 
to farmed fi  sh. In response to a limited, fi  nite availability of 
fi  sh oil along with soaring demand for seafood, the level of 
omega-3 EPA and DHA fatty acids in salmon has declined 
by more than a half over the past decade. This development 
is not supportive for consumers looking for a healthy food 
option. 
DSM and Evonik have joined forces to create Veramaris® and 
developed the technology to produce high-quality omega-3 
from the natural marine algae which are part of the marine 
food chain. Through this technology, we are able to reduce 
the aquaculture industry’s reliance on the world’s fi  nite fi  sh oil 
resources for these vital omega-3 fatty acids. Veramaris® is 
a sustainable alternative source of omega-3 fatty acids rich 
in both EPA and DHA. One ton of Veramaris® algae-based 
omega-3 oil provides the equivalent amount of omega-3 
EPA and DHA to that of 60 tons of wild-caught fi  sh.In June 2018, Veramaris® held a topping-off   ceremony for 
its new production facility in Blair (Nebraska, USA). While 
pilot quantities are available now from two sites, commercial 
quantities of algal oil are scheduled for delivery to customers 
in 2019. 
Purpose
By including algal oil containing EPA and DHA in fi  sh 
feed, we help to conserve wild fi  sh stocks and enable the 
aquaculture industry to grow sustainably. 
Performance Driven
The Veramaris® plant’s initial annual production capacity 
will meet approximately 15% of the salmon industry’s total 
current yearly demand for omega-3 EPA and DHA fatty 
acids.Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  80 www.dsm.com
A sweet deal for 
sugar reduction
One of the most signifi  cant transformations in the global 
food and beverage sector today is the drive to reduce sugar 
levels. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 
that no more than 10% of our total daily calorie intake 
should come from free sugars in order to reduce the risk of 
overweight, obesity and tooth decay. 
Obesity increases the risk of several non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs). According to WHO, 1.9 billion adults and 
nearly 400 million children and adolescents were overweight 
or obese in 2016, with the number of obese youngsters 
having increased tenfold in the past 40 years. 
In 2018, Cargill and DSM announced a 50:50 joint venture, 
Avansya, to rise to this challenge. Together, the companies 
will produce sweet-tasting, zero-calorie sweeteners such as 
the steviol glycosides Rebaudioside M and Rebaudioside D 
(Reb M, Reb D). Steviol glycosides occur in the sweet-
tasting leaves of the stevia plant. Avansya’s products will be 
produced by fermentation, a process using less land, water, 
and energy than extraction from stevia leaves. The products 
will be marketed under the brand name EverSweet™. 
Working together will leverage both companies’ highly 
complementary strengths to bring sugar reduction solutions 
to market faster and more eff  ectively.“The demand for sugar-reduction solutions is urgent, 
global, and growing fast,” says Chris Simons, Cargill Vice 
President Food Segment North America. “While consumers 
are searching out foods and beverages that help meet their 
dietary needs or goals, brand owners know that great taste 
can’t be compromised. By partnering with DSM, we can 
further advance a commercialized Reb M and Reb D product 
line that off  ers what consumers desire.”
Purpose
We are committed to enabling better food for everyone 
within planetary boundaries. Our ingredients and application 
know-how help food and beverage companies deliver better-
for-you versions of the products and brands consumers 
love, with less added sugar.
Performance Driven
The market for high-intensity sweeteners produced by 
fermentation is expected to exceed € 3 billion by 2025. 
Avansya is well positioned to secure a signifi  cant sales 
potential in this market. Review of business — Nutrition

Staying safe 
with sun 
protection 
Many consumers underestimate the power of the sun 
and are unaware of the protective powers of sunscreens. 
Moreover, they do not enjoy applying sun cream, nor do they 
like the feeling of having it on their skin. Consequently, many 
people in the world today are not receiving adequate sun 
protection.
Skin cancer rates have been increasing for decades. In the 
US, for instance, people have a 20% chance of developing 
skin cancer by the age of 65. In fact, every 53 minutes 
someone dies from skin cancer in the country.
Two main factors are contributing to the rise in skin cancer. 
One is that people do not apply sunscreen in suﬃ   cient 
quantities. The other is that they do not use sunscreens 
as regularly as they should. Skin cancer is preventable, 
however.
Our unique portfolio of UV fi  lters and sensory modifi  ers 
makes it easy for consumers to protect themselves against 
skin cancer. We off  er the industry’s broadest range of 
UV fi  lters – the active ingredients that prevent UV rays from 
penetrating the skin and causing damage. 
We have unparalleled expertise in formulating UV fi  lters to 
provide optimum UV protection. Our UV fi  lters go beyond the 
traditional boundaries of skin protection by tackling the blue 
light spectrum – a short-wavelength type of light that may accelerate skin aging. We also have the sensory modifi  ers to 
make sun products that feel light and pleasant on the skin.  
We work continually with our customers to create products 
that make sun protection more appealing as well as more 
eff  ective, so that they can become part of everyone’s daily 
routine.
Purpose
With our unique portfolio of UV fi  lters and sensory modifi  ers, 
we aim to make sunscreens more eff  ective and appealing 
to protect people against the suff  ering associated with skin 
cancer. 
Performance Driven
The global market for sunscreens was estimated at 
USD 10.5 billion in 2017. Research indicates that people 
who use sunscreens apply only a fi  fth of the recommended 
amount, meaning that the potential of this market is much 
greater. Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  82 www.dsm.com
Taking action on 
climate change 
together
Around the world, dairy and beef cattle are an important 
source of milk and protein. They are also an essential source 
of income for farmers and local communities. However, along 
with its clear nutritional and socio-economic benefi  ts, cattle 
farming also generates a substantial environmental footprint. 
In fact, an estimated 14.5% of all human-caused greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions come from livestock, with nearly 65% of 
this fi  gure originating from dairy and beef cattle.
A large proportion of livestock emissions come from enteric 
(burped) methane, as a result of the natural digestive 
processes of cows. Whereas the GHG carbon dioxide 
remains in the atmosphere for centuries, methane warms the 
planet far more quickly. Over a period of 20 years, the global 
warming potential of methane is an astounding 84 times 
higher than that of CO2.
Some years ago, we decided to take the lead in exploring 
practical solutions for reducing ruminant enteric methane 
emissions. After extensive research, our scientists came 
up with the answer. Through our Project Clean Cow, we 
have developed a proprietary feed supplement (3-NOP) 
that inhibits the enzyme which is responsible for producing 
methane in the rumen of the cow. Peer-reviewed studies by 
independent scientifi  c institutions have shown that 3-NOP 
has the ability to consistently reduce enteric methane by 
approximately 30% for dairy and beef cattle, if delivered at 
the recommended dose. Purpose
By helping to reduce the methane impact of cattle farming, 
we are also helping to solve the global sustainability challenge 
of how to supply consumers with suﬃ   cient animal protein in a 
way that minimizes harmful emissions. 
Performance Driven
Our solution is designed to help the dairy and beef value 
chain (farmers, cooperatives, brands and retailers) to lower 
their carbon footprint while also meeting growing consumer 
demand for sustainable products. In addition to preparing 
for the market introduction of the feed supplement, we are 
working with key players and inﬂ  uencers across the value 
chain to shape a more sustainable, low emission future. 
The potential market for innovative solutions like 3-NOP is 
estimated at € 1–2 billion.Review of business — Nutrition

Trends
The main growth drivers of our Materials cluster are
sustainability and changing societal needs.
The worldwide demand for more sustainable solutions is
redefining how these systems will operate in the future.
Advanced materials with ever higher performance levels will
be required across a wide range of applications.
For example, the future of transportation will require more
complex and higher-performing materials for emerging
autonomous, lightweight and more energy-efficient
automotive designs. Materials are also playing a role in
renewable energy generation and storage, 3D printing, more
sustainable packaging and advanced healthcare applications.
One example is the use of plastics in cars. In the 1950s,
plastics accounted for 1% of a car's weight. Today, they
represent nearly 12% of a car's weight. That percentage is
expected to grow to 15% by 2030, as designers and
engineers find an increasing number of applications in which
metal can be replaced by plastics.
At the same time, consumers are increasingly seeking 'smart'
connected and customized products and services that call for
new types of performance materials. For example, 3D printing
is disrupting the business value chain as its capabilities evolveReview of business — Materials
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  85 www.dsm.combeyond prototyping to embrace mass production. This new
technology is finding transformational applications in many
fields. The demands placed on healthcare systems are steadily
rising. Medical and technological advances, spiraling
complexity and the accelerating integration of electronics
combined create new performance requirements for materials
to be used both inside and outside the body.
In more and more industries, circular economy topics such as
recycling and the use of bio-based materials are receiving
increasing attention. For example, in Europe alone, the carpet
industry generates 1.6 million tons of carpet waste annually,
of which 60% ends up as landfill, 37% is incinerated and only
3% is recycled. Across the value chain, consumer sentiment
and regulatory pressure are driving a shift toward materials
designed for a circular economy — materials that are bio-
based, reusable, recyclable and bio-degradable.
Additionally, people everywhere are increasingly aware of
safety, including safe manufacturing and product safety. DSM
Engineering Plastics and DSM Resins & Functional Materials
offer solutions that eliminate or reduce the use of hazardous
substances in plastics and paints. The safety trend also
includes a greater focus on personal safety. Dyneema®
reduces the weight burden on people handling heavy weight
steel chains and wires. It is also ideal for applications in
protective apparel for sports, outdoor recreation, law
enforcement and first responders.Sustainability & Innovation
Increasingly, our innovation projects address solutions for a
more circular economy. DSM-Niaga technology, with which
we are enabling fully recyclable carpets, mattresses and
furniture components, is an excellent example. For more
information on Niaga®, see 'DSM Resins & Functional
Materials' on page 89.
At the same time, demand for renewable energy technologies
such as solar, wind and water are stimulating the development
of new performance materials. Several renewable energy
technologies contain Dyneema® as a key enabler, including
tidal and wind energy.
As an example of customer-centric cross-sector collaboration
and innovation, in 2018, DSM became a member of
ARENA2036 (Active Research Environment for the Next
Generation of Automobiles), the leading technology platform
for mobility in Germany. ARENA2036 is the initiator of
sustainable automotive engineering and automobile
production for the next generation of vehicles and a platform
in which both suppliers, customers and research institutes
participate.
Our DSM Materials Science Center, a cross-company
platform for state-of-the-art know-how, has led to a growth of

Dyneema® Force Multiplier Technology / Dyneema® UD (Uni-
Directional laminate), we enjoyed strong demand for
Dyneema® fiber during 2018.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  88 www.dsm.comWe have been investing in additional capacity to better serve
global customer demand. New production lines are being
added in the Netherlands as well as in the US, which will both
be fully on stream in 2019. In addition, we are investing to
expand the capacity of existing lines by incorporating the latest
technologies.
The year was also characterized by successes in the field of
sustainability, including partnerships for renewable energy
solutions with, for example, Ampyx (wind energy), Minesto
(tidal energy) and Principal Power (floating wind platform).
Other applications for Dyneema® include ropes that anchor
floating wind platforms to the seabed and ropes that connect
a tethered aircraft to a generator on the ground to generate
airborne wind energy.
We are a partner of The Ocean Cleanup, an ambitious mission
to rid the world's oceans of plastic. The Ocean Cleanup
launched its first barrier for testing in September 2018. We
make our facilities, knowledge, and networks available to our
partners in this initiative, and also supply our Dyneema® fiber,
an excellent material for tough marine environments.
Applications made with Dyneema® already deliver the lowest
carbon footprint for the performance specified from cradle to
grave compared to other materials, and we are committed to
further improve on this. Our plants in Greenville (North
Carolina, USA), and Heerlen (Netherlands) already use 100%
electricity from renewable sources.
DSM Resins & Functional Materials
Highlights 2018
- Very good performance in functional materials
business, 2% organic growth overall
- New applications for Niaga® launched with partners
Auping and ECOR
- Sustainability efforts in developing waterborne
coatings and inks recognized by partners
DSM Resins & Functional Materials reported sales of € 1,053
million in 2018 compared to € 1,045 million in 2017. DSM
Resins & Functional Materials faced a gradual slow-down in
the building and construction markets in 2018, resulting in 2%
organic growth for the year. In the fourth quarter, we saw some
destocking, especially in powder coating resins. Functional
Materials delivered another very good year, reflecting strong
demand for these high-margin materials used in data
infrastructure.
We are a global leader in the development and production of
waterborne, UV and powder coating resins. These productsoffer clear sustainability advantages over solvent-borne resins
traditionally used in paints and coatings. In functional
materials, we are the global leader in fiber-optic coatings. In
additive manufacturing (3D printing), we offer highly efficient
and effective prototyping technologies which help the industry
accelerate the pace at which new products are designed and
brought to market.
Our fiber optics business grew significantly compared to the
previous year, driven by the continuing rapid expansion of fiber
optic networks, while our packaging coatings and inks
business exhibited mid single-digit growth.
Together with our customers and value chain partners, we are
helping to build a more sustainable future. As legislation
continues to drive down the use of harmful substances such
as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), our growth comes
from anticipating changing end-user preferences and offering
innovative waterborne, powder and UV resins to replace
solvent-borne products. In addition, we aim to reduce our
carbon footprint in all our own activities, and in the raw
materials we purchase. Our resins give our customers the
opportunity to develop safe and low-carbon footprint
alternatives to mainstream solutions. For example, we are
developing circular economy alternatives to traditionally
manufactured carpets and mattresses to help combat the
growing global problem of landfilling with our Niaga®
technology.
Niaga® carpet solutions have been extended beyond 100%
polyester materials to create a fully recyclable DUO carpet. The
proprietary Niaga® adhesives enable separation of raw
materials into their separate material streams at the end of
each useful life. Fifteen pilot projects have been installed
featuring Niaga® carpet and rug solutions throughout Europe.
Niaga® design philosophy is being applied to categories
beyond carpet, as showcased in two product collaborations.
Together with Royal Auping, DSM-Niaga has redesigned
mattresses for circularity, with the first 100 mattresses under
evaluation. DSM-Niaga and ECOR have successfully
produced laminated panels combining ECOR's cellulose fiber
converting technology and Niaga® adhesive and lamination
tools. The first laminated panels for furniture, desk and building
applications were produced in the fourth quarter.
We intensified our focus on 3D printing in 2018 by establishing
a dedicated business unit for Additive Manufacturing, which
includes stereolithography, digital light processing, fused
filament fabrication, selective laser sintering, multi-set fusion,
ink jet and binder jet processes. By combining these
technologies, we are better able to harness the potential of this
fast-developing market.
The new Additive Manufacturing unit addresses four market
segments — healthcare, transportation, sports and lifestyle,Review of business — Materials
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  89 www.dsm.comand electronics — and cultivates partnerships with major
players in the value chain. In 2018, partnerships were
announced with Ultimaker and Chromatic 3D Materials,
among other companies. We also launched a 100% recyclable
filament, which offers a unique combination of extreme
flexibility and prolonged high-temperature resistance for the
3D printing of demanding industrial and end-use applications.
In January 2018, we launched a special series of resins,
Skins®, introducing a new element for graphic and packaging
design: touch. These resins enable a wide range of feel
opportunities for food and non-food packaging irrespective of
the substrate — coated or uncoated paper, board, plastics or
aluminum. As such, these surfaces can be transformed into
packaging that gains sensory attention and positively affects
consumer behavior.
In April 2018, we joined forces with Dynaplak to create a joint
venture (DSM-Amulix) in bio-based and biodegradable seed
protection to develop the next generation of seed protection
coatings. Currently most seeds are covered with conventional
non-degradable coating systems which contribute to the
growing problem of microplastics in the environment. DSM-
Amulix's seed coating solutions, by contrast, are safe, high-
performing, and rapidly biodegradable.
Driven by our strong sustainability focus, we developed our
partnership with PPG Industries. By integrating our plant-
based resin platform Decovery® with PPG's proprietary
technology, we have helped to develop a paint that purifies
indoor air and removes formaldehyde. In 2018, we extended
the scope of our collaboration and further optimized this
technology in line with customer demands.
Another key collaboration development in 2018 was our
partnership with Hewlett-Packard. We were chosen to
develop next-generation waterborne digital printing inks and
paperboard because of our recognized sustainability agenda.
Meanwhile in China we saw the positive effects of the 'Blue
Skies' policy initiative to substitute solvent-borne coatings for
waterborne coatings in sea container protection. Our
waterborne coating solution is unique as its corrosion
resistance outperforms the current solvent-based systems
and reduces VOC emissions by almost 90%. Together with
our partner Sherwin Williams, we control a meaningful share
of the container coating business in China.

Fully recyclable 
carpets and 
mattresses
Most of the bulkiest waste items in the world are made of 
complex combinations of materials glued together so as 
not to come apart. Mattresses, carpets and furniture, for 
example, eventually end up in landfi  ll or else have to be 
incinerated as they cannot be recycled.
Every year, some 4.5 billion square meters of carpeting are 
wasted. That is enough carpet to wrap a 100-meter-wide 
strip of it around the equator, every year. Also, more than 
50 million mattresses and a vast amount of furniture are 
wasted. In the US alone, carpeting consumes materials 
worth USD 6 billion annually. Exploring the potential benefi  ts 
of re-using these materials to make new carpets was the 
inspiration behind DSM-Niaga. 
Niaga®, which is ‘again’ spelled backward,  focuses on the 
redesign of everyday products for full recyclability. We develop 
manufacturing technologies which are based on a maximum 
of two materials per product and connected with a reversible 
glue. These high-quality materials have no negative health 
impact and are designed to be recycled locally. 
The purpose-led, circular-economy design thinking behind 
Niaga® has produced performance benefi  ts which extend 
beyond recyclability alone. For example, Mohawk Industries 
is using Niaga® Technology to manufacture its hypoallergenic 
and easy-to-clean Air.0 carpet, while Royal Auping has 
developed a modular, easy-to-maintain mattress made of 
Niaga® for the hospitality industry.  Jan-Joost Bosman, CEO at Royal Auping, comments, 
“At Auping we create comfortable sleeping solutions for 
now and the future. We invest in sustainability and have the 
ambition to organize all our business processes, products 
and services in a circular manner. DSM is the perfect partner 
for us to build further on current achievements, based on 
their material science and drive for innovation.”
Purpose
Niaga® is proving the advantages of circular thinking, not 
only by reducing landfi  ll and energy usage but also by 
improving consumer health.
Performance Driven
The combined global market for carpets and mattresses is 
currently worth USD 51 billion. These markets are expanding 
at compound annual growth rates of 1–2% and 3–4% 
respectively. Sustainable Niaga® technology targets the 
replacement of these products with ones made from fully 
recyclable materials.Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  92 www.dsm.com
A cleaner future 
for China’s 
shipping industry 
China produces the vast majority of the world’s shipping 
containers. These have traditionally been painted with 
solvent-borne coatings, which release volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs) that can be harmful.
As a top resin supplier to the waterborne paint market, we 
joined forces with other coatings players to form a collective 
called the Waterborne China Platform (WBCP). Chaired by 
DSM, WBCP’s mission is to help China’s coating industry 
make the transition to waterborne coatings, which contain 
up to eight times fewer VOCs than their solvent-borne 
equivalents.
As a result of this initiative, 99% of containers manufactured 
in China have been produced using waterborne coatings 
since April 2017. Annual VOC emissions have fallen by 
140 kt since then. By facilitating the adoption of this new 
technology, we are helping to keep the air clean for people 
today and generations to come.
Peter Pui, Chairman of WBCP and Regional Director Asia 
Pacifi  c-Specialty Coatings at DSM, comments, “Container 
manufacturers in China used to use VOC-containing 
solvents, which signifi  cantly contributed to the country’s 
air pollution problem. The establishment of the WBCP has 
enabled stakeholders to acknowledge the negative health 
eff  ects and climate impact of VOCs and to opt for more 
sustainable solutions.”Purpose
As a global leader in this fi  eld, we are helping the Chinese 
shipping industry to reduce annual VOC emissions by 
leading the transition to waterborne container coatings.
Performance Driven
Besides their use in the container industry, waterborne 
coatings have broad application uses in the fi  eld of furniture 
making and window frames. China’s coatings industry is the 
largest in the world. In 2017 alone, it used more than 
13 million tons of coatings, most of which were solvent-
borne, for a wide range of industrial applications. Review of business — Materials

Delivering 
sustainable 
mobility
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMS) are continuously 
looking for smart engine solutions to meet ever stricter 
automotive emissions standards. Our range of advanced 
engineering plastics with high heat and abrasion resistance 
and low friction helps our customers to reduce emissions 
from cars, combatting climate change while simultaneously 
complying with emission legislation.
For example, replacing just one metal component (the air 
intake manifold) with our Stanyl® Diablo can reduce CO2
emissions by one gram for every 10 km driven. 
This saving increases tenfold when Stanyl® is used for 
components to reduce friction in the combustion engine. 
Using Stanyl® for this purpose saves one gram CO2 per km 
driven. If every new car registered in Europe, traveling on 
average 15,000 km per year, used Stanyl®, this would deliver 
an annual CO2 emission reduction of approximately 225 kt.
To develop next-generation cars, OEMs have to re-imagine 
what is possible as two distinct industries converge − 
automotive and electronics, both of which we serve.  
Stanyl® has been specifi  ed for a wide range of automotive 
applications for three decades, while our materials are being 
used extensively in connections in mobile devices such as 
smart phones. “We have applied Stanyl® HGR2 PA46 in valve timing chain 
systems, which leads to lower friction, fuel economy savings 
and a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,” 
says Mr. Baddaria, Chief Engineering from BorgWarner.
Purpose
With Stanyl®, we show how product quality and durability 
can go hand in hand with environmental benefi  ts, making 
these an integral part of the value proposition. 
Performance Driven
Production of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles 
is growing by approximately 1 to 2% a year globally, while 
the use of engineering plastics in these vehicles is growing at 
approximately 5% a year.Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  94 www.dsm.com

In 2018, sales were up 2%, with 5% organic sales growth
largely offset by a weaker US dollar. DSM Biomedical volumes
were up, driven by strong sales in the drug delivery segment
in the second half of the year. DSM Advanced Solar reported
slightly lower volumes resulting from a slowdown in demand
for solar panels following a policy change by the Chinese
government to reduce the number of subsidized solar parks
to be installed. DSM Advanced Solar introduced a new
generation of solar backsheets which is being well received by
the market. DSM Bio-based Products & Services made good
progress in 2018, improving the robustness of the production
technology for second-generation bio-ethanol and introducing
a new generation of enzymes for first-generation bio-ethanol.
The Adjusted EBITDA was relatively stable compared with
2017. The Adjusted EBIT in 2017 included an impairment loss
on the related assets.Our innovation community also lays the groundwork for future
opportunities by identifying rising stars within the current
innovation pipeline and considering how longer-term,
purpose-led innovation projects could offer solutions for
Nutrition & Health, Climate & Energy, and Resources &
Circularity.
Creating opportunities for future earnings growth through
innovation
In 2018, innovation sales across DSM amounted to 19% from
sales from underlying sales, in line with our aspiration of around
20%. Furthermore, a strong and refocused innovation pipeline
was created to enhance long-term growth. Examples include:
- Project Clean Cow for feed additives that reduce methane
emissions from cattle

As the world increasingly seeks alternatives to fossil resources
and progresses toward a more sustainable, bio-renewable
economy, significant commercial opportunities are presenting
themselves in advanced biofuels and renewable chemical
building blocks such as bio-based succinic acid. With the
transition toward a low-carbon economy, the market for
biofuels will grow and we are offering a range of solutions.
DSM Bio-based Products & Services pioneers advances in
biomass conversion and seeks to demonstrate the
commercial viability of sustainable, renewable technologies in
collaboration with strategic partners in the value chain. In
particular, we have developed patented bioconversion
technologies (yeast and enzymes) for various feedstocks and
processes (including starch-based and cellulosic) in the
biofuels industry.
Our strategy is to deliver unique and differentiating
technologies that enable biofuel plant operators to optimize
their processes and maximize their yield and co-product
creation. This helps make the production of biofuels even more
sustainable.
Starch-based bio-ethanol
We successfully launched eBOOST™, a new proprietary yeast
for corn-ethanol production. Since its launch, eBOOST™ has
continued to demonstrate high performance at multiple plants.
Increased ethanol yields are consistently demonstrated at
industrial scale at customer plant locations.
Cellulosic bio-ethanol
The POET-DSM Advanced Biofuels joint venture operates a
commercial-scale production facility for cellulosic bio-ethanol
in Emmetsburg (Iowa, USA). The Emmetsburg plant
processes corn-crop residues by means of a bioconversion
process using enzymatic hydrolysis followed by fermentation.
The facility continues to ramp up volume.
Further enhancements in yield and robustness were made in
2018 by switching to a new yeast that we had developed
ourselves. POET-DSM also invested in an innovative on-site
enzyme manufacturing, which was mechanically completed
by the end of 2018. This has been fully integrated into the
process, forming a key component of the technology package
for further licensing.
Bio-succinic acid
The Reverdia joint venture between DSM and Roquette
operates a plant in Cassano (Italy) that produces high-quality
bio-succinic acid (Biosuccinium®). The joint venture's
customer portfolio grew by 48% in 2018. Industry segments

with Roquette, who will operate the plant.
DSM Advanced Solar
Solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity continues to grow more
rapidly than any other fossil or renewable power source. DSM
Advanced Solar aims to accelerate the uptake and
effectiveness of solar energy by focusing on the development
and commercialization of technologies and materials that
increase the efficiency of solar modules. Increased efficiency
reduces the cost of energy delivered.
More than 250 million PV modules installed to date are
equipped with DSM coating technologies. Our anti-reflective
coating has enabled the generation of more than 7,500 GWh
of additional power.
We introduced aftermarket coatings to select customers as an
extension of our market-leading Anti-Reflective coating and
Anti-Soiling coating. This new coating is designed for existing
solar modules that are as yet uncoated. It has been proven to
boost energy production by up to 3%.
The solar market increasingly recognizes our endurance
backsheet as reliable and durable, even in extreme conditions
such as desert or tropical settings and floating solar parks. We
are introducing cost-competitive backsheets that are 100%
recyclable and also have a lower footprint. For example, our
customer Sharp uses our endurance backsheet in their new
series of high-performance solar panels.
We announced a strategic alliance with Silfab Solar, North
America's leading solar module manufacturer, to mass-
produce high-power back-contact solar modules. This is a
major step toward introducing conductive backsheet-based
high-power modules to the US market in 2019.DSM Business Incubator
The DSM Business Incubator explores potential future
business opportunities in areas with a close link to our
technologies and competence base. Platforms are created
within the scope of securing society's food, health and energy
requirements, in close collaboration with industry partners and
existing and potential customers. The Business Incubator
feeds our new product pipeline with opportunities that address
previously unmet customer needs.
In 2018, the Business Incubator continued to work on three
key ventures. In the Canola venture, we produce a high-quality
plant protein from biomass derived from rapeseed, also known
as canola. This is for applications in the food & beverage
sector. The demonstration unit was used for further process
optimization and for producing pre-marketing volumes for
application development. Market interest in our CanolaPRO™
solution grew during 2018. In our energy storage project,
meanwhile, a number of potential leads were explored in 2018,
generating development projects at several battery/separator
companies. The third key venture is our partnership with
Syngenta, which continued the joint development of
microbials for crop protection agents (see next section,
'Innovation partnerships').
Innovation partnerships
We have many partnerships that support and accelerate
innovation. Highlights include our involvement in MIT.nano, a
ground-breaking academic nanotechnology laboratory at the
heart of the MIT campus. We are engaged with this state-of-
the-art facility through common research programs and
exchange of scientists. For more information, see 'Society' in
our 'Sustainability statements' on page 148. Another example
is our ongoing R&D partnership with Syngenta. We are
developing and commercializing a range of agricultural
solutions that are based on naturally occurring micro-
organisms rather than synthetic solutions.Review of business — Innovation Center

Making solar 
technology 
more viable
We believe that up to 50% of the world’s power could be 
delivered by solar in 2050. Today, there are still some 1.2 billion 
people in the world with little or no access to electricity. Emerging 
new solar materials will be a key factor in ensuring clean and 
aff  ordable energy for all.
With our solar material innovations, we are helping the industry to 
move closer to making solar energy accessible to everyone and 
helping it to boost power gain from photovoltaic (PV) modules 
and solar parks by lowering the Levelized Cost of Energy. 
Our fi  rst breakthrough was an anti-reﬂ  ective coating for solar glass, 
which squeezes out a 3% power gain compared to non-treated 
equivalents. This coating is now used in more than 250 million 
solar panels worldwide. This technology was adapted to include an 
anti-soiling feature specifi  cally for solar parks in dry, desert climates 
where sand and dirt are blown onto the solar panels. 
Now, our materials innovation strength is being used to create
100% recyclable, ﬂ  uorine-free backsheets for solar panels that
boost power gain even further and reduce carbon footprint
by 30% compared to conventional backsheets. India for example, 
has been investing heavily in PV technology but buying ﬂ  uorine-
based versions that cannot be recycled and will increase end-of-
life treatment costs and environmental impact. 
We engaged with Indian government agencies to articulate the 
many advantages of ﬂ  uorine-free modules over less sustainable 
alternatives, also demonstrating the recyclability of newer materials. As a consequence, these agencies sharpened their bid for 
renewable energy projects, removing the requirement for the use 
of ﬂ  uorine. Safer and more aff  ordable PV technology has thus 
become the new norm for India.
“The rapidly growing market for solar energy in India requires 
aff  ordable and sustainable solar technologies that also off  er 
enhanced product longevity and performance. DSM has the 
experience and capabilities to deliver these,” says Vinay Rustagi, 
Managing Director BRIDGE TO INDIA.
Purpose
The DSM Advanced Solar team has one clear goal: to make 
clean, solar energy a reality for all. 
Performance Driven
To date, our solar materials technology has enabled the 
generation of some 7,500 GWh of additional power, saving 
the equivalent of 3,700 kt of CO2eq. The drive to decarbonize 
the global power mix will at least double the installed solar 
PV capacity in the next fi  ve years. This will off  er attractive 
opportunities for innovations that lower the cost of solar power  
and improve the eﬃ   ciency and recyclability of solar panels.Review of business — Innovation Center

Sustainable 
crop protection
Societal demand for sustainable farming is growing. Growers 
are looking for reliable and easy-to-handle products that 
enable them to introduce biological solutions into their crop 
protection programs. Meanwhile, consumers are asking 
for biological rather than synthetic pest control strategies. 
Nature off  ers many as yet unexplored models of biologically-
based pest control. To harness this potential, we have 
entered into an R&D partnership with Syngenta to develop 
and commercialize sustainable microbial-based solutions for 
agriculture.
Together, we will accelerate the delivery of a broad spectrum 
of bio-control solutions. These solutions are based on 
naturally occurring micro-organisms that can protect crops 
from pests and diseases, manage resistance, and enhance 
plant productivity. We contribute our unique leading microbial 
database, strong screening competence and decades of 
experience in the scaling and manufacturing of microbial 
products. Syngenta has specialized know-how in agricultural 
applications and plant biotechnology alongside global 
market access and commercial strength.
Our cooperation with Syngenta is making excellent 
progress to accelerate the development of these solutions. 
Our innovative new screening, validation, discovery and 
development platform is up and running and has already 
tested around 150,000 samples based on our extensive 
proprietary micro-organism library, generating promising 
results. Camilla Corsi, Head of Crop Protection Research at 
Syngenta, says, “This is a unique partnership where the 
strengths of both companies are utilized to deliver new 
solutions for agriculture. Our teams have developed a 
trusted relationship that is key for success.”
Purpose
Society is asking for sustainable solutions to safeguard 
food and nutrition security. Together with Syngenta, we are 
accelerating the development of sustainable microbial-based 
solutions for crop protection.
Performance Driven
Currently valued at USD 2 billion annually, the global 
biocontrol market is growing at a compound annual growth 
rate of 10%. By 2030, the market for biological solutions 
could total more than USD 7 billion.Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  102 www.dsm.com
Breakthrough 
in eye treatment
Approximately 1.3 billion people around the world suff  er 
some form of vision impairment. About 80% is considered 
avoidable.
A key success factor in any eye therapy is the application 
of the right dosage of medicine in the right place over time. 
Diseases of the retina (back of the eye) require delivery of 
medicine via frequent localized needle injections that cause 
signifi  cant discomfort and inconvenience. 
We developed an innovative, sustained-release drug 
delivery solution to address this therapeutic need. Targeting 
retinal disorders such as age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME), it has shown 
strong eﬃ   cacy in preclinical models. A small, injectable, 
biodegradable polymer fi  ber is loaded with medicine and 
injected at a specifi  c location in the eye. The medicine is 
then released over several months until the fi  ber degrades. 
The new treatment is designed to reduce the need for 
injections in the eye from almost monthly to less than once 
every four months. Additional fi  bers can subsequently be 
injected to ensure continuous therapy. 
We have commercialized this solution through a strategic 
R&D collaboration and license agreement with Aerie 
Pharmaceuticals. The product is expected to enter human 
clinical evaluation in 2019. “This agreement opens up many new opportunities as we 
continue to innovate with new drugs and technologies to 
potentially treat many diseases of the eye,” says Dr. Vicente 
Anido, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Oﬃ   cer at Aerie. 
“This is a platform on which we can build our innovative 
sustained-release strategies for many ophthalmic diseases, 
including glaucoma.” 
Purpose
DME is the leading cause of blindness in the diabetic 
population, while AMD accounts for 8.7% of all blindness 
worldwide. With our alternative to traditional eye drug 
delivery systems, we are helping people to live healthier lives.  
Performance Driven
The current worldwide market for pharmacological treatment 
of eye diseases is estimated at USD 17 billion. It is projected 
to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5–6%, 
driven by underlying demographics and increased therapy 
penetration.Any consolidated activities that are outside the three reporting

DSM Insurances
We retain a limited part of our material damage and business
interruption and (product) liability risks via our captive
insurance company. In 2018, the total retained damages were
€ 10 million.
Corporate Research
The function of the Corporate Research Program (CRP) is to
develop key Science & Technology competences. Falling
under the responsibility of the Chief Technology Officer, the
CRP typically funds competence development programs with
a longer time horizon than those run by the business groups.
It also focuses on competences that have a broader relevance
for the company. The CRP additionally supports Science &
Technology programs that are carried out with external parties
and programs covering relevant new trends.
Share-based payments
Executives participate in the Long-Term Incentive (LTI)
scheme. This links their compensation to the long-term
interests of our company's stakeholders. It also provides a
vehicle for the attraction and retention of suitable employees.
As shares / share units have become more prevalent in the
market, we replaced stock options with shares / share units in
2017. This resulted in better alignment with the LTI vehicle
already in place for the Managing Board and the Executive
Committee. The use of shares / share units also targets yet
closer alignment with the interests of our stakeholders. As a
consequence of this switch, we have reduced our hedge
obligations. For detailed information, see Note 27 of the
'Consolidated financial statements' on page 212.Review of business — Corporate Activities
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  103 www.dsm.comPartnerships
As part of our strategic transformation and move away from
more commoditized and cyclical areas, we established the
joint ventures of DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals in 2011,
active in anti-infectives, and ChemicaInvest in 2015, active in
polymer intermediates and composite resins.
The results of these joint ventures are reported under 'Share
of profit of associates and joint ventures' and 'Other results
related to associates and joint ventures' in the 'Consolidated
Income statement' on page 165. See also page 188.
These joint ventures were created with the intention of
ultimately exiting these businesses over time and maximizing
value.
DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals
DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals (DSP) was formed in 2011
as a 50:50 joint venture between DSM and Sinochem Group.
DSP is the global leader in sustainable antibiotics, next-
generation statins and anti-fungals. On 31 October 2018, we
divested our stake in DSP to Bain Capital, a leading private
equity firm. We received € 247 million for our equity stake,
excluding an earn-out estimated at approximately €  36 million
and transaction related costs. This resulted in a book profit of
€ 109 million on the transaction. We received € 271 million in
cash following closing, including repayment of debt and after
transaction costs.ChemicaInvest
ChemicaInvest, formed in 2015, is a global leader in the
production and supply of caprolactam (Fibrant) and a leading
European supplier of acrylonitrile (AnQore) and composite
resins (Aliancys). At the joint venture's formation, we had a
35% shareholding in the company and CVC Capital Partners
owned 65%.
On 1 August 2018, Aliancys combined its operations with
AOC, a leading US-based producer and marketer of
composite resins, to form AOC Aliancys.
On 30 October 2018, Fibrant Holding B.V. completed the sale
of Fibrant B.V. and 60% of the shares of Fibrant China to the
Highsun Holdings Group Ltd. DSM anticipates receiving about
€ 200 million in cash related to this transaction, of which
€ 120 million was received in 2018.
As a result of the restructuring and divestment of the Fibrant
business by ChemicaInvest, we now have a 35% direct share
in the acrylonitrile business of AnQore and a 18.9% share in
the combined composite resins business of AOC Aliancys.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  104 www.dsm.comFinancial and reporting policies
As a basis for, and contribution to, effective risk management
and to ensure that the company is able to pursue its strategies,
even during periods of economic downturn, DSM aims to
retain a strong balance sheet and limit its financial risks.
DSM's Strategy 2021: Growth & Value - Purpose led,
Performance driven has ambitious strategic and financial
targets, which are outlined from page 22 onwards. Within the
context of this strategy, DSM aims to maintain a strong
investment grade long-term credit rating.
Most of DSM's external funding needs are financed through
long-term debt. Debt covenants are not included in the terms
and conditions of outstanding bonds and financing
arrangements. DSM aims to spread the maturity profile of
outstanding bonds in order to have adequate financial
flexibility.
An important element of the company's financial policy is the
allocation of cash flow. DSM primarily allocates cash flow to
investments aimed at strengthening its business positions and
securing stable, and preferably rising, dividend payments to
its shareholders. Remaining cash flow is used for acquisitions,
with a prudent and disciplined approach in targeting
investments predominantly in Nutrition. Share buy-backs are
considered in the absence of value-creating M&A
opportunities. 
DSM aims to provide a stable, and preferably rising, dividend.
DSM proposes to increase the dividend to ordinary
shareholders by about 25% for the year 2018. Dividends are
paid out in cash or in the form of ordinary shares at the option
of the shareholders, with a maximum of 40% of the total
dividend amount available for stock dividend.
In order to cover our commitments under the dividend policy
and under management and employee option and share
plans, DSM buys back shares insofar as this is necessary and
feasible. In the year 2018, 2,700,000 shares were
repurchased to meet these obligations.
It is company policy to hedge 100% of the currency risks
resulting from sales and purchases at the moment of
recognition of trade receivables and payables. Additionally,
under strict conditions, operating companies may opt to
hedge currency risks from firm commitments and forecast
transactions. The currencies giving rise to these risks are
primarily USD, CHF and JPY. The risks arising from currency
exposures are reviewed as and when appropriate.
A business or partner that is targeted for acquisition should
add value to DSM in terms of technological or market
competences. Acquired companies are in principle required
to contribute to DSM's cash earnings per share. In addition,they are required to meet the company's profitability,
sustainability and growth requirements. However, such
requirements may not be appropriate in the case of small,
innovative growth acquisitions.
DSM's policy in the various sub-disciplines of the finance
function is strongly oriented toward solidity, reliability and the
protection of cash flows. The finance function plays an
important role in business steering.

Reporting policy and justification of choices made
In this Report, DSM reports for the calendar year 2018. The
company reports on People, Planet and Profit information in
such a Report on an annual basis. The previous DSM
Integrated Annual Report was published on 1 March 2018.
In the Report by the Managing Board, we explain our vision
and policy with respect to sustainability practices and report
on our activities in this field during 2018. In addition to
disclosing data and developments in the categories of People,
Planet and Profit, we also report on the global societal
megatrends that drive our strategy, sustainability governance
framework, stakeholder engagement activities, and
management approach on material topics. DSM proactively
seeks out the views of key stakeholders on issues of material
importance to the company.
UN Global Compact
DSM has been a signatory to the UN Global Compact since
2007 and commits to annually report on progress in
implementing the UN Global Compact's 10 Principles in the
areas of human rights, child and forced labor, the environment
and anti-corruption. This Report is DSM's Communication on
Progress 2018, submitted to the UN Global Compact Office.
Our Code of Business Conduct, our Sustainability, Human
Resources, and Safety, Health and Environment (SHE)
policies, and our Supplier Sustainability Program are the
foundations on which DSM applies the standards of the Global
Compact.
We have also aligned our strategy with the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). DSM is familiar with the
opportunities and responsibilities that the SDGs represent for
DSM's business. Based on our mapping, we believe that we
contribute to all of them, and have chosen to focus on the
goals which most closely align with our strategic ambitions. In
this Report, we continue to include the SDGs into our reporting
process, for example by mapping SDG reporting priorities in
our value creation model, our material topics, and the solutions
that we highlight.
Global Reporting Initiative
At DSM, we base our sustainability reporting on international
non-financial reporting guidelines. We frequently assess to
what extent sustainability aspects become material to our
company and our stakeholders. In case specific indicators
become relevant to the company's sustainability performance,
appropriate actions are taken that allow the necessary data to
be collected so as to be able to disclose progress in the future.
This Report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI
Standards: Comprehensive option. A detailed overview of how
DSM reports according to the GRI Standards comprehensive
indicators, including a reference to relevant sections in thisReport, is provided on the company's Integrated Annual
Report website.
Integrated Reporting Framework
We align with the recommendations of the International
Integrated Reporting Council <IR> Framework where
possible. The intention of the <IR> Framework is to provide
additional guiding principles and content elements for an
integrated report. Aligning with the framework allows us to
better identify and communicate how the company creates
value for stakeholders in People, Planet and Profit, as well as
the interconnection between these three dimensions.
The Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
The recommendations from the Taskforce on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) are a set of voluntary, climate-
related financial disclosures for use by companies to provide
information to their stakeholders. DSM was among the first
companies in 2017 to commit to implementing, as fully as
practicable, these recommendations over the following three
years as outlined in the TCFD's implementation path. This
Report contains our first TCFD relevant disclosures on
Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and
Targets. For more information on how we report against the
TCFD recommendations, see the 'Sustainability statements'.
Selection of topics
The topics covered in this Report were selected on the basis
of input from internal and external stakeholders and the related
materiality analysis, which assessed the relevance and impact
of selected topics for DSM and various stakeholders. On the
basis of the principle of materiality (using the GRI Standards),
DSM distinguishes between topics whose importance
warrants publication in this Report (relevant to both DSM and
stakeholders), and topics whose importance warrants
publication on the company website only (topics important to
either DSM or stakeholders). DSM reports on 'External
recognitions' on page 40 in 'Stakeholders'. Other examples of
external recognition can be found on the company website.
Scope
The People and Brighter Living Solutions data in this Report
cover all entities that belong to the scope of the Consolidated
financial statements, provided that DSM also has operational
control. As such, three small units have been excluded from
the scope. Planet reporting covers manufacturing units where
commercial production by DSM occurs.
Acquisitions and divestments
The People data for newly acquired companies are reported
from the first full month after the acquisition date. The Safety,
Health (People), Environment (Planet) and Brighter Living
Solutions data for newly acquired companies are reported at
the latest in the year following the first full year after acquisition,
because these companies' reporting procedures first have to
be aligned with those of DSM. In the case of divestments,
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  106 www.dsm.comsafety data are consolidated until the moment of divestment,
People data to the end of the month of divestment, and Planet
data are reported to the last full year at DSM.
Planet methodology
Our progress on the key environmental performance
indicators is re-evaluated annually. Data on these indicators
are collected twice a year for all DSM sites. The data are based
on these sites' own measurements and calculations, which in
turn are founded on definitions, methods and procedures
established at corporate level. The site managers of reporting
units are responsible for the quality of the data. Data are
collected using measurements and calculations in the
production processes, information from external parties (e.g.
on waste and external energy) and estimates based on expert
knowledge.
Reporting units have direct insight into their performance
compared to previous years and are required to provide
justifications for any deviations above the threshold. For most
parameters, the threshold is set at 10%. The year-on-year
comparability of the data can be affected by changes in our
portfolio as well as by improvements to measurement and
recording systems at the various sites. Whenever impact is
relevant, this is stated in the Report. Details for the regions, as
well as the methodology and calculations, are published on
the company website, together with an explanation of the
definitions used.
People methodology
People data are collected per business group and
consolidated at corporate level.
Brighter Living Solutions
For a definition of Brighter Living Solutions, see Planet section
in 'Explanation of some concepts and ratios' on page 242.
DSM reports twice a year the percentage of Brighter Living
Solutions within the running business portfolio.
The sustainability assessments to support the qualification for
Brighter Living Solutions are required to be made by internal
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) experts and reviewed using the
four-eyes principle with at least one internal, independent
senior LCA consultant. The financial data are validated with
the Corporate Sustainability department and consolidated as

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  107 www.dsm.comIntroduction
Koninklijke DSM N.V. (Royal DSM) is a company limited by
shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam. It is managed by a
Managing Board together with an Executive Committee and
an independent Supervisory Board. Members of the Managing
Board and the Supervisory Board are appointed (and, if
necessary, dismissed) by the General Meeting of
Shareholders.
The company is governed by Dutch law and by its Articles of
Association, which can be consulted on the company
website . The General Meeting of Shareholders decides on any
amendment to the Articles of Association by an absolute
majority of the votes cast. A decision to amend the Articles of
Association may only be taken at the proposal of the Managing
Board, subject to approval of the Supervisory Board.
At DSM, we fully inform our stakeholders about our corporate
objectives, the way our company is managed, and our
company's performance. In doing so, we aim to pursue an
open dialogue with our shareholders and other stakeholders.
Our company has an organizational structure built around
business groups that are empowered to perform all short-term
and long-term business functions. In this they are assisted by
support and corporate functions, as well as by regional
organizations.
Managing Board and Executive Committee
The Executive Committee was installed to enable faster
strategic alignment and operational execution by increasing
our focus on the development of our business, innovation and
people.
The Executive Committee comprises the Managing Board
members as well as four senior managers with responsibility
respectively for DSM Nutritional Products (Chris
Goppelsroeder), DSM Food Specialties and Corporate
Strategy & Acquisitions (Philip Eykerman), the DSM Innovation
Center (Rob van Leen), and Group People & Organization
(Judith Wiese). The latter four managers are appointed by the
Chairman of the Managing Board after consultation with the
Supervisory Board. The Executive Committee focuses on
topics such as our company's overall strategy and direction,
review of business results, functional and regional strategies,
budget-setting, and people and organization. The statutory
responsibilities of the Managing Board remain unchanged.
The Managing Board is ultimately responsible for our
company's strategy, its portfolio management, the
deployment of human capital and financial capital resources,the company's risk management system, its financial
performance, and its performance in the area of sustainability.
The Managing Board is thus also accountable to the
Supervisory Board for our company's strategy and
management. The full Managing Board attends the
Supervisory Board meetings. Other Executive Committee
members attend those Supervisory Board meetings, or parts
of them, that are specifically relevant to their area of
responsibility.
The Managing Board consists of two or more members, to be
determined by the Supervisory Board. The current
composition of the Managing Board can be found in the
chapter 'Supervisory Board and Managing Board Royal DSM'
on page 137. Since the introduction of the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code in 2004, members of the Managing Board
have been appointed for a period of four years.
The members of the Managing Board are collectively
responsible for the management of DSM. In addition to this
collective responsibility, Managing Board members have
individual responsibility for certain tasks, business clusters,
functional areas, and regions. The distribution of these tasks
is published on the company website.
The remuneration of Managing Board members is determined
by the Supervisory Board based on the remuneration policy
approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders. The
remuneration policy for the Managing Board can be found in
the 'Report by the Supervisory Board' under 'Remuneration
policy Managing Board' on page 131.
The functioning of and decision-making within the Managing
Board and the Executive Committee are governed by the
Regulations of the Managing Board, which are in accordance
with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and can be found
on the company website.
In 2018, the Managing Board and Executive Committee had
39 formal meetings, some of these by teleconference. No
Managing Board member had to be excused from meetings
during the year. In five Executive Committee meetings, a
member was excused on account of other commitments. In
all cases, members who were unable to attend gave advance
input for the meeting either in writing or via other members.
The Executive Committee and Managing Board take the time
for an evaluation at the end of every meeting they have. This
evaluation can be about topics that have been discussed that
meeting, but also reflecting on meeting dynamics and
individual or collective performance. Furthermore, there are
several informal moments, such as a collective dinner at the
end of a full-day meeting, built into the meeting schedule.Corporate governance and risk
management
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  108 www.dsm.comOnce a year, the Executive Committee and Managing Board
take the time to get together and discuss their performance
as a team.
Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board comprises at least five members. Its
current composition can be found in the chapter 'Supervisory
Board and Managing Board Royal DSM' on page 136.
Supervisory Board members are appointed for a period of four
years, after which they may be reappointed for a further four
years. A Supervisory Board member may subsequently be
reappointed for a period of two years, and this appointment
may be extended by at most two years. For reappointment
after an eight-year period, reasons must be provided in the
report of the Supervisory Board.
All current members of the Supervisory Board are independent
in accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.
The remuneration of Supervisory Board members is
determined by the General Meeting of Shareholders. The
functioning of and decision making within the Supervisory
Board are governed by the Regulations of the Supervisory
Board, which are in accordance with the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code and can be found on the company
website.
The Supervisory Board supervises the policy pursued by the
Managing Board, the Managing Board's performance of its
managerial duties, and the company's general course of
affairs, taking the interests of all the company's stakeholders
into account. When the Executive Committee was
established, the Supervisory Board also took on responsibility
for ensuring that the checks and balances that are part of the
two-tier system are still taken into account, paying specific
attention to the dynamics between Managing Board and
Executive Committee. The Supervisory Board is enabled to do
so through the information provided to it by the Managing
Board.
The annual financial statements are approved by the
Supervisory Board and then submitted to the Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) for adoption, accompanied by
an explanation by the Supervisory Board of how it carried out
its supervisory duties during the year under review.
In line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the
Supervisory Board has established from among its members
an Audit Committee, a Nomination Committee and a
Remuneration Committee, besides which there is also a
Sustainability Committee.
The task of these committees is to prepare the decision-
making of the Supervisory Board. These committees are
governed by charters drawn up in line with the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code. They can be found on the
company website.Diversity
At DSM, we strongly value diversity, and we endeavor to reflect
this in our Board memberships. The Supervisory Board has
drafted diversity policies for the Supervisory Board, the
Managing Board and the Executive Committee. These policies
seek a balanced composition of the respective body, taking
into account gender, age, knowledge, experience, and
nationality / cultural background. In addition, for the
composition of the Supervisory Board, the board tenure is
taken into account.
In terms of gender diversity, we aim for at least 30% of the
positions in our Supervisory Board, Managing Board and
Executive Committee to be held by women and at least 30%
by men — percentages which reflect Dutch legislation. To
ensure a balanced composition in terms of nationality/cultural
background, our aim is not to have more than 50% of the
members of our Supervisory Board or Executive Committee
drawn from a single nationality. While a diverse composition in
terms of nationality/cultural background is also taken into
account in the composition of the Managing Board, no
quantitative target is set here, given the relatively small number
of Managing Board members.
Our diversity policies are implemented by applying them to
nominations for (re)appointments of Supervisory Board and
Managing Board members as well as to appointments of
Executive Committee members. At the 2018 Annual General
Meeting, Rob Routs was reappointed based on his extensive
experience and knowledge and his qualities as Chair of our
Supervisory Board, as demonstrated during his eight-year
tenure to date. The at the time on-going regular strategic
review and the fact that the Deputy Chair was stepping down
at the 2018 AGM were additional reasons to safeguard
continuity in the Supervisory Board.
Geraldine Matchett was reappointed as a member of the
Managing Board following her significant contribution to the
execution of our company strategy and the improvements —
including financial improvements — made during her first
tenure as member of the Managing Board. This reappointment
also reflects the leadership qualities she has shown through
her contributions to the Managing Board and the Executive
Committee. With her reappointment, the diversity in terms of
gender, nationality, experience and knowledge within the
Managing Board and Executive Committee was continued.
Both our Supervisory Board and our Managing Board were
well balanced in 2018 in terms of gender, comprising 43% and
33% women respectively, which is in line with Dutch legislation
and with the company's own diversity policy. The gender
diversity level of 29% women within our Executive Committee
comes very close to our target for at least 30% of these

General Meeting of Shareholders
The main powers of the General Meeting of Shareholders
relate to:
-The appointment, suspension and dismissal of members of
the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board
-Approval of the remuneration policy of the Managing Board
- Approval of the remuneration of the Supervisory Board
- The adoption of the annual financial statements and

The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is held within six months
of the end of the financial year in order to discuss and, if
applicable, adopt the Annual Report, the annual accounts, any
appointments of members of the Managing Board and the
Supervisory Board, and any of the other topics mentioned
above.The AGM and, if necessary, other General Meetings of
Shareholders are called by the Managing Board or the
Supervisory Board. The agenda and explanatory notes are
published on the company website.
According to the Articles of Association, shareholders who,
individually or jointly, represent at least 1% of the issued capital
have the right to request the Managing Board or the
Supervisory Board to put items on the agenda. Such requests
need to be received in writing by the Chairman of the
Managing Board or the Chair of the Supervisory Board at least
60 days before the date of the General Meeting of
Shareholders.
The AGM was held on 9 May 2018. The agenda was
essentially similar to that of previous years. Additional topics
were the implementation of the new Dutch Corporate
Governance Code, the reappointment of Rob Routs as a
member of the Supervisory Board and the reappointment of
Geraldine Matchett as a member of the Managing Board.
The Articles of Association were amended to reflect changes
in law and regulations including the implementation of the new
Dutch Corporate Governance Code published on 8 December
2016 and applicable as of the financial year 2017. Further
details can be found on the company website.

Control Effectiveness and Continuity AssumptionCOSO-ERM elementsManaging Board’s 
‘in control’ statement
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  110 www.dsm.comAt DSM, we visualize our control environment as a 'house' that
includes the internal control process areas with control
measures related to strategic, operational, compliance and
reporting risks. The elements of COSO (the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission)
provide a framework for identifying company activities that are
carried out to ensure that the control environment is
adequately structured. Finally, to make sure that a learning
curve is achieved, monitoring activities include the sharing of
findings and experiences as well as the application of control
measures across the supporting pillars.
DSM's structure for managing risks involves three lines of
defense (see also 'Risk management' on page 118). Line
management within the units is responsible for the first line of
defense. Risk management forms the second line of defense,
assessing the effectiveness of risk management and internal
control at both unit and corporate level. Corporate Operational
Audit (COA) is the third line of defense. The scope and
frequency of COA audits is determined by ranking the
auditable units according to the scale of their risk exposure,
using a set of defined characteristics.
COA assesses the operation of risk management activities by
the units, as well as the design of the risk management and
internal control systems, by performing risk-based audits.
These examine the key processes and activities for the specific
units. By means of these audits, COA closes the risk
management cycle and provides additional assurance to the
Managing Board as to the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the risk management and internal control
systems.
COA reports its audit results to the Managing Board twice a
year. COA also shares an overview with the Audit Committee
of the Supervisory Board and communicates the executive
summary of each audit report to the CFO and CEO.
In 2018, COA carried out 47 audits. In general, audit findings
are considered opportunities for improvement as part of a
healthy learning culture. In approximately 11% of the audited
areas (e.g. operations, finance, SHE, commercial) significant
management attention was required to achieve the DSM
standard. In the rare event of insufficient follow-up on a finding,
the Director of COA escalates that finding to the CEO.
Dutch Corporate Governance Code
DSM supports the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, which
was most recently amended in 2016 and has been in force
since the financial year 2017. The Dutch Corporate
Governance Code can be found on www.mccg.nl.
We ensure our continued compliance with the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code. The proposal to amend the
Articles of Association — to reflect changes in law andregulations, including the implementation of the new Dutch
Corporate Governance Code — was approved by the Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders on 9 May 2018.
Long-term value creation is embedded in both our company
Strategy 2021: Growth & Value - Purpose led, Performance
driven  and our company culture: Our purpose is to create
brighter lives for all. Sustainability is central to how we fulfill that
mission, and to achieve this, we consider People, Planet and
Profit in all we do. We apply our company strategy to drive our
business and innovation strategies, which address the
challenges of Nutrition & Health, Climate & Energy, and
Resources & Circularity. More information on how long-term
value creation is fundamental to our strategy and culture can
be found in the Strategy and People sections of this Report,
as well as on page 32 (which describes 'How we create value
for our stakeholders') and on page 10  (which describes 'DSM
and the Sustainable Development Goals').
Regarding the appointment of members of the Managing
Board for a period of at most four years (Principle 2.2 of the
Dutch Corporate Governance Code), it should be noted that
we have adhered to this principle since the introduction of the
Dutch Corporate Governance Code in 2004. Since we respect
agreements made before the introduction of the said code, the
current Chairman of the Managing Board will remain
appointed for an indefinite period.
Any proposed substantial change to our corporate
governance structure and compliance with the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code should be submitted to the
General Meeting of Shareholders for discussion under a
separate agenda item.
All documents related to the implementation of the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code at DSM can be found in the
'Corporate Governance' section of the company website.
Governance framework
Organizational & operating model
Our business groups are the main building-blocks of the
company's organization. They have integral long-term and
short-term responsibility for business and have at their
disposal all functions that are crucial to their business success.
As the company's primary organizational and entrepreneurial
building-blocks, our business groups focus on four primary
business functions: Innovation and R&D, Direct Sourcing,
Manufacturing & Operations, and Marketing & Sales. Intra-
company product supplies are contracted by the business
groups on an arm's-length basis.
The business groups are organized into clusters, thus ensuring
coherence of operations and the leveraging of resources
within each cluster. The clusters are the main organizational
entities for external strategic and financial reporting. ThisCorporate governance and risk management — Dutch Corporate Governance Code
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  111 www.dsm.comstructure ensures flexibility, efficiency and speed of response
to market changes. In order to ensure sufficient independence
regarding financial management, the CFO has no business
groups reporting to her.
Our business groups receive services from global support
functions and functional excellence departments and are
supported by the regional organizations. This set-up enables
us to create a global, high-performing organization focused on
meeting its targets and achieving its ambitions. The support
functions and functional excellence departments are paid for
their services by the users — the business groups and, to a
lesser extent, other DSM units. Corporate departments are
paid from a corporate budget.
Support functions provide those services that can be delivered
more efficiently (in terms of total cost of ownership) by
leveraging them across the company, thus capturing scale
benefits and delivering higher quality at lower cost, rather than
having them arranged in each business group separately.
Within support functions, centers of expertise provide
specialist support, while shared service centers provide
standard transactional support. Business partnering is the
concept that acts as the interface between the business
groups and the support functions. Business partners
consequently have a second reporting line in the business. In
order to ensure that the functional policies sufficiently reflect
regional requirements, the support functions work closely with
the regional organizations and integrate their advice.
Each support function reports to a Managing Board member.
There are support functions in the areas of Finance, People &
Organization, Legal, Indirect Sourcing, Communications and
ICT.
Corporate functions (small, high-level groups) supporting the
Managing Board and Executive Committee are also seen as
support functions. The corporate departments are: Corporate
Strategy & Acquisitions, Corporate Operational Audit, Group
Risk Management, Corporate Sustainability, Corporate
Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs.
Functional excellence departments are mandated by the
Managing Board to help the businesses achieve excellence in
their respective fields. They cover the areas of Operations &
Responsible Care, Marketing & Sales and Science &
Technology. Functional excellence departments support our
businesses in improving their performance. They also provide
guidance in setting aspiration levels and targets.
Governance framework
The following figure depicts our company's overall governance
framework and the most important governance elements and
regulations at each level.

Management Framework for 
operational unitsOperational
unitsManaging
Board / 
Corporate  ShareholdersFor the sake of clarity, a short summary of the main aspects
of the framework at Managing Board/corporate level and
operational level is given here. The Managing Board and
Executive Committee adhere to the Regulations of the
Managing Board. The Managing Board and Executive
Committee work according to the Management Framework
for the corporate level. This implies, among other things, that
they adhere to the DSM Code of Business Conduct and
applicable corporate policies and requirements. The
Management Framework for the corporate level further
provides a description of the most important (decision-
making) processes, responsibilities and 'rules of the game' at
Managing Board, Executive Committee, functional and
regional levels, and includes governance relations with the
immediately superior levels (Supervisory Board and
shareholders) and the operational units.
The company's strategic direction and objectives are set by
means of a Corporate Strategy Dialogue. In June 2018, DSM
presented its updated Strategy 2021: Growth & Value -
Purpose led, Performance driven, which is described in more
detail, see page 22.
The operational units conduct their business within the
parameters of the Management Framework for operational
units. This implies, among other things, that they:
- Comply with the DSM Code of Business Conduct,
Corporate Requirements and Directives
-Establish the strategy, objectives and operational targets of
their business according to the Business Strategy Dialogue,
in alignment with the Corporate Strategy Dialogue, in which
various scenarios and related risk profiles are investigated,
and report on the achievement of these
-Implement risk management actions according to an Annual
Risk Management Plan and in line with corporate policies
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  112 www.dsm.com- Execute company-wide standards for support functions
(systems, processes, vendors, etc.)
- Implement annual functional improvement plans, monitor
the effectiveness of the risk management and internal
control system by means of process risk assessments and
internal audits, and regularly discuss the findings with the
Executive Committee member responsible
Independent audits for all operational units are conducted by
the Corporate Operational Audit (COA) department. The
Director of COA reports to the CFO and has access to the
Chairman of the Managing Board, the external auditor and the
Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the
Director of COA acts as the compliance officer regarding
inside information and is also the secretary of the Disclosure
Committee, as well as being chair of the DSM Alert
Committee, which is responsible for our whistleblower policy,
systems and processes.
Chaired by the CFO, the Disclosure Committee ensures the
timely and accurate disclosure of share-price-sensitive
information related to the company and is responsible for the
implementation of company rules on the holding and
execution of transactions in the company's financial
instruments, among other things.
A third committee at corporate level is the Fraud Committee,
which was installed to ensure structural follow-up of fraud
cases with the aim of reducing fraud exposure. Relevant
corporate functions participate in the Fraud Committee, which
is chaired by the CFO.
Sustainability Governance Framework
Managing Board
Sustainability falls under the responsibility of the Managing
Board. While CEO/Chairman of the Managing Board Feike
Sijbesma is the primary point of contact, other members also
chair sustainability topics and initiatives.
Feike Sijbesma oversaw sustainability as a key responsibility
and company value as well as a driver of business growth. He
also oversaw our engagement with organizations including the
United Nations and the World Bank, our strategic partnership
with the World Economic Forum and our nutrition-related
initiatives including the WFP partnership.Geraldine Matchett integrated sustainability into financial
decision making and represented DSM in the Accounting for
Sustainability (A4S) CFO Leadership Network. She also
oversaw our efforts and commitment toward the Taskforce for
Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations, and
chaired the Inclusion & Diversity Council.
Dimitri de Vreeze was responsible for Safety, Health and
Environment (SHE) and also oversaw our Supplier
Sustainability Program and the sourcing of electricity from
renewable sources in his responsibility for the Sourcing
function.
Supervisory Board
Our Supervisory Board has its own Sustainability Committee
to oversee progress against targets and to report on the
embedding of sustainability across the organization. For more
details, see 'Supervisory Board Report' on page 125.
External Sustainability Advisory Board
Comprising a diverse international group of thought leaders,
DSM's Sustainability Advisory Board acts as a sparring partner
for the Managing Board and senior executives, to help sharpen
their focus on strategic issues, deepen their understanding of
external stakeholder needs, conduct advocacy and handle
dilemmas. This board met twice in 2018 together with the
Managing Board and a number of senior executives. Subjects
included DSM's corporate strategy update and purpose,
innovation project and business updates, science-based
targets, digitization and the future of transport. They also took
the opportunity to visit DSM-Niaga, DSM Dyneema and DSM
Advanced Solar locations. In Amsterdam, they hosted
employees in a townhall session to exchange thoughts on
DSM and sustainability. Jessica Fanzo stepped down from the
board due to the requirements of her new position at the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Ertharin
Cousin, the former Executive Director of the United Nations
World Food Programme, joined the board, and in doing so,
maintained the desired balance of knowledge across our three
focus domains. This board also benefits greatly from its gender
and nationality diversity.Corporate governance and risk management — Governance framework

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  114 www.dsm.comDSM Code of Business Conduct
Introduction
The DSM Code of Business Conduct ('the Code') serves as
an umbrella for several other DSM regulations and forms the
basis for our company's ethical business behavior. Our
corporate strategy builds on this foundation. All DSM
employees are expected to follow the Code, which is availablein seven languages. The full text also appears on the company
website . The Managing Board holds DSM's unit management
accountable for compliance.

Rules
The DSM values training program contains several e-learning
courses on these regulations for all employees or, for certain
subject matter, specific target groups. When DSM acquires a
business, integration and compliance plans are rolled out to
make sure new employees are trained.
DSM's regulations cover the three dimensions of People,
Planet and Profit, of which the most important are listed here:
People:  To support DSM's ambition to create an incident-free
and injury-free workplace, the Life Saving Rules specify the 12
most important rules that must be followed by all employees
to prevent incidents. In the revision of the Life Saving Rules,
improved standards of warehouse safety have been included.
The corresponding e-learning course will be updated in 2019.
The Unlawful Harassment Prevention e-learning emphasizes
the importance of the cultural, diversity and non-discrimination
aspects of the Code and focuses on effective employee
relations, communications, and non-discriminatory practices.
The DSM Privacy Code for Employee Data and the DSM
Privacy Code for Customer, Supplier and Business Partner
Data prescribe mandatory training for Privacy Officers, HR
employees, legal counsels and employees who regularly work
with personal data. In 2018, additional concise e-learnings
were introduced to train our employees on the consequences
of the new European General Data Protection Regulation,
such as the timely reporting of privacy breaches.A Human Rights position paper is available on the company
website. For more information, see 'Human rights' on page
51.
Planet:  The Basic Course Responsible Care addresses the
elements of the Responsible Care Program: Safety, Health,
and Environment; Product Stewardship; Security and
Sustainability.
Profit:  DSM has e-learnings for Global Competition Law
Principles and Practices and for Global Trade Controls.
Compliance is embedded in our systems and processes.
Company master data is screened to check customers and
suppliers against embargoes and lists of sanctioned parties.
The DSM Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) Policy and
Compliance Manual is shared with selected employees in
commercial and business roles. Where appropriate, this is
provided in local languages to facilitate better understanding.
For example, the DSM ABC Policy and Compliance Manual,
an easy-to-use ABC checklist, and ABC classroom training
(integrated into the Competition Law classroom program) are
available in Chinese. The ABC due diligence program for DSM
agents and distributors was further implemented during 2018.
The Security e-learning covers our seven Key Security
Behaviors. To complete this e-learning, employees are
required to read and sign off on the DSM Code of Conduct for
Information Security. In the fourth quarter of 2018, a Cyber
Fraud Awareness e-learning was introduced as an additionalCorporate governance and risk management — DSM Code of Business Conduct
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  115 www.dsm.comtraining to increase awareness among all employees regarding
prevalent types of cybercrime.
We also have rules in place on the holding and execution of
transactions in DSM financial instruments and certain other
financial instruments related to trading in DSM shares, and
where applicable, shares and related financial instruments in
other companies. These apply to all relevant employees,
including the Executive Committee, the Managing Board, and
the Supervisory Board.
Value chain
The business principles most relevant to our supply chain are
brought together in the Supplier Code of Conduct and are also
structured along the three dimensions of People, Planet and
Profit. The Supplier Code of Conduct, available in eight
languages on the company website , is signed off by suppliers
in framework contracts, confirming their commitment to
sustainability, among other things.
For distributor and agent contracts, the ABC Policy is
translated into terms and conditions that ensure ethical
business conduct when these parties act on behalf of DSM or
deal with DSM products further down the value chain.
Training and awareness
Employees must regularly refresh their DSM values training.
The implementation of this training program continues to
progress well. In 2018, our learning management system was
supplemented with an external portal to enable relevant
contractors and other third parties to follow courses of the
DSM values training program. At year-end, most employees
had completed or refreshed their training (excluding
employees of some recently acquired businesses).
A Review Team, chaired by the Vice President Group Risk
Management, monitors implementation of the DSM values
training program. This team also monitors internal and external
developments around corporate ethics in order to promote
and safeguard the company's values and reputation.
Employees for whom competition laws are most relevant must
confirm their compliance with the rules set out in the DSM
Competition Law Compliance Manual. In this statement, they
confirm that they are not aware of any violation of competition
laws by DSM. Sign-off levels are excellent. Alleged breaches
are reported to, and discussed with, Group Legal Affairs. In
2018, no breaches were reported.
Letter of Representation
At the end of each year, management of all 34 operational
units signs off on a Letter of Representation. With this, they
confirm the compliance of the unit and its employees withapplicable laws and regulations, the Code and related values
training, and DSM's corporate policies and requirements (see
'Risk management' on page 118).
Consequence management
We apply zero-tolerance consequence management to
violations of the Code. Under our whistleblower procedure
(DSM Alert), most violations are reported to and dealt with by
local line management. Where this is not considered
appropriate, complaints are made directly to the DSM Alert
Officer. In all cases, consequence management practices (e.g.
official warning, temporary suspension, dismissal) are in place
to support compliance with the Code. The DSM Alert Officer
reports to the Managing Board and also reports independently
to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board twice a year.
Any individual not employed by DSM who might wish to voice
a concern regarding violations of the Code may also contact
the DSM Alert Officer via the company website.
In 2018, 28 Alert cases (reports of potential violations of the
Code) were received by the DSM Alert Officer, two of which
were reported by an external party. This is at the same level
as in previous years. There were three potential bribery and
corruption cases reported. After investigation, none of these
three cases could be substantiated.
The table on the following page gives an overview of all
reported violations of the Code, with a breakdown by Triple P
dimension and region. Proven serious violations may result in
dismissal or other forms of consequence management. In line
with this policy, 42 employees were dismissed in 2018
because of breaches of the Code or other legal or local
company regulations. In addition, 112 employees received
another form of consequence management (official warning or
suspension). Over the years, the number of dismissal cases
has remained about the same, whereas there is an increase
of other kinds of consequence management cases being
reported.
People : Most of the cases in the People dimension relate to
violations of the Life Saving Rules. Inappropriate behavior that
does not contribute to a safe and healthy working environment
(discrimination, sexual and other kinds of harassment) is also
reported in this dimension. Health and safety in the workplace
are a priority for the company and incident-reporting channels
are well known.
Planet : There was one violation of the Code reported in the
Planet dimension in 2018 due to irresponsible behavior on the
part of an employee. This violation led to a minor environmental
incident.
Profit : Most of the cases reported in the Profit dimension relate
to the incorrect registration of working hours, conflicts of
interest and fraudulent expense claims.

The Managing Board is accountable for the management of all risks associated with our company's strategy and activities. To this
end, appropriate risk management and internal control systems are in place. The responsibility for identifying and managing risks
lies with DSM's individual units.
The units are supported by the Group Risk Management (GRM) department and are regularly assessed by the Corporate
Operational Audit (COA) department. Both GRM and COA report directly to the CFO, and COA has direct access to the CEO as
well as to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.

'DSM Risk Management Cycle').
A full description of our risk management and internal control
system and process, together with a description of the
identified risks, is available on the company website.
It is the responsibility of the business groups, support
functions, functional excellence departments and regions (the
units) within DSM to set up, maintain, operate and monitor an
appropriate risk management and internal control system
within their area of responsibility. This responsibility includes
the management, monitoring, reporting and controlling of
risks. The units are supported in this by risk managers. COA

Mission / Internal environment
Values and business principles are key elements of the internal
environment for risk management and form the starting point
of the risk management cycle. DSM's values are directly
related to our purpose of creating brighter lives for all. All our
employees receive regular training on values and business
principles in line with the framework requirements. They first
receive overarching training on the DSM Code of Business
Conduct.
In 2018, we implemented a new global risk management
operating model to improve the agility, effectiveness and
efficiency of our risk management activities. Risk managers
have dual reporting lines: 
(1) A functional reporting line into Group Risk Management to
guarantee the quality of risk management and continuous
improvement
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  118 www.dsm.com(2) A business / support function reporting line to safeguard
close connection to business / support function goals and
operations
We have made it easier for employees to follow our Corporate
Requirements by clearly communicating who exactly needs to
understand and adhere to specific requirements.
Strategy / Objective setting
Our Group Risk Management supports the Executive
Committee, business groups, and support functions at theglobal and regional levels with risk assessments, Letter of
Representation, Corporate Requirements, Code of Business
Conduct, and internal control. It also runs a DSM values and
risk management training program to deliver on our company
strategy.
Risk assessment and response
An important precursor to any risk assessment is our overall
risk appetite, which is defined and updated annually by the
Executive Committee. In 2018, our overall risk appetite
remained the same as in the previous year (see figure below).
DSM’s risk appetite
Generic/strategic
(e.g.: Innovation, People/organization/culture, 
Intellectual property, Raw materials/energy, Price/availability, 
Acquisitions and partnerships, Divestments, Brand)
Operational
(e.g.: Reputation, Customer, Project management, Production 
process, (Information-) Security, Business continuity, 
Product liability, Safety, Health and Environment)
Financial and reporting
(e.g.: Liquidity and market, Reporting integrity, Pensions, 
Financial risks (e.g. credit, tax))
Legal and compliance
(e.g.: Legal non-compliance, Non-compliance with DSM 
Requirements)Averse Minimalist Cautious Open Hungry
Risk assessments and mitigation plans are carried out at
various levels in the organization. We take a standard but
flexible, seven-step approach to risk assessments:
- Risk assessment planning
- Preparation
- Risk identification and clustering
- Risk rating
- Evaluation and risk response
- Reporting
- Periodic monitoring and reviewing
Risk assessments focus on various categories including
material, non-material and reputational risks and emerging
risks. In 2018, we identified additional opportunities for
improving how we facilitate, challenge, define and monitor our
mitigation efforts. As a result, we created a Risk Assessment
Manual and also updated the risk assessment training
program regarding facilitation and execution.
Corporate Risk Assessment
We periodically conduct a Corporate Risk Assessment (CRA),
which is the responsibility of the Managing Board. As part of
this assessment, the Executive Committee reviews and agrees
on the top risks facing DSM as well as emerging risks, whichcould become material after the current strategic period. The
Executive Committee also agrees on how to mitigate and
monitor these. The outcome of the CRA is reported to, and
discussed with, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board
annually (see table of Top risks on page 121).
Business Risk Assessments
Our business groups also conduct assessments. Business
Risk Assessments (BRAs) and their equivalents for our
business units, functions and regions are carried out by cross-
functional teams. These include experienced facilitators as
well as experts who can challenge assumptions in order to
help improve the quality of these risk assessments.
Process Risk Assessments
We additionally conduct Process Risk Assessments (PRAs)
which are intended to make our processes as robust,
business-specific and fraud-proof as possible.
Project Risk Assessments
At project level, risk assessments are performed on an
ongoing basis to secure successful delivery of project
objectives and value creation for the company.Corporate governance and risk management — Risk management
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  119 www.dsm.comMonitoring activities
We have various means of monitoring and related reporting.
These include monitoring of events, Letter of Representation
(LoR), external/internal audits, compliance checks, and
functioning of the common controls. Monitoring and reporting
are discussed in risk management committees in order to
evaluate and manage the status of the risk profile.
The most important types of risks for our units, as well as any
incidents, are reported annually and reviewed mid-year
through the LoR, which all reporting units are required to sign.
This 'bottom-up' report is checked against the risks reported
by the CRA, as well as against the findings from the internal
and external audits.
Our risk managers also support internal audits in their work of
checking the effectiveness of the internal controls, compliance
status, risk mitigations, and incident repairs.
The consolidated overview of all the aforementioned
monitoring is the basis for this risk section and the statements
of the Managing Board at the end of this section.
Control activities
Control activities ensure the safeguarding of our assets and
the integrity of our financial reporting. They help us to avoid
fraud and reputational damage and they also support the
statements of the Managing Board. We have implemented the
core of the internal control framework to bring relevant key
controls for its main supporting processes into an overarching
Internal Control Framework. Relevant function leads manage
their key controls, which will enable DSM and its stakeholders
to have a comprehensive oversight of all internal controls in
scope. Control activities are carried out by the responsible unit
managers and regularly reviewed in Risk Management
Committees. These activities include:
- Compliance with training requirements, segregation of
duties, and follow-up of audits of various stakeholders
- Execution, follow-up and quality of the relevant set of risk
assessments
- Best practices from internal and external sources to further
strengthen our risk management cycle as well as to ensure
appropriate risk management awareness and relevant
training for our employees
We apply a standard approach for monitoring ERP (Enterprise
Resource Planning) access controls, user provisioning and
privileged user management for the majority of our units.Information and communication
Continuous efforts are made to inform employees about the
DSM risk management system and to support and/or train
them in its use.
Assessment of the design and effectiveness of the risk
management and internal control system
Three lines of defense exist to manage risks.
First line: Line management within the units, executing risk
management and internal control activities.
Second line: Risk management, assessing the effectiveness
of the risk management and internal control activities, both at
unit and corporate level.
Third line: Corporate Operational Audit (COA), conducting
independent audits/reviews, some of these unannounced.
The scope and frequency of the COA audits is set according
to the ranking of the auditable units in terms of the magnitude
of risk, based on a limited number of defined characteristics.
This program has been agreed by the Executive Committee
and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
The internal audits conducted in 2018 did not indicate any
material failings in the design and effectiveness of our risk
management and internal control system.
Risks
The outcome of the CRA for Strategy 2021 in July 2018 and
the CRA review of December 2018 were reported to and
discussed with the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
This 'top-down' outcome corresponded very well with the
'bottom-up' risks and incidents as reported by all the individual
units in their respective Letter of Representation, as well as
with the findings from the internal and external audits. This final
risk profile was reported to and discussed with the Audit
Committee of the Supervisory Board in February 2019 and
forms the basis for the main risks and responses as reported
in the table.
Top risks
The table on the next page shows the four most important
risks that might prevent us from achieving the targets defined
in Strategy 2021. It also describes the mitigating actions we
are taking. Top risks have a potential impact on DSM's
EBITDA of an indicative € 30 million or more, or have a large
non-financial impact such as on reputation.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  120 www.dsm.comTop risks and related mitigating actions
 
Description of risks Mitigating actions
  
Product portfolio and purpose driven growth  
The quality and relevance of the current DSM portfolio of
products is fully reflected in the above-market growth rates
achieved in all businesses. To sustain this strong market
position DSM needs to continuously invest in its existing
products and invest in large innovation projects for which the
time to market is uncertain.
DSM also aims to execute value creating M&A,
predominantly in nutrition, to further evolve its portfolio. This
will require resources and could constitute a distraction
affecting the ongoing business performance.In order to sustain organic growth all business groups have
customer-centricity programs running. Upgrade of the sales
force and a more agile organization is part of these programs.
These programs will continue and, where needed, be
reinforced in 2019.
Top innovation projects are closely monitored, with a well-
established stage-gate approach and regular status reviews
with the Executive Committee. Where possible, time-to-
market is shortened via customer and/or innovation alliances,
such as the recently announced joint venture with Cargill to
introduce zero-calorie, cost-effective sweeteners.
To avoid distraction across the company, M&A initiatives are
managed centrally. Staffing has also been organized to ensure
flawless integrations while maintaining the running business
performance.
  
Market environment and competitive position  
DSM has created a streamlined and simplified business
portfolio and a good platform for growth, as 2018's results
have shown.
Nonetheless the risk remains of facing increased competition
for some product-market combinations, especially from low-
cost/margin players. DSM actively needs to manage its
competitive position, which includes capacity expansions for
selected products.The existing strength of the portfolio, as a result of continued
investments made in innovation, has resulted in a broadening
of DSM's product, application and customer base.
Nonetheless, customer-centricity programs have been
initiated to increase/protect the value captured. Increased
sales and marketing effectiveness is a key element of these
programs.
The company has a multi-year plan to ensure timely capacity
expansions and/or external sourcing to manage growth.
Operational continuous improvement programs also secure
maximum output from existing installations.
  
People, organization and culture  
In order to continue to deliver above-market growth and
retain strong operational efficiency, DSM requires a high-
quality pipeline of talents and effective people development.
While good progress has been made in talent management,
further improvements may be required to fully embed a
culture of customer-centricity, agility and cost-
consciousness to support the organization in its growth
ambitions.In order to have the right people and culture to sustain an
organic growth focus, DSM has initiated customer-centricity
programs across all business groups. The Strategy update
announced in June 2018 also emphasized strongly the actions
in place to support internationalization & diversity, leadership
development and culture (see page 42).
To make sure we make full use of our resources we will put
more focus on inclusive, agile and high-performing teams.
  
Operating in a digital world  
Despite a good track record and having procedural and
system controls in place, cybercrime constantly needs
attention to protect our assets and information. This risk is
exacerbated by the accelerating pace of digitalization.DSM has further strengthened its cyber security. A risk
assessment was performed for information technology and
operational technology systems in 2018. Specific programs
have been rolled out to improve cyber security of production
plants and R&D laboratory systems. Monitoring to detect
security incidents and incident response is in place. In 2018, a
new reporting dashboard was also developed to monitor
trends and enhance early detection of vulnerabilities.Corporate governance and risk management — Risk management
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  121 www.dsm.comAs part of the CRA for Strategy 2021, all risks from the previous
strategy were assessed in order to ascertain whether they are
top risks for the new strategy as well. The risks shown in the
top risk table are a combination of current and new top risks.
Emerging risks
The following three emerging risks have been identified by the
Executive Committee. They are being carefully monitored so
that we can take action or use them as new opportunities in a
timely manner.
1. Our Nutrition and Materials markets may be disrupted by
longer-term changes such as:
- New food preferences / food systems
- Potential impact of climate and health trends on animal
protein
- Innovations such as 3D printing
- Replacing fossil fuels by energy from renewable sources
- New mobility and transport options
This could create a risk if the speed of change in the world is
higher than our speed of adaptation to it.
2. We may not be able to adjust our environmental footprint
fast enough.
3. We may not be able to respond to climate change fast
enough in connection with:
- Sourcing risks
- Physical risks (e.g. in operations)
- Disruption to our end-markets (transitional risks)
At the same time, these emerging risks will also offer new
opportunities for our Brighter Living Solutions.
Other important risks
Besides the top risks reported in the previous table and other
emerging risks that need to be taken into account, there are
also some other important risks, sometimes of a more
operational nature. These include business continuity, product
liability, intellectual property, tax and digitalization risks. DSM
did not identify any significant company-specific risks
associated with Brexit, other than the general external
uncertainties around, for example, currency and other
economic developments associated with the different
scenarios for the UK exiting the EU.
Our risk management and internal control system has been
designed to monitor and respond to the maximum extent
possible.Enhancement of the risk management system
During 2018, the following major improvements were made to
our risk management framework:
- New global Risk Management organization rolled out
- Core of Internal Control Framework implemented
- Letter of Representation updated: specific attention for
Emerging risks and two new risk categories, Climate risks
and Internal Control risks
- To support the LoR submissions, dedicated sessions were
organized to discuss potential climate risks in more detail
with the individual business groups
- More focus on the quality of Risk Assessments (new Risk
Assessment Training Program and Manual)
- The DSM Cyber Fraud Awareness e-learning was
introduced for all our employees, to increase their
awareness of important types of cybercrime (ransomware,
man-in-the middle attack, fake CEO email)
As a standard practice, the Audit Committee of the
Supervisory Board was given detailed insight into the status of
our risk management system in 2018. This ensured that this
committee remained fully involved in, and aware of the status
of, and developments in, the dynamic process of enterprise
risk management and how it has the potential to help us to
achieve our strategic objectives.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  122 www.dsm.comStatements of the Managing Board
The Managing Board is responsible for the design and
operation of the internal risk management and control
systems. In discharging this responsibility, the Managing
Board has made a systematic assessment of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the internal control and risk
management systems.
On the basis of this report and in accordance with best
practice 1.4.3 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code of
December 2016, and Article 5:25c of the Financial Supervision
Act, the aforementioned assessment and the current state of
affairs, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the Managing
Board confirms that:
- The internal risk management and control systems of the
company provide reasonable assurance that financial
reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies
- There have been no material failings in the effectiveness of
the internal risk management and control systems of the
company
- There are no material risks or uncertainties that could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the continuity of DSM's operations in the coming twelve
months
- There is a reasonable expectation that DSM will be able to
continue its operations and meet its liabilities for at least
twelve months, therefore it is appropriate to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial reportingIt should be noted that the above does not imply that these
systems and procedures provide absolute assurance as to the
realization of operational and strategic business objectives, or
that they can prevent all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors,
fraud and non-compliances with legislation, rules and
regulations. Nor can they provide certainty that we will achieve
our objectives.
In view of all of the above, the Managing Board confirms that,
to the best of its knowledge and belief, the financial statements
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial
position and profit or loss of the company, and that the
management report includes a fair review of the position at the
balance sheet date and the development and performance of
the business during the financial year, together with a
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that the
company faces.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  123 www.dsm.comIntroduction by the Chair
x“ Our realization of our
company purpose was taken
to new heights in 2018.  ”
Rob Routs, Chair of the Supervisory Board
Dear reader,
As my colleagues and I on the Supervisory Board look back
on 2018, we do so with a feeling of pride in what our company
achieved during the strategic period 2016–2018 and how we
are now positioned to enter the next strategic phase of DSM's
development.
During the discussions that were to result in the updated
Strategy 2021: Growth & Value - Purpose led, Performance
driven , we were delighted to conclude that we had been so
successful in combining doing well with doing good that we
can now explicitly state that DSM is a purpose-led company.
Our realization of our company purpose — focusing on
improving our own approach, enabling others, and advocating
change to better serve the needs of people and planet — was
taken to new heights in 2018.
In terms of DSM's impact on the wider world, we were greatly
encouraged by the success of our first Supplier Partnership
Day, at which sustainability was a key topic, as well as by the
provision of a € 1 billion Revolving Credit Facility, where the
interest rate is linked to our reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions. Projects such as Project Clean Cow, Veramaris®,
Niaga® and Avansya, all of which will come to fruition in the
near future, are a testimony to the way we enable our business
partners to create a brighter world. In the Supervisory Board,
we regularly review these projects to ensure that we remain
on course to achieve our ambitions.
It would not be possible in the limited pages of this Report to
list all the opportunities our company takes and creates to
advocate positive actions for people and planet. But all the
recognition that DSM and its people received once more in
2018 strengthen us in our belief that we are on the right track.
The Supervisory Board is very pleased with the success of the
ambitious Strategy 2018, which sought to optimize the
performance of the group's portfolio of businesses while
delivering above-market growth. The accelerated progress
made during 2016 and 2017, however, left a significant
challenge during the final year of the strategic period — how
to deliver once again on the annual targets from a far higher
base than had been assumed in the original plans.
Nevertheless, a determined focus was maintained throughoutthe company, delivering above-market organic sales growth,
double-digit increase in EBITDA in the underlying business,
and an improvement in ROCE of more than 100 bps.
Furthermore, the company continued to deliver on a key
strategic promise by realizing significant value in the non-core
joint ventures, through exiting DSM Sinochem
Pharmaceuticals and the Fibrant business of ChemicaInvest.
Besides Sustainability, another core value at DSM is Safety.
We were deeply saddened by the tragic death of a contractor
at our Pecém site in Brazil in 2018, and have further intensified
our efforts to ensure permanent adherence to our company 
safety standards worldwide. This tragic event demonstrates
how we must be fully committed, both individually and
collectively, to the continuous raising of our safety standards
at all times and in all places at DSM, as well as in our own
private lives. Reflecting this commitment, the Supervisory
Board now commences every meeting with an update on the
company's safety performance. I am pleased to report that
during this year's visit to India — where DSM has a track
record of no recordable incidents for the fourth consecutive
year — it was clear that safety was top of the company's
agenda.
On behalf of my colleagues on the Supervisory Board, I would
like to thank our employees and leadership for the energy and
commitment that they brought to their work in 2018. Our
thanks also go to the many stakeholders who continue to
place their trust in our company. 2018 was a good year for
DSM. It has established a strong and resilient portfolio that
helped the company perform above its own targets and above
market, but also positions it well to face the challenges that
might lie ahead.
Report by the Supervisory Board
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  124 www.dsm.comSupervisory Board Report
This Report provides further information on the way the
Supervisory Board performed its duties in 2018. This concerns
supervising the policy pursued by the Managing Board, the
Managing Board's performance of its managerial duties, and
the general course of affairs within our company and its
businesses, as well as assisting the Managing Board with
advice, either upon request or proactively. Finally, these duties
also include assessing the Managing Board's performance
and ensuring that their remuneration is in line with that
performance and that it provides the appropriate incentives.
Since the inception of an Executive Committee, the
Supervisory Board has also been responsible for ensuring that
the checks and balances that are part of the two-tier
governance system are still taken into account, paying specific
attention to the dynamics between the Managing Board and
the Executive Committee.
The responsibility of supervising the policy pursued by the
Managing Board includes evaluating the way the Managing
Board implements DSM's strategy for long-term value
creation and promotes a culture aimed at that value. Since the
company's mission is to create brighter lives for people today
and generations to come, long-term value creation is
embedded both in the updated Strategy 2021: Growth &
Value - Purpose led, Performance driven  and in our company
culture. This is described in the chapters 'Strategy 2021' on
page 22, 'People' on page 42 and 'Corporate governance' on
page 108.
Composition of the Supervisory Board
The composition of DSM's Supervisory Board is diverse in
gender, nationality, background, knowledge and experience.
The Board comprises four men and three women. Two
members are Dutch, two American, one Dutch-American, one
British and one Singaporean. The Board's current members
are Rob Routs (Chair), Pauline van der Meer Mohr (Deputy
Chair), Victoria Haynes, Eileen Kennedy, Frits van Paasschen,
Pradeep Pant and John Ramsay. For detailed information on
their backgrounds, see the company website and 'Corporate
Governance' on page 108 of this Report.
Following best practice 2.1.10 of the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code, the Supervisory Board establishes that its
members are able to act critically and independently of one
another, the Managing Board and any particular interests
involved. To safeguard this, the Supervisory Board is
composed in such a way that all its members are independent
in the meaning of best practice 2.1.8 of the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code.
The targeted profile of the Supervisory Board is reflected in its
regulations, which are published on the company website
under 'Corporate Governance'. The Supervisory Board hasfour committees to cover key areas in greater detail: auditing,
nominations (to the Supervisory Board and Managing Board),
remuneration (of the Supervisory Board and Managing Board),
and sustainability. Information on these committees is given
elsewhere in this chapter. The charters of the committees are
published on the company website under 'Corporate
Governance'.
Relationship and stakeholder management
In performing its duties, the Supervisory Board acts in
accordance with the interests of the company and the
business connected with it, taking into consideration the
interests of the company's stakeholders. The Chair of the
Supervisory Board is in regular close contact with the CEO/
Chairman of the Managing Board, as is the Chair of the Audit
Committee with the CFO.
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board regularly interacts with
members of the Executive Committee who attend (parts of)
Supervisory Board meetings and participate in the yearly site
visit of the Supervisory Board.
The Supervisory Board interacts with DSM employees on
various occasions and in various settings. The Supervisory
Board regularly receives information on relevant topics from
senior leaders and experts in the company during committee
meetings, full Supervisory Board meetings, annual site visits,
and also as part of their ongoing professional education. In
2018, this was the case with respect to merger and acquisition
opportunities, the company's innovation and customer-
centricity and agility projects, its manufacturing policy, IT and
cyber security (both from an IT as well as an operations
perspective). During its annual site visit, the Supervisory Board
actively takes the opportunity to interact with employees at
different levels, from the shop floor to senior leadership, thus
collecting valuable information and insights from various
sources across the company.
Direct, one-on-one contact between Supervisory Board
members and Managing Board members generally follows
naturally from topics discussed in the Supervisory Board
meetings and reflects the members' respective fields of
expertise. In view of that expertise, Managing Board members
also seek the advice of Supervisory Board members on
specific matters. The same goes for contact with other
employees. For example, in 2018, Rob Routs was — given his
operations background in Shell, a company with a strong
safety culture — involved in the revision of the DSM Life Saving
Rules. Pradeep Pant, who is based in Singapore and has
extensive knowledge of and experience with Asian markets,
continued to be in regular contact with our senior
management in that region.
The Supervisory Board takes an active interest in maintaining
a good understanding of our stakeholders and their positionsReport by the Supervisory Board
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  125 www.dsm.comon various topics related to the company's areas of business.
This includes the perceptions of our shareholders. The
Supervisory Board is informed of the position of other DSM
stakeholders by the Managing Board. In addition, theSupervisory Board collects such information through its own
network.

3Tom de Swaan retired from the Supervisory Board as of the 2018 General Meeting of Shareholders, with Pauline van der Meer Mohr succeeding him in the role of Deputy Chair
as of the same date.
4Victoria Haynes had to miss the SB meeting on 9 May due to a prior commitment. Eileen Kennedy, John Ramsay and Frits van Paasschen missed an extra SB call planned at
short notice to discuss a potential pre-financial update; they all three called two days later to discuss the financial update just before publication of the pre-financial update.
Pradeep Pant missed the extra call on 30 May 2018 to prepare for the Capital Markets Day (CMD) which was planned in the course of 2018 following the decision to schedule
the CMD on 20 June 2018. He was able to call in for the extra SB conference call held on 14 June to finalize the preparation of the CMD. Pauline van der Meer Mohr missed the
SB conference call on 31 July 2018 due to a prior commitment. In addition, Eileen Kennedy had to miss the SB meeting of 8 October and the Sustainability Committee meeting
of 12 February, both for personal reasons.
Supervision and advice
The Supervisory Board performs its duties of supervising and
advising the Managing Board with respect both to recurring
standard agenda items for Supervisory Board meetings and
to specific topics that become relevant at any given point in
time.
The most prominent regular agenda item is an update on
business performance, financials and treasury topics. As part
of this agenda item, the Supervisory Board tracks the
company's financial performance, approves the annual
Finance and Capital Expenditure Plan, and deliberates on any
additional treasury topics as needed. In 2018, the Supervisory
Board discussed and approved the share buy-back program
to cover the company's commitments under existing
management and employee option and share plans and the
company's stock dividend policy.
In 2018, the Supervisory Board was actively involved in the
company's strategy update, including strategic direction and
target-setting for the years till 2021 as well as dividend
considerations, as presented during the Capital Markets Day
on 20 June. The Supervisory Board was also extensively
involved in the process for reviewing potential merger andacquisition targets and the monetization of DSM's stakes in
Fibrant and DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals.
At the Board's request, the Supervisory Board was updated
as to the company's global manufacturing plan. Customer-
centricity and agility projects are being rolled out throughout
the company, contributing to a top-line and customer-first
mindset. Given the importance of these projects, the
Supervisory Board did a deep dive on the project within DSM
Nutritional Products and will continue to follow the
implementation and effects of these projects going forward. In
addition, the Supervisory Board was updated and involved in
DSM's Innovation projects, such as Project Clean Cow,
Veramaris® and Avansya (fermentative Stevia). A continuous
education session was dedicated to updating the Supervisory
Board on the (latest) European and Dutch legislation and case
law on acquisitions and shareholder rights and obligations.
Site visits
Every year, the Supervisory Board visits DSM sites in a
particular region. This fosters interaction with employees
across different areas of the company and provides
Supervisory Board members with opportunities for continuing
education. This year's visit took the Supervisory Board to
India.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  126 www.dsm.comThe DSM Supervisory Board (from left to right): John Ramsay, Pauline van der Meer Mohr (Deputy Chair), Frits van Paasschen, Victoria Haynes,
Rob Routs (Chair), Eileen Kennedy and Pradeep Pant.
Following the visit to Switzerland in 2016 and to North America
in 2017, the 2018 site visit provided an overview of the
company's presence in India. It also gave an update on doing
business in India, drawing on the insights of external speakers.
The visit to India deepened the Board's understanding of
DSM's presence and business in India as well as the
opportunities that the country presents for the company.
The India visit began with a general overview of the company's
activities in India, a review of talent development in the country,
and a presentation from an external speaker providing an
introduction to India in general, focusing primarily on the
politics and economics of the country. A reception was
organized at the residence of the Dutch ambassador to India
for the Supervisory Board members to meet the company's
Indian partners and stakeholders, including several
customers. Throughout the week, the Board received updates
on the company's Solar, Functional Materials and Nutrition
(Animal Nutrition & Health and Human Nutrition & Health)
businesses in India. To stress the importance of customer-
centricity, the Supervisory Board aims to meet with customers
during each site visit. In India, the Board visited Sterlite
Technologies, a DSM customer which is a leading global
provider of optical fiber.The Supervisory Board then traveled to DSM Engineering
Plastics in Pune — a site with high SHE standards and a low
environmental footprint. The visit included a plant tour, a visit
to the solar field, interactions with employees and participation
in a townhall meeting. The townhall meeting was broadcast
live via audio across all our sites in India.
In the second half of the week spent in India, the Supervisory
Board was updated on the complete services provided
globally to DSM from our India-based Shared Service Center.
This update included a visit to Tata Consultancy Services
(TCS), one of our partners in Information Technology.
Furthermore, the Board took the opportunity to meet with
DSM's India leadership and talents.
Finally, time was taken to reflect on the site visit with the
participating Executive Committee members. Supervisory
Board members shared their impressions and offered specific
advice about doing business in India, and also about the talent
development process. Both Supervisory Board and Executive
Committee concurred on the relevance of India for the
company and the importance of continuing to strengthen our
presence there.Report by the Supervisory Board
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  127 www.dsm.comSupervisory Board meetings and performance evaluation
In 2018, the Supervisory Board held its five regular meetings
and one regular call in the presence of the Managing Board,
as well as four additional calls in the presence of the Managing
Board, in order to be able to dedicate sufficient time to the
company's business and financial performance as well as the
strategy update process. Information on attendance of Board
and Committee meetings can be found on page 126.
The Supervisory Board also convenes in the absence of the
Managing Board, which usually happens before each meeting.
An evaluation of the Supervisory Board is performed once
every three years by an external advisor; this was the case in
2016. In the other two years, the evaluation of the Supervisory
Board is performed by means of a self-assessment consisting
of a written questionnaire, followed by in-depth, one-on-one
interviews between the Chair and individual Supervisory Board
members.
As part of this evaluation, not only the collective performance
of the Supervisory Board and its Committees, but also that of
individual Supervisory Board members, was evaluated and
members received feedback in the interviews conducted by
the Chair. Furthermore, the Deputy Chair interacted with all
Supervisory Board members to assess the performance of the
Chair. The outcome of the evaluation was presented to, and
discussed with, the Supervisory Board in December, in the
absence of the Managing Board. While the Managing Board's
performance is also assessed as part of the evaluation, this
happens throughout the year as part of the discussions on
succession planning in the Nomination Committee, and
particularly when the performance appraisals of the Managing
Board members are discussed, as well as their performance
versus their individual targets in the Remuneration Committee.
The Nomination and Remuneration Committees report back
on these discussions to the Supervisory Board.
The overall feedback from the evaluation in 2018 was that the
Supervisory Board members feel the Board generally
functions well. Critical issues are raised and addressed
adequately. The decision-making process is regarded as
efficient. As it was recognized that is was sometimes difficult
to find sufficient time to discuss all items on the agenda, it was
agreed to extend the available meeting time. Besides the
regularly scheduled topics, the main topics identified for focus
in the coming years were the implementation of the new
strategy and portfolio management, as well as new product
innovation and unlocking value. Given the importance of
people for the company's success, it was agreed to give the
Supervisory Board more exposure to the company's talents.
Finally, the Board Committees are also deemed to be
operating well and the feedback of the discussions to the full
Board ensures that all Supervisory Board members are familiar
with the issues discussed in the Committees.Committees
The Supervisory Board has four committees to cover key
areas in greater detail: nominations, remuneration,
sustainability and auditing. These are described in more detail
below.
Board nominations
The Nomination Committee comprises Rob Routs (Chair),
Eileen Kennedy and Pauline van der Meer Mohr. Feike
Sijbesma and Judith Wiese, Executive Vice President Group
People & Organization, were also involved in this Committee's
discussions. The Committee met five times in 2018. The
recommendations and minutes of all Nomination Committee
meetings were shared with the entire Supervisory Board. This
feedback included advice and recommendations regarding
topics to be approved by the full Supervisory Board. The
Supervisory Board also has access to all the meeting materials
posted for the Nomination Committee meetings.
In 2018, nomination discussions focused on succession
planning for both the Managing Board and the Supervisory
Board. With respect to the Managing Board, the discussions
focused on the talent pipeline available for the succession of
Managing Board members.
The Supervisory Board established that the composition of the
Managing Board is diverse in nationality (with two Dutch
citizens, and one member with joint Swiss, British and French
citizenship), gender (two men, one woman), background,
knowledge and experience, and that it provides a good
foundation to support all clusters and business groups in
achieving their targets and thus in contributing to the company
strategy. For detailed background information on all Managing
Board members, see the company website under 'Corporate
Governance' and page 137 of this Report.
Taking into account the Supervisory Board profile as laid down
in the Supervisory Board regulations, the Nomination
Committee continued discussions on the overall composition
of the Supervisory Board and discussed succession planning
for the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board decided to
propose Pauline van der Meer Mohr for re-appointment for a
two-year term at the 2019 Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders. The Supervisory Board decided to do so on the
basis of her broad human resource management, corporate
governance and international business experience, her
extensive experience and qualities as a Supervisory Board
member, as demonstrated during her past period as a
member of DSM's Supervisory Board. In 2018, the
Nomination Committee also discussed several profiles that
could be added to the Supervisory Board. The results of these
discussions will be announced with the agenda for the 2019
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  128 www.dsm.comBoard remuneration
The Remuneration Committee had five meetings in 2018.
Pauline van der Meer Mohr (Chair), Victoria Haynes, Rob
Routs, Tom de Swaan (until the General Meeting of
Shareholders of 2018) and John Ramsay (as of the General
Meeting of Shareholders of 2018) are members of this
committee. Recommendations and minutes of the
Remuneration Committee meetings were shared with the full
Supervisory Board and were used to determine the final
remuneration of the members of the Managing Board. The
Supervisory Board also has access to all the meeting materials
posted for the Remuneration Committee meetings. For more
information on the remuneration policy see 'Remuneration
policy Managing Board' on page 131 and implementation of
that policy in 2018, see 'Remuneration of Managing Board and
Supervisory Board' on page 224.
Discussions focused on the performance and the related
remuneration of the members of the Managing Board, in
respect of both company and individual performance in 2018.
The majority of discussion time in 2018 was spent on possible
adjustments to the company's remuneration policy. A
corresponding proposal will be submitted to the 2019 Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders for approval. The
performance and remuneration of the Executive Committee
members were also shared with the Remuneration
Committee. Feike Sijbesma and Judith Wiese were also partly
involved in these discussions.
Sustainability
The Sustainability Committee prepares the Supervisory
Board's discussions on sustainability topics. The Sustainability
Committee met three times in 2018. This Committee
comprises Eileen Kennedy (Chair), Pradeep Pant and Frits van
Paasschen. The Chair of the Supervisory Board has a standing
invitation, and participated in all meetings. The
recommendations and minutes of these meetings were
shared and discussed with the entire Supervisory Board
during its meetings with the Managing Board. The Supervisory
Board also has access to all the meeting materials posted for
the Sustainability Committee meetings. The feedback from the
Committee to the full Board included advice and
recommendations regarding topics to be approved by the
Supervisory Board, in particular the sustainability reporting in
this Report. Taking into consideration the 'Assurance report
of the independent auditor' on the sustainability information by
KPMG on page 235 of this Report, the full Supervisory Board
approved the reporting in these sections on 27 February 2019.
The Sustainability Information complies with the Standards of
the Global Reporting Initiative and our internal reporting
criteria, which are included in this Report, and is also aligned
with the international Integrated Reporting Council <IR>
Framework where possible.
During the year, a recurring topic was the company's
performance against its People and Planet aspirations, with afocus on Brighter Living Solutions, responsible care, and
inclusion and diversity. Through these discussions, the
Sustainability Committee followed up on the progress made
with the implementation of the sustainability and safety
aspirations set as part of Strategy 2018. Deep dives were
made into several topics. One was on preparing for a low-
carbon future as well as setting science-based targets. The
Committee discussed actions that were being undertaken to
further future-proof the company by improving our climate
impact and climate risk exposure, by enabling a low-carbon
economy, and by advocating appropriate action externally and
internally. Other topics addressed more extensively were
Safety (including the revitalization of DSM's Life Saving Rules),
the outcome of the Employee Engagement Survey, and finally,
the process through which the company identifies risk and
materiality topics and how these processes are intertwined.
Furthermore, the Committee was updated on DSM's
performance in the various Environmental, Social and
Governance indices such as CDP, Sustainalytics, Fortune's
'Change the World' list and the Dow Jones Sustainability
World Index.
Financials and auditing
The activities of the Supervisory Board in the area of financials
and auditing are prepared by the Audit Committee. The Audit
Committee met five times in 2018, three of these times via
conference call. Tom de Swaan (Chair until the 2018 Annual
General Meeting), John Ramsay (Chair as of the 2018 Annual
General Meeting), Victoria Haynes, Pradeep Pant and Frits van
Paasschen are members of the Audit Committee. The Chair
of the Supervisory Board participated in all meetings and calls.
All Supervisory Board members have a standing invitation to
attend Audit Committee meetings; in 2018, they used this
standing invitation for the two conference calls in which the
financial developments and interim results for the first and third
quarter were discussed, as these are not followed by a full
Board meeting. The highlights and the minutes of all Audit
Committee meetings were shared with the full Supervisory
Board. This feedback included advice and recommendations
regarding topics to be approved by the full Supervisory Board.
In 2018, these included the appointment of the SVP of
Corporate Operational Audit (COA) as proposed by the
Managing Board, the approval of the 2019 COA Audit plan
and the proposed reappointment of the external auditor (to be
approved by the 2019 Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders). All Supervisory Board members also have
access to all the meeting materials posted for the Audit
Committee meetings.
DSM's external auditor KPMG and the CFO participated in the
Audit Committee's meetings and calls. The CEO participated
in the Audit Committee meetings and the call in which the half-
year results were discussed. The managers responsible for
corporate control, internal audit, risk management and
compliance also participated in these two meetings and thisReport by the Supervisory Board
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  129 www.dsm.comcall. The manager responsible for corporate control also
participated in the two calls in which the financial
developments and interim results for the first and third quarter
were discussed.
At least once a year, the Audit Committee meets with the
external auditor without the Managing Board being present.
Two such meetings took place in 2018. 
The Committee had in-depth discussions on the company's
financials; the Finance plan; the Capital Expenditure plan;
dividend proposals; the financial statements; accounting
policy changes; internal risk management and control
systems; potential risks (including Safety, Health and
Environment and security risks); compliance with
recommendations and observations made by internal and
external auditors; and the role and functioning of COA,
including the endorsement of its proposed audit plan for 2019,
which was subsequently approved by the full Board. As part
of the Corporate Risk Assessment, the company's main risks
and their mitigation were discussed. The Committee also
discussed and evaluated cases submitted under the company
whistleblower policy (DSM Alert), fraud cases, and on-going
litigation. All these discussions included mitigating actions to
prevent recurrence.
Discussions were held with KPMG about the audit plan,
management letter, audit report and financial statements for
2018, including management's judgments and key
accounting estimates. In its management letter KPMG shared
the outcome of its evaluation of the company's procedures
and system of internal controls to the extent necessary within
the scope of the audit of the financial statements. The
observations of KPMG were presented along the pillars that
support DSM's in-control statement (for the 'Statements of the
Managing Board' see page 123, and for a visualization of
DSM's control environment see page 110 ). The management
letter contained constructive recommendations for further
strengthening of DSM's internal controls. The most important
element was KPMG's encouragement to continue to take the
pillar 'Internal Control Framework' to a higher level of maturity.
In line with our own assessment no material weaknesses were
reported by KPMG.
Finally, in 2018, the Audit Committee formally evaluated the
external auditor, and discussed the reappointment of KPMG.
Other specific topics addressed during the Audit Committee
meetings in 2018 were cyber security, both from an IT and an
Operations perspective, and the internal control framework.Financial statements 2018
The Report by the Managing Board and the financial
statements for 2018 were submitted by the Managing Board
to the Supervisory Board, in accordance with the provisions
of Article 30 of the Articles of Association, and were
subsequently approved by the Supervisory Board on 27
February 2019. The financial statements were audited by
KPMG, who issued an unqualified opinion (see the
'Independent auditor's report'). The Supervisory Board
established that the external auditor was independent of DSM.
The Supervisory Board will submit the 2018 financial
statements to the 2019 Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders, and will propose that the shareholders adopt
them and release the Managing Board from all liability in
respect of its managerial activities and release the Supervisory
Board from all liability in respect of its supervision of the
Managing Board. The profit appropriation as proposed by the
Managing Board and approved by the Supervisory Board is
presented in the 'Profit' section of this Report, starting on page
58.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  130 www.dsm.comRemuneration policy Managing Board
This chapter outlines the remuneration policy as approved by
the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in 2013. Details
of the actual remuneration in 2018 as prepared by the
Remuneration Committee and approved by the Supervisory
Board can be found in Note 13 of the 'Parent company
financial statements', on page 224.
Remuneration policy
The objective of DSM's remuneration policy is to attract,
reward, motivate, incentivize and retain qualified and expert
leaders that the company needs to achieve its strategic and
operational objectives, with the right organizational set-up,
while acknowledging the societal context around
remuneration and recognizing the interests of DSM's
stakeholders. The following elements are taken into
consideration:
- The remuneration policy reflects a balance between the
interests of DSM's main stakeholders as well as a balance
between the company's short-term and long-term strategy.
As a result, the structure of the remuneration package for
the Managing Board is designed to balance short-term
operational performance with the medium- and long-term
objective of creating sustainable value within the company,
while considering the interests of all of its stakeholders. DSM
sets a clear strategic direction and executes this with agility.
DSM strives for high financial performance, as well as in the
field of sustainability, and aims to maintain a good balance
between economic gain, respect for people and concern for
the environment, in line with the DSM values and business
principles as reflected in the DSM Code of Business
Conduct
-To ensure that highly skilled and qualified senior executives
can be attracted, motivated and retained, DSM aims for a
total remuneration level that is comparable to levels
provided by other (Dutch and European) multinational
companies that are similar to DSM in terms of their size and
complexity
-The remuneration policies for the members of the Managing
Board and for other Executive Committee members, as well
as for other senior executives of DSM, are aligned
- In designing and setting the levels of remuneration for the
Managing Board, the Supervisory Board also takes into
account the relevant statutory provisions and the provisions
of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, societal and
market trends, and the interests of stakeholders
- DSM's policy is to offer the Managing Board a total direct
compensation approaching — from below — the median of
the labor-market peer group
No adjustments to the remuneration policy for the Managing
Board in 2018
There were no adjustments to DSM's remuneration policy in
2018. The policy was last adjusted in 2013. The policy is
designed to provide fair compensation approaching themedian, and consists of a base salary and a well-balanced mix
of Short-Term and Long-Term Incentives. Both the Short-
Term Incentive (STI) and the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) consist
of two equal parts, one of which is linked to financial targets
and the other to sustainability plus — for STI only — individual
targets. The policy is currently under review; changes (if any)
will be presented to the 2019 Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders, but without changing the current Annual Base
Pay, STI and LTI structure.
Labor-market peer group
To be able to attract the right leaders and to secure long-term
retention of the current Managing Board members, DSM takes
external reference data into account in determining adequate
remuneration levels. For this purpose, a specific labor-market
peer group has been defined, containing a number of Dutch
and European companies that are more or less comparable
to DSM in terms of size, international scope and the complexity
of their business portfolio. The Supervisory Board regularly
reviews this peer group to ensure that its composition is still
appropriate. The latest review was conducted in the fourth
quarter of 2017 and did not result in a change in the current
composition of DSM's labor-market peer group. As a result of
this, the labor-market peer group for 2018 consisted of the
following 16 companies (eight of which are peers on the
Amsterdam stock exchange, the other eight being European
industry peers):
AkzoNobel KPN
ASML LANXESS
Clariant Lonza
Covestro Philips
Evonik Randstad
Givaudan RELX
Heineken Solvay
Johnson Matthey Wolters Kluwer
The review in the Supervisory Board end 2018 resulted in the replacement of
RELX by Ahold Delhaize as of 2019.
DSM will benchmark its remuneration package against the
packages offered by the labor-market peer group once every
three years, potentially leading to adjustments. In addition, the
company may apply a yearly increase to the base salary based
on the 'general increase' (market movement) for DSM
executives in the Netherlands.
The remuneration policy was benchmarked against the peer
group in the fourth quarter of 2017. DSM aims to offer
Managing Board members a total direct compensation
approaching the median of the labor-market peer group. The
Supervisory Board of DSM has determined that the
remuneration level of the CEO was for many years clearly lower
than the median of the predetermined peer group (in the first,
lowest quartile). This is due to the conservative approach ofReport by the Supervisory Board — Remuneration policy Managing Board
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  131 www.dsm.comthe CEO regarding his own remuneration. The remuneration
of the other members of the Managing Board is between first
quartile and median level.
Total Direct Compensation
The Total Direct Compensation of the Managing Board
consists of the following components:
(I) Base salary
(II) Variable income 
- Performance-related STI (Deferral and Share Matching
Plan) 
- Performance-related LTI (Restricted Share Plan)
In addition to this Total Direct Compensation, members of the
Managing Board participate in the Dutch pension scheme for
DSM employees in the Netherlands, and are entitled to other
benefits, such as a company car and representation
allowance.
Value as percentage of Total Direct Compensation (on target):
A: Base salary 50%
B: Variable income (STI + LTI)150%
  
Total Direct Compensation 100%
1LTI at discounted fair value; at face value, the LTI is 100% of base salary.
Base salary
The policy is that the Managing Board members receive a base
salary approaching the median of the labor-market peer
group. Base salary levels are reviewed based on a three-year
remuneration benchmark. In addition, the company will, when
appropriate, apply a yearly increase to the base salary taking
into account the 'general increase' (market movement) for
DSM executives in the Netherlands, as well as the general
movements of the labor-market peer group.
Variable income
The variable income part of remuneration consists of the
Short-Term and Long-Term Incentives. The distribution
between Short-Term and Long-Term Incentives for (on-target)
performance aims to achieve a proper balance between short-
term result and long-term value creation. The parameters
relating to the various elements of the variable income part of
the remuneration are established and, where necessary
adjusted by, and at the discretion of, the Supervisory Board,
taking into account the general rules and principles of the
remuneration policy itself. Distribution of variable income (on-
target):A: Short-Term Incentive (STI) 
(50% base salary) 50%
B: Long-Term Incentive (LTI)

Total variable income as % of base salary 100%
1LTI at discounted fair value; at face value, the LTI is 100% of base salary.
Short-Term Incentive (STI)
Managing Board members are eligible to participate in an STI
scheme. The scheme is designed to reward short-term
operational performance with the long-term objective of
creating sustainable value, taking into account the interests of
all stakeholders.
The STI opportunity amounts to 50% of the annual base salary
for on-target performance (100% in the case of excellent over-
performance). Half of the STI opportunity (i.e. 25% of base
salary at on-target performance) is related to financial targets,
the other half to sustainability and individual targets.

STI linked to financial targets
The part of the STI that is linked to shared financial targets (for
on-target performance, 25% of base salary) consists of
elements related to the company's focus on delivering the
financial targets of its strategy: Adjusted EBITDA, which
represents an opportunity at target performance of 12.5%;
gross free cash flow, with an opportunity of 10%; and organic
net sales growth, with a 2.5% opportunity.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  132 www.dsm.comSTI linked to sustainability and individual targets
The part of the STI that is linked to shared sustainability as well
as to individual targets, represents 25% of base salary for on-
target performance. Further refinement/adaptations of
performance measures in the area of sustainability and their
relative weight may take place following proper evaluation.
The following shared measures linked to sustainability are
applicable for the STI:
- Brighter Living Solutions (BLS): percentage of running
business that meets ECO+ and People+ criteria (products
that offer a better environmental or social benefit compared
to mainstream reference solutions)
- Employee Engagement Index: related to the High-
Performance Norm in industry
- Safety Performance: defined as Frequency Index for
Recordable Injuries
Definitions of these elements can be found in 'Explanation of
some concepts and ratios' on page 242 and 'People' on page
42.
In addition to shared sustainability targets (15%), a limited
number of individual (financial and non-financial) targets (10%)
will apply.
Target areas On-target pay-out
(% of base salary)
- Sustainability (three targets with an equal
weight of 5% each; BLS, Employee
Engagement and Safety) 15
- Individual (financial and non-financial) 10
  
Total 25
The targets are determined each year by the Supervisory
Board, based on historical performance, the operational and
strategic outlook of the company in the short term, and the
expectations of the company's management and
stakeholders, among other things. The targets contribute to
the realization of the objective of long-term value creation.
The company does not disclose the exact actual targets, as
these qualify as commercially sensitive information, though
they are in line with the published strategic, financial and
sustainability goals of the company. Full transparency will be
given on target areas and definitions. The external auditors
performed agreed-upon mandate procedures on target-
setting and realization. For detailed information, see Note 13
'Remuneration of Managing Board and Supervisory Board' on
page 224 of the 'Parent company financial statements'.
Mandatory and voluntary deferral of STI
A mandatory proportion (25%) and a voluntary proportion (up
to a total maximum of 50% of the total gross STI) of the STIamount earned in a year is deferred into DSM shares with a
three-year holding period. This is linked to a one-for-one
matching award on the total deferred amount under the
condition that predefined performance targets and measures
are met at the end of the three-year vesting period. The
performance measures are equivalent to the measures under
the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Deferral and Share
Matching Plan thus provides an additional link between
Managing Board remuneration and long-term sustainable
value creation.
Long-Term Incentives (LTI)
The Managing Board members are eligible to receive
performance-related shares. Under the Performance Share
Plan, shares will conditionally be granted to Managing Board
members. Vesting of these shares is conditional on the
achievement of certain predetermined performance targets at
the end of a three-year period. The following four performance
measures are, equally weighted, applicable for the calculation
of the vesting of LTI Performance Shares:
- Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance
versus a peer group
- Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) growth
- Energy Efficiency Improvement (EEI)
-Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE) Efficiency Improvement
The LTI performance targets are defined as follows:
-Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)  
This is used to compare the performance of different
companies' stocks and shares over time. It combines share
price appreciation and dividends paid to show the total
return to shareholders. The relative TSR position reflects the
market perception of overall performance relative to a
reference group.
-Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) growth
This is the operating profit as a percentage of weighted
average capital employed.
-Energy Efficiency Improvement (EEI)  
This is the reduction of the amount of energy that is used
per unit of product (known as energy efficiency) on a three-
year rolling average basis.
-Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE) Efficiency
Improvement
This is the reduction of the amount of greenhouse gas
emissions per unit of product. The definition of greenhouse
gases (GHG) according to the Kyoto Protocol includes
carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane, nitrous oxide (N 2O), sulfur
hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons.
The scope for calculation of GHGE reduction is as follows:
(I) DSM's direct emissions (on-site or from DSM assets)
mainly comprise CO 2 (scope 1)
(II)DSM's indirect emissions (emissions created on behalf
of DSM in the generation of electricity or the delivery of
energy via hot water or steam) relate to electricity from
the grid. DSM relies on local suppliers (scope 2)Report by the Supervisory Board — Remuneration policy Managing Board
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  133 www.dsm.comIn determining the number of shares to be conditionally
granted, the Supervisory Board takes into account the face
value of the DSM share instead of the discounted fair value.
This is in line with best practice and provides total
transparency to shareholders. The policy for the value of the
LTI is set at 100% of base salary for on-target performance
and 150% in the case of excellent over-performance (face
value; at fair value this would be 50% and 75%). The number
of conditionally granted shares is set by dividing the policy level
at maximum (150% of base salary) by a share price at the
beginning of the year of the conditional grant; as a result of
this, the number of shares granted annually may fluctuate.
Granting date
The grant date of the conditional Performance Shares will be
the last trading day of March.
TSR as a performance measure
TSR counts for the vesting of 25% of the performance shares.
DSM's TSR performance is compared to the average TSR
performance of a set of predefined peer companies. The TSR
peer group for the 2018 performance period consists of the
following 14 companies (no change compared to 2017):
AkzoNobel Evonik
Arkema Givaudan
BASF Kerry
Christian Hansen LANXESS
Clariant Lonza Group
Croda International Novozymes
DowDuPont Solvay
The review of the Remuneration Policy resulted in the replacement of AkzoNobel
and LANXESS by Celanese and Symrise as of 2019.The TSR peer group reflects the relevant market which DSM's
Supervisory Board considers to be suitable benchmarks for
DSM.
The peer group is verified and updated by the Supervisory
Board each year based on market circumstances (such as
mergers and acquisitions) that determine the appropriateness
of the composition of the performance peer group.
ROCE growth as a performance measure
ROCE growth counts for the vesting of 25% of the
performance shares.
EEI as a performance measure
EEI counts for the vesting of 25% of the performance shares.
GHGE Efficiency Improvement as a performance measure
GHGE Efficiency Improvement in percentage points (over a
three-year period) is used as a basis for the vesting of 25% of
the performance shares.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  134 www.dsm.comThe ROCE target and vesting scheme is not disclosed, given
the business-sensitive nature, but target setting is in line with
published strategic goals.
The retention period for performance shares expires five years
after the three-year vesting period or at termination of
employment, if this occurs earlier. The final TSR performance
of DSM versus its peers will be determined and agreed-upon
mandate procedures are performed by the external auditor at
the end of the vesting period.
Pensions
The members of the Managing Board participate in the Dutch
pension fund Stichting Pensioenfonds DSM Nederland (PDN).
This pension scheme for the Managing Board is equal to the
pension scheme for the employees of DSM Executive Services
B.V. and DSM employees in the Netherlands.

Managing Board members who joined DSM prior to 1 January
2013 are engaged on the basis of an individual employment
agreement for an indefinite period of time. Managing Board
members joining the company after 1 January 2013 are
engaged on the basis of a Management Services Agreement
with a four-year term, to be renewed at reappointment.
Term of appointment
Members of the Managing Board appointed before 1 January
2005 are appointed for an indefinite period of time. Managing
Board members appointed after 1 January 2005 are
appointed for a period of four years, after which they are
eligible for reappointment by the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders.
Notice period
Resignation by a member of the Managing Board is subject to
three months' notice (six months in case of a Management
Services Agreement). A notice period of six months applies in
the event of termination by the company.
Severance arrangement
There are no specific contractual exit arrangements for
members of the Managing Board appointed before 1 January
2005. Should a situation arise in which a severance payment
is appropriate for such a Board member, the Remuneration
Committee will recommend the terms and conditions. The
Supervisory Board will decide upon this, taking into account
usual practices for these types of situations, as well as
applicable laws and corporate governance requirements.
Members of the Managing Board appointed after 1 January
2005 are covered by a severance provision in accordance with
the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, which is set at a
maximum of one annual base salary.Claw-back / change-of-control
Legislation entered into force regarding the revision and claw-
back of bonuses and profit-sharing arrangements of board
members of Dutch listed companies as of January 2014. Part
of this legislation was already covered in comparable rules of
the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and consequently
already included in the employment contracts of the members
of the Managing Board. This regards in particular the
possibility (1) to revise an incentive prior to payment, if
unaltered payment of the bonus/incentive would be
unreasonable and unfair, and (2) to claw back an incentive, if
payment took place on the basis of incorrect information on
the fulfilment of the incentive targets or the conditions for
payment of the incentive.
Share ownership
The Supervisory Board encourages the Managing Board to
hold shares in the company to emphasize its confidence in the
strategy and performance of the company.
Minimum shareholding guidelines for the members of the
Managing Board are applicable, equivalent to three times the
base salary in the case of the CEO and one time the base
salary for the other Managing Board members. These
shareholdings can be built up over five years. For more
information, see the position paper 'Royal DSM's position on
Board Member shareholdings in the company' on the
company website.
Loans
DSM does not provide any loans to members of the Managing
Board.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  137 www.dsm.comWe are always trying to improve, but sometimes things still go
wrong. Here we share the most significant incidents of 2018
across all three dimensions of People, Planet and Profit. This
includes health, safety, environment, and security incidents as
well as what we have learned from business that has not
developed as planned.
Preventing repeat problems requires us to understand each
incident to the best of our ability. When a problem occurs, we
take care of any injuries, repair any damage, and act
throughout with compassion. We also trigger an improvement
cycle (see 'Safety, health & wellness' on page 44). This
includes investigating root causes and trying to eliminate them.
We put new requirements or operating procedures in place as
needed.
We apply zero tolerance to violations of the 'DSM Code of
Business Conduct' (see page 115). We do not disclose any
personal details in cases involving individuals.
In line with our reporting policy, this overview includes
incidents and some serious near-misses. Near-misses are
cases that did not result in injury, illness or damage but which
could have done so. Even when crisis is averted, it is our
responsibility to learn from it and do better the next time. DSM
has a process in place to collect the information about
incidents and some serious near-misses as presented in this
overview, using various sources including our internal Letter of
Representation (see 'Monitoring activities' in 'Risk
management' on page 120) and our reporting system for SHE
and Security incidents.
People
Incident resulting in a fatality
A tragic accident took place at DSM Nutritional Products in
Pecém (Brazil). As a sea container was being prepared for
unloading, one of its doors opened very forcefully, because a
large bag had shifted position and was pressing against the
inside of the door. A contractor was hit by the container door
and lost his life. The root causes have been thoroughly
investigated and the lessons learned are being implemented.
We are committed to the safety of all workers and will continue
to pay close attention to contractor safety. We are supporting
the affected families.
Other logistic incidents
At DSM Nutritional Products in Venlo (Netherlands) a
contractor was caught by a reversing forklift truck. He suffered
bruises to his foot and a laceration to his right elbow that
required three stitches.
At DSM Nederland in Geleen (Netherlands) a contractor was
injured in the face and sustained a fracture to the jaw while
unloading a container with road plates for a demolition area.As a result of the fatal incident and these two logistical
incidents, we have included transport and warehouse safety
in our revision of the DSM Life Saving Rules, leading to
improved standards on warehouse safety across the whole of
DSM.
Incidents involving falls
At DSM Food Specialties in Seclin (France) an employee
slipped from the second rung of a ladder, falling to the ground.
The ladder toppled over and landed on him, causing a broken
thumb.
At DSM Resins and Functional Materials in Meppen (Germany)
a taxi driver delivering mail to the site fell to the ground while
passing through a doorway, resulting in a broken shoulder.
Other safety incidents
At DSM Nutritional Products in Sisseln (Switzerland) a
research employee analyzing samples experienced a severe
skin reaction. There were no indications of incorrect handling
or a spill of any kind and the employee was wearing the
required personal protective equipment (gloves, safety
goggles, and lab coat). The skin disorders observed were
diagnosed as an acute allergy and the employee was
exempted from this type of work in the future.
At DSM Engineering Plastics in Emmen (Netherlands) a fire
damaged a part of the copolymerization control room. The
cause of the fire is still under investigation.
At DSM Nutritional Products in Sisseln (Switzerland) three
employees were working near a pump when the pump started
to emit smoke and burst. The employees were contaminated
with 1-pentol and were taken to hospital for treatment. The
plant design has been reviewed and thorough actions have
been taken to avoid similar accidents from reoccurring.
At DSM Nutritional Products in Jiangshan (Jiangsu Province,
China) an employee lost three fingers of his left hand when they
got caught in a running rotary valve, as the installed fixed guard
had been removed. The application of the Machine Safety
Standards on site has been reviewed and embedded in the
inspection and maintenance system.
At DSM Nutritional Products in Sisseln (Switzerland) a
contractor closing an elevator door had his middle finger
caught between the elevator door and the door frame. The
contractor's fingertip and nail were severely injured, and the
contractor was taken to hospital for treatment.
At DSM Nutritional Products in Grenzach (Germany) an
employee suffered abrasions to his thigh and bruised his foot.
He was using a lifting system to maneuver a barrel when
suddenly the barrel fell out of the lifting system and injured his
leg and foot. The lifting system was taken out of service for
further investigation.What still went wrong in 2018
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  138 www.dsm.comAt DSM Nutritional Products in Ames (Iowa, USA) an employee
engaged in resealing a bag with an electric hand-held stitcher
lost the top of his left index finger. The bag got jammed in the
stitcher and the employee's finger was injured as he tried to
release it. The stitcher was taken out of operation and a
thorough review of machine safety risk assessments in the
region has been completed.
At DSM Nutritional Products in Lima (Peru) a contractor was
engaged in installing a new process filter. Working at a level
below this contractor was another contractor, who was
unaware of the potential risk posed by the activity being carried
out above him and who omitted to look up. The bottom part
of the filter that was being installed fell down and hit the
contractor's thumb, resulting in a severe contusion and
multiple bone fractures. As corrective actions, contractors at
the site were retrained, safety supervision and inspections
were ramped up, and the work permit process was
strengthened.
At DSM Nutritional Products in Grenzach (Germany), chemical
substances were released due to an unexpectedly violent
reaction. The released chemical cloud was contained with
water by fire fighters. No one was injured and no chemical
substances were detected outside the building. The cause of
the incident is still under investigation.
Privacy incidents
An email invitation was unintentionally sent to 37,000 email
addresses in- and outside DSM due to an incorrect attribute
in a dynamic distribution list. The incident was reported to the
Dutch Privacy Authority.
Planet
At DSM Nutritional Products in Piura (Peru) untreated
wastewater containing oils and fats was discharged to an
external drain. On discovery, the discharge was immediately
stopped, and the external drain was cleaned up to the extent
possible.
At DSM Nutritional Products in Grenzach (Germany) a leakage
occurred in one of the bioreactors of the waste water
treatment plant, requiring a shutdown of the plant for a week.
This required some production units on the site to operate at
reduced capacity for several days.
Profit
A product recall in the US was necessary for our process
flavors that were blended by a third party on behalf of DSM
Food Specialties, leading to claims from customers.
DSM Food Specialties in Delft (Netherlands) suffered a
temporary lower output as a result of issues in fermentation.
This required longer than anticipated to resolve.At DSM Nutritional Products in Buenos Aires (Argentina) a fire
destroyed a building that housed offices, a warehouse and
three mixing lines for animal nutrition. All operations and office
activities were stopped, temporarily transferred to other
locations and resumed within three months after the incident
occurred.
At DSM Nutritional Products in Brazil our animal nutrition
business was hit by a truck drivers' strike, severely impacting
the production and shipment of products to our customers.
At DSM Innovation Center an email was received from an
online hacker claiming to be DSM's CEO, requesting
assistance for an urgent money transfer. The receiver failed to
recognize that the email address was not the actual email
address of DSM's CEO, resulting in funds being wired from
DSM.
At DSM Nutritional Products a man-in-the-middle attack of a
suppliers' email account resulted in a money transfer by DSM
to the wrong bank account.
With the increased incidence of cyber attacks, DSM
recognized the need to raise employee awareness as a strong
control measure. A DSM-wide Cyber Fraud Awareness e-
learning was launched.
At Group Business Services a monthly debit tax balance was
interpreted as a liability, resulting in erroneous payment to the
Dutch tax authorities. Immediately after discovery of the error,
mitigating measures were taken and the funds were fully
recovered.
At Group Business Services an attempt to transfer money from
the company to a fraudster's private bank account (instead of
that of a supplier) was timely detected and prevented by
carefully following the required procedures (no money was
transferred).
At Group Business Services a double payment was made due
to an incomplete set-up in the payment system. The money
was fully recovered.
At DSM Nutritional Products in Mexico, trucks carrying DSM
products were stolen on three occasions. In each of the cases
the truck driver was forced to stop on the highway, severely
threatened and had to hand over truck and cargo. Fortunately,
there were no personal injuries.What still went wrong in 2018
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  139 www.dsm.comShares and listings
Ordinary shares in Koninklijke DSM N.V. are listed on the
Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam (Netherlands) (Stock
code 00982, ISIN code NL0000009827). Options on ordinary
DSM shares are traded on the European Option Exchange in
Amsterdam (Euronext.liffe). In the US, a sponsored unlisted
American Depositary Receipts (ADR) program is offered by
Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas (DR ISIN US7802491081),
with four ADRs representing the value of one ordinary DSM
share.
Besides the ordinary shares, 44.04 million cumulative
preference shares A (cumprefs A) are in issue, which are not
listed on the stock exchange; these have been placed with
institutional investors. The cumprefs A have the same voting
rights as ordinary shares, as their nominal value of € 1.50 per
share is equal to the nominal value of the ordinary shares.
The dividend percentage of the cumprefs A is based upon the
dividend yield of the ordinary shares (dividend as a percentage
of the average share price). This percentage may be increased
or decreased by a markup or discount of no more than one
hundred (100) basis points, to be determined by the Managing
Board in consultation with the Supervisory Board. The basis
of computation of the dividend on the Preference Shares is
€ 5.2942.
Transfer of the cumprefs A requires the approval of the
Managing Board, unless the shareholder is obliged by law to
transfer his shares to a previous shareholder.
The average number of ordinary shares outstanding in 2018
was 175,322,889. All shares in issue are fully paid. On 31
December 2018, the company had 175,650,575 ordinary
shares outstanding.
Issue of shares
The issue of shares takes place by a decision of the Managing
Board. The decision is subject to the approval of the
Supervisory Board. The scope of this power of the Managing
Board shall be determined by a resolution of the General
Meeting of Shareholders and shall relate to at most all
unissued shares of the authorized capital, as applicable now
or at any time in the future. In the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders of 9 May 2018 this power was extended up to
and including 9 November 2019, on the understanding that
this authorization of the Managing Board is limited to a number
of ordinary shares with a nominal value amounting to 10% of
the issued capital at the time of issue, and to an additional 10%
of the issued capital at the time of issue if the issue takes place
within the context of a merger or acquisition within the scope
of DSM's strategy as published on the company website. The
issue price will be determined by the Managing Board andshall as much as possible be calculated on the basis of the
trading prices of ordinary shares on the Euronext Amsterdam
Stock Exchange.
Distribution of shares
Under the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act,
shareholdings of 3% or more in any Dutch company must be
disclosed to the Netherlands Authority for the Financial
Markets (AFM). According to the register kept by the AFM, the
following shareholders had disclosed that they have a direct
or indirect (potential) interest between 3% and 10% in DSM's
total share capital on 31 December 2018:
- ASR Nederland N.V.
- BlackRock, Inc.
- Capital Research and Management Company and Capital
Group International Inc.
- NN Group N.V.
- Rabobank Nederland Participatie B.V.
Repurchase of own shares
The company may acquire paid-up own shares by virtue of a
decision of the Managing Board, provided that the par value
of the acquired shares in its capital amounts to no more than
one tenth of the issued capital. Such a decision is subject to
the approval of the Supervisory Board. In the Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders of 9 May 2018, the Managing Board
was authorized to acquire own shares for a period of 18
months from said date (i.e. up to and including 9 November
2019), up to a maximum of 10% of the issued capital, provided
that the company will hold no more shares in stock than at
maximum 10% of the issued capital.
DSM repurchased a number of its own shares during 2018 for
the purpose of covering the company's commitments under
existing management and employee option plans, share (unit)
plans and stock dividend.
In 2018, DSM launched a first share buy back from 19 March
2018 for 1,600,000 shares for a total consideration of
€ 137 million. This program was destined to cover share-
based compensation plans (500,000 shares) and stock
dividend as part of the final dividend 2017 (1,100,000 shares).
DSM launched a second share buy back from 13 August 2018
for 1,100,000 shares for a total consideration of € 99 million.
This program was aimed at covering commitments under
share-based compensation plans (500,000 shares) and
commitments for stock dividend as part of the interim dividend
2018 (600,000 shares).
In 2018, DSM repurchased 2,700,000 of its own shares in total

Dividend on ordinary shares
DSM's dividend policy is to provide a stable and preferably
rising dividend. DSM proposes to increase the dividend to
€ 2.30 per ordinary share for 2018. This will be proposed to
the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on
8 May 2019. An interim dividend of € 0.77 ordinary share
having been paid in August 2018, the final dividend would then
amount to € 1.53 per ordinary share. The dividend will be
payable in cash or in the form of ordinary shares at the option
of the shareholder, with a maximum of 40% of the dividend
amount available for stock dividend. If more than 40% of thetotal dividend is requested by the shareholders to be paid out
in shares, those shareholders who have chosen to receive
their dividend in shares will receive their stock dividend on a
pro-rata basis, the remainder being paid out in cash. Dividend
in cash will be paid after deduction of 15% Dutch dividend
withholding tax. The ex-dividend date is 11 May 2019.
Dividend on Cumulative Preference Shares A
DSM will pay a dividend of €  0.17 per share for 2018, identical
to the dividend on the cumprefs A for 2016 and 2017. 
The dividend on the cumprefs A is based on the dividend yield
of the ordinary shares, being about 2.74% for 2018. The
Managing Board in consultation with the Supervisory Board
decided to use their discretionary option to increase this
percentage by about 52 bps to 3.26%. While the proposed
dividend for the ordinary shareholders will increase by about
25% versus 2017, the Managing Board felt it appropriate to
keep the dividend on the cumprefs A equal to 2017.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  144 www.dsm.comStakeholder engagement
In the following pages, we present some examples of how we
engage with external stakeholders, including the partners in
our value chain. For an overview of all our stakeholders, please
see 'Stakeholders' on page 34. For information on how we
engage with our employees, see 'People' on page 42.
Customers
Our Strategy 2021: Growth & Value - Purpose led,
Performance driven defines how we fulfil the current and future
needs of our customers and of their consumers. Our starting
point is our constantly evolving portfolio designed to serve our
evolving customers' needs and attuned to their values. The
launch of Maxilact® Smart illustrates the continuous
improvement mindset. The premium, lactose-free product
segment is growing fast, and this product supports our
customers' ambitions in this market. Maxilact® Smart enables
a significant increase in production efficiency and capacity at
our customers on top of an effective reduction of lactose.
Our portfolio reflects our purpose and supports our pioneering
customers. Our innovations contribute to Health, Nutrition and
Sustainable Living. Whether it is Niaga® to create a 100%
recyclable carpet, waterborne resins that have transformed
the container paint industry in China or the creation of the
Avansya partnership with Cargill for fermentative steviol
glycosides, all these innovations were founded on our
purpose-led philosophy and consumer needs.
Customer-centricity
Customer-centricity is the cornerstone of our growth ambition:
we strive to understand what drives value for our customers
and build multi-level relationships to strengthen customer
intimacy. To strengthen our customer relationships at strategic
accounts, we have implemented the Triple Fit methodology
developed by St. Gallen University's Account Management
Center across our business groups. This proven and effective
methodology aims to build and maintain high-value
relationships with our strategic accounts by identifying and
implementing joint value creation projects.
Co-development of solutions and offerings with our customers
is a growing area in nearly all the industries we serve. Our
partnership with Cooprata, a leading regional cooperative in
Brazil to produce solutions for beef cattle, combines local raw
materials with our vitamins. TruVitamins — a partnership in the
human nutrition market — utilizes the product formulation,
branding and marketing expertise of our Nutrition cluster with
our customer Happy Enzyme for this new vitamin supplement.
The value of the Quali® Brand on the product packaging is a
point of differentiation for the consumers in Korea. Increasingly
we complement our in-depth customer understanding with
consumer understanding to address the needs of the entire
value chain and enable incumbent and new players todifferentiate themselves by means of our extensive, high-
quality portfolio.
Our skilled professionals are continuously trained on what it
means to be customer-centric, enabling us to continue
bringing value to our customers. This was recognized through
the prestigious 2018 EFMD Excellence in Practice Gold Award
in the category 'Professional Development'.
Digitalization
Data are critical to understanding the customer and its
ecosystem. In 2018, the Data Analytics Center of Excellence
was introduced. The data analytics capabilities that are being
developed will help to accelerate the development,
industrialization and adoption of insights and data analytics
within DSM. Through this, we aim to create substantial and
additional impact, adding value to our businesses and
functions and gaining an ever better understanding of
customer/consumer behaviors and needs.
Next to data, digital technologies also help us to strengthen
our customer relationships, optimize customer touchpoints
and create customer delight. One such example is the
YiGouBao app developed for farmers in rural China. This app
allows farmers to order products from our distributors in an
easy way. It serves as a performance tracker for our
customers. Through this new way of interacting we can reach
an even larger group of farmers scattered across rural areas,
leading to improved penetration in the market and a higher
customer loyalty.
Customer loyalty
We measure customer loyalty through the Net Promoter Score
(NPS). In 2018, our NPS score reached 40 (2017: 39). NPS
allows us to measure customer satisfaction across the full
customer journey over a defined period. Additionally, we
measure NPS at key moments of the customer journey to
further optimize the process and enable improvements during
the journey.
Brand Value
Our brand is an important business asset. We are a purpose-
led, performance-driven company that aspires to provide
innovative products and solutions that support our purpose to
create brighter lives for all. In 2018, our brand value continued
its positive trajectory and reached €  844 million. Brand Finance
attributed the increase to improved growth forecasts.Sustainability statements

2018Suppliers
We engage with approximately 35,000 suppliers through our
Supplier Sustainability Program (SSP) to strengthen our supply
chain, reduce risk, lower cost and create value for society and
our company. Annual supplier sustainability plans and
sustainability roadmaps are used to gain insights. The Supplier
Sustainability Plan 2018 addressed a number of relevant
topics for the materiality matrix: 'Resource scarcity / Circular
economy', 'Responsible business practices' and 'Climate
change & renewable energy'.

Supplier Sustainability Program strategy
Our Supplier Sustainability Program is comprised of two
elements: Solutions and Compliance. Insights gathered in the
compliance program enabled us to very clearly define how we
choose to do business with our suppliers. We have invited
suppliers to contribute to our competitiveness in areas of
sustainability, innovation, business growth, security of supply,
new business models and strategic alliances. This occurs via
our 'Better Business' projects and other initiatives.Our assessment of the maturity level of our SSP was
conducted in 2016 and addressed four dimensions: Strategy/
Plan; Supply Risk & Opportunity; People, Infrastructure &
Measurements; and Processes. Those insights were used to
develop our sourcing strategy and position to meet the
ambition level for 2020.
Internal skills and capabilities
Internal capability-building regarding supplier sustainability
continued in 2018. We have shifted the focus from delivering
training toward providing hands-on support and promoting
peer learning. The peer learnings offer practical experience
and knowledge-sharing about integrating sustainability into
the daily work of sourcing professionals.
In Indirect Procurement, we initiated a strategy project to
increase our sustainability maturity. The strategy aims to move
from compliance through supplier selection toward impacting
the entire supply chain. The project includes an aligned and
approved strategy by the review board, and repetitive trainings
to raise sustainability awareness in the entire procurement
organization. The supplier selection consists of the sustainable
tender principle and risk management through Together for
Sustainability insights (TfS). The impact is driven by including
sustainability in our Key Supplier Management program and
by developing specific sustainability strategies for high-impact
categories.
Every year, the DSM Procurement community presents
awards to teams who have developed successful projects in
several categories, with sustainability a key topic in selecting
the winners. The Strategic Sourcing Methodology (SSM)
Award promotes strategic thinking, courage and creativity,
while the Best Supplier Innovation (BSI) Award recognizes a
successful collaboration with a supplier that brings value to
DSM.
Collaboration
We work with external partners to enhance collaboration in the
supply chain such as the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil
(RSPO) and TfS.
Our exposure to palm oil is very limited. DSM Nutritional
Products is a member of RSPO due to the potential risks to
the environment, human rights issues and labor practices in
the palm oil supply chain. DSM Food Specialties sources
RSPO 'Mass Balance' certified palm-derived glycerin in Asia.
Our objective is to use 100% RSPO-certified sustainable palm
oil and palm oil derivative products using RSPO
'Mass Balance' supply chain models by 2020. Going forward,
we aim to have all of the production sites that use palm oil or
palm oil derivative products RSPO-certified. For more
information on palm oil, see the company website.
We have 'Friends of the Sea' certification for all of our fish oil
purchases. This helps ensure that the fisheries involved in
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  146 www.dsm.comproviding fish oil for the production of our omega-3 product
range are sustainable.
We held our inaugural Supplier Partnership Day in the
Netherlands, which was attended by 75 key strategic
suppliers. This event aimed at strengthening key partnerships
and making our partners aware of our company's strategy to
drive further progress in sustainability through reducing our
environmental footprint while making a positive social impact.
We value our strategic supplier partnerships in delivering
tangible benefits in the areas of performance, innovation and
sustainability. As part of the event, we showcased the specificcontributions of excellent suppliers in different areas through
our Supplier Awards.
Compliance
Our approach to compliance is defined in our Supplier Code
of Conduct (SCoC). Through assessments and audits, we
check that suppliers act in compliance with external and
internal norms and values. Where a risk or breach occurs, we
work with suppliers to define and execute an improvement
plan. If non-compliance still persists, we may choose to
terminate the relationship with the supplier. In 2018, 95% of
our spend was covered by the SCoC.

We focus on approximately 1,000 critical suppliers, defined as
those that provide critical components, are located in
potentially high-risk countries, supply a high volume of
products or services, are non-substitutable, or have the
potential to create shared value in areas of innovation and
sustainability.
Since 2015, we have been actively collaborating with TfS.
Founded in 2011, TfS now has 22 members and aims to
develop and implement a global audit program to assess and
improve sustainability practices within the chemical industry's
supply chain. TfS works with EcoVadis, a recognized provider
of CSR ratings, to implement the program. The EcoVadis
methodology is aligned with international standards and
supervised by a scientific committee. This collaboration gives
DSM access to supplier assessments and audits, which are
executed by other TfS members and shared on the TfS
platform. The EcoVadis assessment covers Environment,
Labor & Human Rights, Ethics and Sustainable Procurement.
The collective (potential) supply base of the TfS members has
been rated by 10,566 EcoVadis assessments and 1,526 TfS
audits. In 2018, an additional 1,491 sustainability assessments
were shared among TfS members and 358 new TfS audit
reports were received by the initiative. In 2018, the average
EcoVadis assessment score of suppliers that completed an
assessment at DSM's request was 49 (up 1 point on 2017).
The average of the supplier performance level indicates that
our suppliers are engaged with sustainability.In 2018, as a result of the new Strategy 2021, a new
procurement sustainability vision was developed which
includes a Procurement Sustainability roadmap that will guide
our efforts toward sustainability and will impact TfS
(re-)assessments in future years. This new roadmap will
support the improvement of our low-scoring suppliers'
sustainability performance by actively developing and
following up on corrective actions. It will mark the start of a
shift from quantity to quality of assessments, and more to
sustainability related improvements in DSM's supply chain.
Better business
While compliance remains the cornerstone for achieving a
sustainable supply base, procurement activities increasingly
focus on so-called 'better business'.
As part of our drive to foster better business through our
supplier solution projects, our procurement organization
engages in proactive dialogue with suppliers in order to move
the business agenda forward on topics such as climate
change, food and nutrition security, health, and the circular
economy. In this context, we pursue initiatives to create joint
value, awareness and engagement using similar drivers to
those in our Brighter Living Solutions methodology.
Via the CO 2 Emission Reduction Initiative, the Global Logistic
and Packaging team investigated suppliers' footprints in road
transportation, marine, packaging and air transportation to
explore opportunities for improvement. Our aim of achieving a
20% reduction per unit of measurement in emissions by the
end of 2020 compared to 2010 was reached by the end ofSustainability statements
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  147 www.dsm.com2017, the latest reporting period. This great achievement can
be attributed to the engagement in joint initiatives with
suppliers that led to environmental benefits in the value chain.
Projects such as leveraging operations by optimizing logistics
for glass fiber inbound logistics and utilizing non-dedicated
containers to increase transport flexibility resulted in significant
reduction in CO 2 emissions.
Through a collaboration between procurement, supplier and
site colleagues, DSM Nutritional Products' site in Kingstree
(Georgia, USA) achieved a raw material change that delivered
significant advantages. The site uses an imported non-GMO
dry dextrose raw material that is shipped in one-ton bags.
Through the project, a switch to a liquid solution was realized
that reduced material handling risks for the raw material. In
addition to safety and ergonomic improvements, a productivity
gain was realized thanks to the different biomass behavioral
characteristics during the drying process.
Investors
DSM values the essential role of its capital providers for the
success and prosperity of the company, allowing it to pursue
a long-term oriented, value-creating strategy. This should also
lead to a continuous increase of the company's valuation for
the benefit of its shareholders and provide a low risk profile for
its debt holders.
We ensure that accurate financial and relevant non-financial
information is communicated to the financial markets in a
transparent and simultaneous way. All information is made
easily accessible to the public via the company website. Next
to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, we also reach
out to the financial markets through events like the Capital
Markets Day, participation in investor conferences, and by
organizing roadshows. We also actively seek engagement
with financial advisors who cover DSM on behalf of their
financial market clients, such as brokers, credit rating
agencies, proxy advisors, shareholder representative
organizations, and ESG rating agencies.
We actively seek feedback from the financial markets, which
is discussed and assessed by the company's Managing
Board and Supervisory Board from time to time. We highly
value the insights gained through these engagements.
We engage with our investors and their representatives on
topics such as the SDGs, climate change, governance,
sustainability in supply chain management, natural and social
capital, and responsible taxation.
We introduced Strategy 2021: Growth & Value - Purpose led,
Performance driven  at our Capital Markets Day in London (UK)
in June 2018. We presented how we will capture growth
opportunities offered by global megatrends and the SDGs,
and the ambitious targets for profit growth and cashgeneration that are associated with this. The market was also
updated on how sustainable long-term organic growth will be
supported by our large innovation projects.
This has led to an increased interest from investors and
analysts with a strong Environment, Social and Governance
(ESG)/SDG mindset. These parties recognize our efforts to
pursue good financial returns together with acting with
purpose.
We actively participated in various impact investment initiatives
including De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) working group on
SDG Impact Measurement in 2018. We also participated in
dedicated ESG conferences for investors such as the SRI
conferences in The Hague (Netherlands) in March and in Paris
(France) in November.
Society
We engage with society at many levels. We collaborate with
renowned universities and research institutes and work with
NGOs and civil society to work on solutions for societal
challenges. We engage with governments and society to
advocate on important issues relating to the Paris Agreement
and the Sustainable Development Goals. Here we share some
examples of our collaborations with society.
Scientific research institutions
We are one of the founding partners of EIT FOOD, which is
one of the six European Knowledge and Innovation
Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation
and Technology (EIT). The aim of EIT FOOD is to transform the
food ecosystem. In 2018, together with our project partners
we completed the first EIT FOOD Innovation, 'My Yogurt' – a
project to tailor the health, sustainability and sensory attributes
of yogurt for the millennial and 60+ generations. We also
participated in the education project 'Tasty Macronutrients',
looking at the use of plant-based proteins in food.
We are a founding member of the world-class nanotechnology
center at MIT in Boston (Massachusetts, USA), which opened
in October 2018. MIT.nano is an advanced facility open to the
entire community of faculty, researchers, students and
industry and will accelerate the pace of research at MIT and
with its partners worldwide. We also sponsor collaborative
projects to accelerate the innovation process, decreasing the
time from the lab to the market.
In the Netherlands, our partnerships tend to be in the so-called
golden triangle of governments, universities and knowledge
institutions to jointly develop new markets and growth areas,
creating jobs and economic value for the Netherlands. The
successful growth of the Brightlands Chemelot Campus,
which has the Province of Limburg, Maastricht University and
DSM as its founding fathers, is an example of a successful
partnership and a shared ambition. This has enabled the
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  148 www.dsm.comLimburg region to become a magnet for top talent from the
Netherlands and abroad.
NGOs
In Brazil, we support Gastromotiva, a non-profit organization
that has reached more than 3,500 at-risk young people
through articulated education, professionalism and
gastronomy. We supply high nutritional value foods, improving
the quality of life of people through micronutrient
supplementation. In addition, DSM experts contribute by
sharing technical-scientific knowledge for the 'Super-
Gastromotive Food League' project, which aims to improve
child nutrition and prevent childhood obesity.
In Singapore, we partner with 45Rice, a social enterprise
dedicated to improving lives through nutrition. With the motto
"Fortifying every meal", 45Rice brings essential vitamins and
minerals to a bowl of rice.
Local communities
Our DSM Nutritional Products and Food Specialties site in
Xinghuo (Shanghai, China) organized with the community an
open day for residents to increase transparency and trust in
the site. The theme of the open day was 'creating a green life
together'. This initiative was welcomed by resident's leaders,
the Development Zone and the Environmental Protection
Bureau.
In Brazil, we support Enactus Brazil. Enactus is a network of
students, executive and academic leaders that provides a
platform for college students to create community
development projects that put people's skills and talents in
focus.
Governments
In Europe, DSM engages with governments at several levels.
This includes specific visits from Members of Parliament, as
well as speaking slots at multi-stakeholder events including the
European Commission (EU Circular Business Conference),
EEB, HollandBIO, the European Parliament and The European
Forum for Industrial Biotechnology and the Bioeconomy.Sustainability statements

An increasing global population and the impact
of climate change will put greater strain on our
ability to provide sufficient food that is also
nutritionally complete. In turn, food systems
place pressure on the environment. A transition
to sustainable food systems within planetary
boundaries is needed to secure the future
availability of food.Through our animal nutrition products, we

Careers & employment Management approach Relevant sections
Employees are one of the most important
stakeholder groups for a company, and careers
and employment are an important topic to
companies and their stakeholders. Employees
seek rewarding career opportunities and a
healthy work-life balance. They actively seek
companies, and engage with employers, that
share their values.We cannot achieve our purpose without our
employees. Our people & organization strategy
shapes our engagement with our employees.

(TCFD)
The Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures
(TCFD) recommendations are a set of voluntary, climate-
related financial disclosures for use by companies to provide
information to their stakeholders. In 2017, we were among the
first companies to commit to implementing, as fully as
practicable, these recommendations over the following three
years as outlined in the TCFD's implementation path. The
recommendations are structured around four themes —
Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and
Targets.
This Report includes various disclosures relevant for the TCFD
recommendations. To highlight this, for each TCFD theme
reference is made to relevant sections.
Governance
IAR Disclosures
Sustainability, including climate risks & opportunities, is a
direct responsibility of the Managing Board. Sustainability is an
integral part of how we do business. It is a key responsibility,
our company's core value, and a business growth driver. Our
CFO is responsible for the implementation of the TCFD
recommendations and has appointed a taskforce for this.
Sustainability Governance Framework.   Defines in more
detail how Sustainability, including climate-related topics, is
governed within our company. Our external Sustainability
Advisory Board acts as sparring partner to the Managing
Board and senior executives.
Supervisory Board — Committees.  The Sustainability
Committee prepares the Supervisory Board's discussions on
sustainability topics, including our low-carbon future,
improving our climate impact, and reducing our climate risk
exposure.
Strategy
IAR Disclosures
It is our strategy to grow our business by offering innovative
sustainable solutions, some of which can clearly help to deal
with climate risks.
Strategy 2021.   Through our approach to sustainability based
on Improve , Enable  and Advocate  we de-risk our own
operations and we capture growth opportunities via our
products and innovations. Products in our focus area Climate
& Energy enable our customers to deliver solutions to deal with
the impact of climate risks. A Risk Assessment was performed
on Strategy 2021 including Climate Risks.
Planet.  The sections on Climate change & renewable energy
and Water security outline how we adapt to and mitigateclimate change in our own operations. We apply an internal
carbon price of € 50/t CO 2eq in our investment proposals.
Review of business.  Our portfolio of Health, Nutrition and
Sustainable Living products addresses our focus domains. In
Innovation, our big-ticket innovations derive from
opportunities we have identified in those domains.
Future considerations
Scenario analysis.  We are still defining our approach toward
resilience and scenario analysis. We have joined the WBCSD
Preparer Forum for the Chemical sector and scenario analysis
will be one of the main items to jointly work on.
Time horizons.  We have defined our time horizons, via our
CDP disclosure, but these are not yet integrated, together with
the accompanying issues, in our Annual Report.
Risk Management
IAR Disclosures
Risk Management.  Climate risks are integrated in our normal
risk management processes and also monitored as such in
the Managing Board. Additional focus has been placed on
climate related risks during our bottom-up 'Letter of
Representation' process to sensitize the organization to long
term climate risks. Climate risk is again identified in our
Corporate Risk Assessment as an emerging risk with both
transitional and physical aspects.
Other considerations
Risk Management.  Quantification and monetization of long-
term climate-related risks needs to be addressed.
Metrics and Targets
IAR Disclosures
Strategy 2021.  Our Scope 1 + 2 target is based on a below
2°C scenario and is supported by a range of measures
including our energy efficiency improvement and renewable
electricity targets.
Planet.  We disclose our Scope 1 + 2 and Scope 3 emissions,
and risks and opportunities relating to them. We apply an
internal carbon price of € 50/t CO 2eq in our large investment
proposals. We also report on avoided emissions, water,
waste, and other emissions.
Remuneration policy of the Managing Board.  Climate-
related metrics are part of the Short-Term and Long-Term
Incentives of the Managing Board.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  157 www.dsm.comSummary of significant accounting
policies
Basis of preparation
DSM's consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and the
provisions of section 362-8 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
The accounting policies applied by DSM comply with IFRS and
the pronouncements of the International Financial Reporting
Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) effective at 31 December
2018.
Effect of new accounting standards adopted in 2018
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and
IFRIC have issued IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, which became
effective as of 1 January 2018. DSM's accounting policies
were updated to reflect the changes driven by the
implementation of these standards. For completeness, a
summary of the impact on the accounting policies is provided
below as well.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments'
IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement'. For DSM this mainly impacted the
classification and measurement of its other participating
interests (OPI) reported under Other financial assets, which
under IAS 39 were accounted for as available for sale
securities measured at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognized in Other comprehensive income (OCI) or at cost.
Under IFRS 9, these OPIs will be measured at Fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL). However, in certain cases DSM
will use the irrevocable election to classify an OPI at Fair value
through OCI (FVOCI). The impact of this re-measurement was
not material. The table below summarizes the impact of IFRS
9 on the measurement of the OPIs. The difference in the
carrying amount is recognized in retained earnings at 1
January 2018.
 Original
classification
under IAS 39New
classification
under IFRS 9
Financial assets   
Other financial assets – OPI Available for sale
Fair value / At costFVTPL/FVOCI
Carrying amount 89 90
Another impact of the implementation of IFRS 9 was the
introduction of a new model for impairment, the Expected
credit loss (ECL) model. For DSM, this model resulted in the
recognition of a small and therefore insignificant default credit
loss risk for loans to, and guarantees for, third parties and
associated parties. For trade receivables, the transition to thenew loss model did not have a significant impact on the
valuation.
With regard to hedge accounting, DSM has elected to apply
as of 1 January 2018 the new hedge requirements from IFRS
9 instead of the old requirements from IAS 39. This has no
direct reportable impact on DSM's hedge practices. However,
it ensures that the company's hedge accounting relationships
are aligned with its risk management objectives and strategy,
and it provides a more qualitative and forward-looking
approach to assessing hedge effectiveness.
DSM has applied IFRS 9 retrospectively from 1 January 2018
and used the option not to restate comparative information for
prior periods.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers'
IFRS 15 provides a framework for revenue recognition
replacing old standards like IAS 11 ‘Accounting for
Construction Contracts' and IAS 18 ‘Revenue'. DSM has
adopted IFRS 15 as of 1 January 2018 using the cumulative
effect method, where the impact of adoption should be
recognized in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018, and the
comparatives will not be restated. The effect of applying IFRS
15, however, was immaterial and did not have a significant
impact on revenue recognition compared to the old revenue
recognition policies.
Effect of forthcoming accounting standards not yet applied
IFRS 16 is forthcoming but is not yet being applied by DSM.
It will be adopted on the required effective date of 1 January
2019.
IFRS 16 'Leases'
IFRS 16 establishes a new model for lessee accounting that
requires a lessee to recognize right-of-use assets and lease
liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases.
Additionally, the nature of expenses related to leases will
change, as IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line operating lease
expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and
interest expense on lease liabilities. Furthermore, the
classification of cash flows will also be affected, as operating
lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash
flows, whereas under the IFRS 16 model, the lease payments
will be split into a principal and an interest portion which will
both be presented as financing cash flows. The new standard
is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2019.
During 2018, DSM finalized its impact assessment of IFRS 16
on its consolidated financial statements. The standard will
primarily affect the accounting for DSM's operating leases.
The impact assessment performed indicates that the majority
of these arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under
IFRS 16, and hence DSM will recognize a lease liability and aConsolidated financial statements
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  158 www.dsm.comcorresponding right-of-use asset in respect of these leases.
Based on the impact assessment of IFRS 16, DSM expects
that the recognition of the leases will result in an impact of
around € 208 million on the balance sheet and will result in a
reclassification in the profit and loss from operating expenses
to depreciation/amortization and financial expenses of around
€ 45 million. It should be noted that these are management
estimates based on assumptions and contract data gathered
up to and including 2018.
The actual impact of applying IFRS 16 on the financial
statements in the period of initial application will depend on
future economic conditions, including DSM's borrowing rate
in 2019, the composition of DSM's lease portfolio at that date,
DSM's latest assessment of whether it will exercise any lease
renewal options, and the extent to which DSM chooses to use
practical expedients and recognition exemptions, as well as
the transition approach.
DSM plans to apply the modified retrospective transition
approach under which the right-of-use asset is measured at
an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted for any
prepayments or accruals.
New IFRIC interpretations are not expected to have a material
effect on the financial statements of DSM.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial
statements of Royal DSM and its subsidiaries (together 'DSM'
or 'group'). As a parent company, DSM is exposed, or has
right to, the variable returns from its involvement with its
subsidiaries and has the ability to affect the returns through its
power over the subsidiary. The financial data of subsidiaries
are fully consolidated. Non-controlling interests in the group's
equity and profit and loss are stated separately. A joint
arrangement is an entity in which DSM holds an interest and
which is jointly controlled by DSM and one or more other
venturers under a contractual arrangement. A joint
arrangement can either be a joint venture where DSM and the
other partner(s) have rights to the net assets of the
arrangement or a joint operation where DSM and the
partner(s) have rights to the assets, and obligations for the
liabilities to the arrangement. For joint ventures the investment
in the net assets is recognized and accounted for in
accordance with the equity method. For a joint operation,
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recognized in the
financial statements of DSM in accordance with the
contractual entitlement or obligations of DSM.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the acquisition date until
the date on which DSM ceases to have control. From the
acquisition date onwards, all intra-group balances and
transactions and unrealized profits or losses from intra-group
transactions are eliminated, with one exception: unrealized
losses are not eliminated if there is evidence of an impairmentof the asset transferred. In such cases an impairment of the
asset is recognized.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as
the aggregate of the consideration transferred, including
liabilities incurred, measured at acquisition date fair value, and
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed. 
As of the acquisition date, identifiable assets acquired,
liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree are recognized separately from goodwill. Identifiable
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are measured at
acquisition date fair value. For each business combination,
DSM elects whether it measures the non-controlling interest
in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the
acquiree's identifiable net assets. Any contingent
consideration payable is measured at fair value at the
acquisition date.
Segmentation
Segment information is presented in respect of the group's
operating segments about which separate financial
information is available that is regularly evaluated by the chief
operating decision maker. DSM has determined that Nutrition,
Materials and the Innovation Center represent reportable
segments in addition to Corporate Activities. The Managing
Board decides how to allocate resources and assesses the
performance of the clusters. Cluster performance is reported
and reviewed down to the level of Adjusted EBITDA. The
clusters are organized in accordance with the type of products
produced and the nature of the markets served. The same
accounting policies that are applied for the consolidated
financial statements of DSM are also applied for the operating
segments. Prices for transactions between segments are
determined on an arm's length basis. Segment results, assets
and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment
as well as those that can reasonably and consistently be
allocated. Selected information on a country and regional
basis is provided in addition to the information about operating
segments.
Foreign currency translation
The presentation currency of the group is the euro.
Each entity of the group records transactions and balance
sheet items in its functional currency. Transactions
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency
are recorded at the spot exchange rates prevailing at the date
of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency
of the entity are translated at the closing rates. Exchange
differences resulting from the settlement of these transactionsConsolidated financial statements — Summary of significant accounting policies
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  159 www.dsm.comand from the translation of monetary items are recognized in
the income statement.
Non-monetary assets that are measured on the basis of
historical costs denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency continue to be translated against the rate
at initial recognition and will not result in exchange differences.
On consolidation, the balance sheets of subsidiaries that do
not have the euro as their functional currency are translated
into euros at the closing rate. The income statements of these
entities are translated into euros at the average rates for the
relevant period. Goodwill paid on acquisition is recorded in the
functional currency of the acquired entity. Exchange
differences arising from the translation of the net investment in
entities with a functional currency other than the euro are
recorded in Other comprehensive income. The same applies
to exchange differences arising from borrowings and other
financial instruments in so far as those instruments hedge the
currency risk related to the net investment. On disposal of an
entity with a functional currency other than the euro, the
cumulative exchange differences relating to the translation of
the net investment are recognized in profit or loss.
Distinction between current and non-current
An asset (liability) is classified as current when it is expected
to be realized (settled) within 12 months after the balance
sheet date.
Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net
amount is presented in the balance sheet when DSM has a
legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle
them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.
Intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition
over DSM's share in the net fair value of the identifiable assets
and liabilities of an acquired subsidiary, joint venture or
associate. Goodwill paid on acquisition of subsidiaries is
included in intangible assets. Goodwill paid on acquisition of
joint ventures or associates is included in the carrying amount
of these entities. Goodwill recognized as an intangible asset is
not amortized but tested for impairment annually and when
there are indications that the carrying amount may exceed the
recoverable amount. A gain or loss on the disposal of an entity
includes the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity
sold.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are
recognized at fair value on the date of acquisition and
subsequently amortized over their expected useful lives, which
vary from 4 to 20 years.Separately acquired licenses, patents, drawing rights and
application software are carried at historical cost less straight-
line amortization and less any impairment losses. The
expected useful lives vary from 4 to 15 years. Costs of
software maintenance are expensed when incurred. Capital
expenditure that is directly related to the development of
application software is recognized as an intangible asset and
amortized over its estimated useful life (5 to 8 years).
Research costs are expensed when incurred. Development
expenditure is capitalized if the recognition criteria are met and
if it is demonstrated that it is technically feasible to complete
the asset; that the entity intends to complete the asset; that
the entity is able to sell the asset; that the asset is capable of
generating future economic benefits; that adequate resources
are available to complete the asset; and that the expenditure
attributable to the asset can be reliably measured.
Development expenditure is amortized over the asset's useful
life. Development projects under construction are included
under 'Development projects'.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less
depreciation calculated on a straight-line basis and less any
impairment losses. Interest during construction is capitalized
when it meets the criteria of a qualifying asset. Expenditures
relating to major scheduled turnarounds are capitalized and
depreciated over the period up to the next turnaround.
Property, plant and equipment are systematically depreciated
over their estimated useful lives. The estimated remaining lives
of assets are reviewed every year, taking account of
commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal
wear and tear. The initially assumed expected useful lives are
in principle as follows: for buildings 10–50 years; for plant and
machinery 5–15 years; for other equipment 4–10 years. Land
is not depreciated.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected to arise from the continued use or the sale of the
asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is
recorded in profit or loss.
Leases
Finance leases, which transfer to the group substantially all the
risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item,
are capitalized at inception of the lease at the fair value of the
leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum lease payments. All other leases are operating
leases.
Lease payments for finance leases are apportioned to finance
charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
liability. Finance charges are included in interest costs.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  160 www.dsm.comCapitalized leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of
the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense over
the lease term.
Associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which DSM has significant
influence but no control or joint control, usually evidenced by
a shareholding that entitles DSM to between 20% and 50% of
the voting rights. A joint venture is an entity where DSM has
joint control and is entitled to its share of the net assets and
liabilities. Investments in associates and joint ventures are
accounted for by the equity method, which involves
recognition in the income statement of DSM's share of the
associate's or joint venture's profit or loss for the year
determined in accordance with the accounting policies of
DSM. Any other results at DSM in relation to associated
companies are recognized under Other results related to
associates and joint ventures. DSM's interest in an associate
or joint venture is carried in the balance sheet at its share in
the net assets of the associate or joint venture together with
goodwill paid on acquisition, less any impairment loss.
When DSM's share in the loss of an associate or joint venture
exceeds the carrying amount of that entity, the carrying
amount is reduced to zero. No further losses are recognized,
unless DSM has responsibility for obligations relating to the
entity.
Non-derivative financial instruments
DSM initially recognizes loans and receivables and debt
securities on the date when they are originated. All other
financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized
on the date when DSM becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument. DSM derecognizes a financial
asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
asset expire, or when it transfers the rights to receive the
contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are
transferred, or when DSM neither transfers nor retains
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and
does not retain control over the transferred asset. DSM
derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual
obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.
Other financial assets
Other financial assets comprise loans to associates and joint
ventures, other participating interests, other receivables and
other deferred items.
DSM's business model objective for loans is to hold-to-collect
contractual cash flows only. Loans and long-term receivables
for which the contractual cash flows consist solely of principal
and interest are measured at amortized cost, using the
effective interest method, which generally corresponds to
nominal value, less an adjustment for expected credit loss. Theproceeds from these assets and the gain or loss upon their
disposal are recognized in profit or loss.
Other receivables, for which the contractual cash flows are not
solely principal and interest, are recognized at fair value, with
changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.
Other participating interests comprise equity interests in
entities in which DSM has no significant influence; these are
accounted for as assets at fair value through profit or loss. With
the adoption of IFRS 9 in 2018, DSM has opted for the existing
other participating interests to apply the irrevocable election to
present fair value changes in other comprehensive income
(Fair value reserve) instead of profit or loss. These changes will
not be recycled through profit and loss upon disposal of the
asset. Dividends received will be presented in profit or loss.
Impairment of assets
When there are indications that the carrying amount of a non-
current asset (an intangible asset or an item of property, plant
and equipment) may exceed the estimated recoverable
amount (the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs
to sell), the possible existence of an impairment loss is
investigated. If an asset does not generate largely independent
cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash
generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. In assessing
the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market interest rates and the risks specific
to the asset.
When the recoverable amount of a non-current asset is less
than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is impaired to
its recoverable amount and an impairment charge is
recognized in profit or loss. An impairment loss is reversed
when there has been a change in estimate that is relevant for
the determination of the asset's recoverable amount since the
last impairment loss was recognized. Impairment losses for
goodwill are never reversed.
Expected credit loss
All financial assets measured at amortized cost are reviewed
for expected credit loss as of initial recognition of the asset.
Credit losses are measured as the present value of the
difference between the cash flows due to DSM, and the cash
flows that DSM expects to receive. Expected credit losses are
recognized in the income statement. Loss allowances for trade
receivables are always measured at lifetime expected credit
loss.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable
value. The first in, first out (FIFO) method of valuation is used
unless the nature of the inventories requires the use of a
different cost formula, in which case the weighted average
cost method is used. The cost of intermediates and finishedConsolidated financial statements — Summary of significant accounting policies
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  161 www.dsm.comgoods includes directly attributable costs and related
production overhead expenses. Net realizable value is
determined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business, less the estimated costs of completion
and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Products
whose manufacturing cost cannot be calculated because of
joint cost components are stated at net realizable value after
deduction of a margin for selling and distribution efforts.
Current receivables
Current receivables for which the contractual cash flows are
solely principal and interest are initially recognized at fair value
plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to
initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using
the effective interest method, which generally corresponds to
nominal value, less an adjustment for expected credit loss.
Current investments
Current investments are initially recognized at fair value plus
any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to
initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using
the effective interest method. Deposits with banks with a
maturity between 3 and 12 months are classified as current
investments.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and in
hand and deposits held at call with banks with a maturity of
less than three months at inception. Bank overdrafts are
included in current liabilities. Included in cash and cash
equivalents are investments in money market funds that do
not meet the SPPI criterion but are held to meet short-term
cash demand. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at fair
value through profit and loss, or amortized cost.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups (assets and liabilities
relating to an activity that is to be sold) are classified as 'held
for sale' if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally
through a sales transaction rather than through continuing
use. The reclassification takes place when the assets are
available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable.
These conditions are usually met as from the date on which a
letter of intent or agreement to sell is ready for signing. Non-
current assets held for sale and disposal groups are measured
at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated or
amortized. For transparency, non-current assets and disposal
groups that will contribute to joint ventures are reported
separately from other assets and liabilities held for sale.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations comprise those activities that were
disposed of during the period or which were classified as held
for sale at the end of the period, and represent a separatemajor line of business or geographical area that can be clearly
distinguished for operational and financial reporting purposes.
Royal DSM Shareholders' equity
DSM's ordinary shares and cumulative preference shares are
classified as Royal DSM Shareholders' equity. This is the case
for the latter, as there is no mandatory redemption, and
distributions to the shareholders are at the discretion of DSM.
The price paid for repurchased DSM shares (treasury shares)
is deducted from Royal DSM Shareholders' equity until the
shares are cancelled or reissued. Treasury shares are
presented in the treasury share reserve. When treasury shares
are sold or reissued, the amount received is recognized as an
increase in equity, and the result on the transaction is
presented as share premium. Dividend to be distributed to
holders of cumulative preference shares is recognized as a
liability when the Supervisory Board approves the proposal for
profit distribution. Dividend to be distributed to holders of
ordinary shares is recognized as a liability when the Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders approves the profit
appropriation.
Provisions
Provisions are recognized when all of the following conditions
are met (1) there is a present legal or constructive obligation
as a result of past events, (2) it is probable that a transfer of
economic benefits will settle the obligation, and (3) a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The probable amount required to settle long-term obligations
is discounted if the effect of discounting is material. Where
discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the
passage of time is recognized as interest costs.
Borrowings
Borrowings are not held for trading and are initially recognized
at fair value of the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Subsequently, borrowings are stated at amortized cost using
the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated
taking into account any discount or premium. Interest
expenses are recorded in profit or loss.
Where the interest rate risk relating to a long-term borrowing
is hedged through a fair value hedge, and the hedge is
effective, the carrying amount of the long-term loan is adjusted
for changes in fair value of the interest component of the
hedged loan.
Other current liabilities
Other current liabilities are measured at amortized cost, which
generally corresponds to the nominal value.
Financial derivatives
Financial derivatives are recognized on the day of trading at
fair value, with changes recognized in profit and loss.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  162 www.dsm.comRevenue for contracts with customers
Revenues from contracts with customers are recognized by
identifying the contract and its performance obligations as well
as determination and allocation of the transaction price to
these performance obligations. At DSM, revenue related to the
sale of goods is recognized in the income statement when the
performance obligation, which is at the point in time when
transfer of control of the goods passes to the buyer, is
satisfied. This revenue is measured at the fair value of the
transaction price received.
Income coming from the rendering of services is recognized
when the service, i.e. the performance obligation, has been
performed. The revenue is measured at the fair value of the
transaction price received.
Net sales represent the invoice value less estimated rebates
and cash discounts, and excluding indirect taxes.
Income relating to the sale or licensing of technologies or
technological expertise is recognized in the income statement
at a point in time when the contractually identified performance
obligations are satisfied, such as transfer of the rights and
obligations associated with those technologies. This income
is reported in Net sales when the income is part of the ordinary
and recurring activities of the business and, if not, in Other
operating income. Interest income is recognized on a time-
proportionate basis using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive
payment is established.
Government grants
Government grants are recognized at their fair value if there is
reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all
related conditions will be complied with. Cost grants are
recognized as income over the periods necessary to match
the grant on a systematic basis to the cost that it is intended
to compensate. If the grant is an investment grant, its fair value
is initially recognized as deferred income in Other non-current
liabilities and then released to profit or loss over the expected
useful life of the relevant asset.
Share-based compensation
The costs of option plans are measured by reference to the
fair value of the options on the date on which the options are
granted. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes
model, taking into account market conditions linked to the
price of the DSM share. The costs of these options are
recognized in profit or loss (Employee benefit costs) during the
vesting period, together with a corresponding increase in
Equity in the case of equity-settled options or Other non-
current liabilities in the case of cash-settled options (Share
Appreciation Rights). No expense is recognized for options
that do not ultimately vest, except for options where vesting is
conditional upon a market condition, which are treated asvesting, irrespective of whether or not the market condition is
satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are
met.
Performance shares and restricted share units are granted free
of charge and vest after three years on the achievement of
previously determined targets. The cost of performance
shares and restricted share units is measured by reference to
the fair value of the DSM shares on the date on which the
performance shares and restricted share units were granted
and is recognized in profit or loss (Employee benefit costs)
during the vesting period, together with a corresponding
increase in equity.
Emission rights
DSM is subject to legislation encouraging reductions in
greenhouse gas emissions and has been awarded emission
rights (principally CO 2 emission rights) in a number of
jurisdictions. Emission rights are reserved for meeting delivery
obligations and are recognized at cost (usually zero). Revenue
is recognized when surplus emission rights are sold to third
parties. When actual emissions exceed the emission rights
available to DSM, a liability is recognized for the expected
additional costs.
Alternative performance measures (APMs)
DSM uses Alternative performance measures to present and
discuss DSM's financial results. To arrive at these APMs,
adjustments are made to material items of income and
expense arising from circumstances such as Acquisitions/
divestments, Restructuring, Impairments and Other.
'Other' APM adjustments include site closure costs,
environmental cleaning, litigation settlements or other non-
operational (contractual) arrangements. Other than items
related to acquisition and integration costs incurred in the first
year from the acquisition date (including non-recurring
inventory value adjustments) as well as adjustments due to
previously recognized APM adjusting events, the threshold is
€ 10 million.
Income tax
Income tax expense is recognized in the income statement
except to the extent that it relates to an item recognized
directly in Other comprehensive income or Shareholders'
equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the
taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable with
respect to previous years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the expected tax consequences of
temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets
and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured at the tax rates that have been enacted
or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date. They areConsolidated financial statements — Summary of significant accounting policies
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  163 www.dsm.comexpected to apply when the related deferred tax assets are
realized or the deferred tax liabilities are settled. Deferred tax
assets, including assets arising from losses carried forward
and tax credits, are recognized to the extent that it is probable
that future taxable profits will be available against which the
deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses can
be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are stated at
nominal value.
Deferred taxes are not provided for the following temporary
differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial
recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting
nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in
subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in
the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities are offset and presented net when there is a legally
enforceable right to offset, and the assets and liabilities relate
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are contractually agreed rights and
obligations resulting in an inflow or outflow of financial assets
or the issue of equity instruments. They are initially measured
at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Transaction costs for financial instruments assigned to the
category at fair value through profit and loss are recognized
directly in the income statement. Subsequent measurement is
based on the classification of financial instruments defined in
IFRS 9.
Financial derivatives and hedging
The group uses financial derivatives such as foreign currency
forward contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge risks
associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Financial derivatives are initially recognized in the balance
sheet at fair value. Subsequently, financial derivatives, bank
balances and deposits in foreign currency are valued against
the rates applicable on the balance sheet closing date.
Changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss unless
cash flow hedge accounting or net investment hedge
accounting is applied. For the measurement basis, see page
205.
Changes in the fair value of financial derivatives designated
and qualifying as cash flow hedges are recognized in Other
comprehensive income (Hedging reserve) to the extent that
the hedge is effective. Upon recognition of the related asset or
liability, the cumulative gain or loss is transferred from the
hedging reserve and included in the carrying amount of the
hedged item if it is a non-financial asset or liability. Any
ineffective portion of the changes of the fair value of the
derivative is recognized immediately in profit and loss. If the
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the hedge
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the
designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinuedprospectively. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected
to occur, then the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified
to profit or loss. If the hedged item is a financial asset or liability,
the gain or loss is transferred to profit or loss. Changes in the
fair value of financial derivatives designated and qualifying as
net investment hedges are recognized in Other
comprehensive income (Translation reserve) to the extent that
the hedge is effective and the change in fair value is caused
by changes in currency exchange rates. Accumulated gains
and losses are released from Other comprehensive income
and are included in profit or loss when the net investment is
disposed of. Changes in the fair value of financial derivatives
designated and qualifying as fair value hedges are immediately
recognized in the income statement, together with any
changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities
attributable to the hedged risk.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
DSM has both defined contribution plans and defined benefit
plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, obligations are
limited to the payment of contributions, which are recognized
as Employee benefit costs. In the case of defined benefit plans,
the aggregate of the value of the defined benefit obligation and
the fair value of plan assets for each plan is recognized as a
net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit obligations
are determined using the projected unit credit method. Plan
assets are recognized at fair value. If the fair value of plan
assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit
obligation, a net asset is only recognized to the extent that the
asset is available for refunds to the employer or for reductions
in future contributions to the plan. Defined benefit pension
costs consist of three elements: service costs, net interest,
and remeasurements. Service costs are part of Employee
benefit costs and consist of current service costs. Past service
costs and results of plan settlements are included in Other
operating income or expense. Net interest is part of Financial
income and expense and is determined on the basis of the
value of the net defined benefit asset or liability at the start of
the year, and on the interest on high-quality  corporate bonds.
Remeasurements are actuarial gains and losses, the return (or
interest cost) on net plan assets (or liabilities) excluding
amounts included in net interest and changes in the effect of
the asset ceiling. These remeasurements are recognized in
Other comprehensive income as they occur and are not
recycled through profit or loss at a later stage.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  170 www.dsm.comNotes to the consolidated financial statements of Royal DSM
1 General information
Unless stated otherwise, all amounts are in € million.
A list of DSM participations has been filed with the Chamber of Commerce (Netherlands) and is available from the company upon
request. The list can also be downloaded from the company website.
The preparation of financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The
policies that management considers to be the most important to the presentation of the financial condition and results of operations
are discussed in the relevant Notes. The same holds for the issues that require management judgments or estimates about matters
that are inherently uncertain. Management cautions that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely require
adjustment. Areas of judgment that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements relate
to the categorization of certain items as 'APM adjustments' relating to the alternative performance measures, the identification of
cash generating units (CGUs) and the classification of activities as 'held for sale' and 'discontinued operations'.
Key assumptions and estimates that need to be made by management relate to the useful lives of non-current assets (Notes 8
and 9), the establishment of provisions for restructuring costs, environmental costs (Note 18) and retirement and other post-
employment benefits (Note 24), the recognition and measurement of income taxes (Note 7) and the determination of fair values for
financial instruments (Note 23) and for share-based compensation (Note 27). The uncertainty concerning the actual outflows of
provisions relates to both the amounts and the timing of potential future events. Furthermore, impairment testing mainly of goodwill
and development projects requires judgments by management, among other things with respect to the determination of CGUs,
the estimation of future cashflows, growth rates and discount rates to apply (Notes 2, 8, 9 and 10). Significant judgment is also
required for the determination of earn-out receivables and payables in business combinations (Note 3) and for the valuation of
drawing rights (Note 8). For drawing rights, the most important judgments relate to the estimation of the required maintenance and
replacement outlays. Estimates are based on historical quoted market prices, experience and assumptions that are considered
reasonable under the circumstances.
Exchange rates
The currency exchange rates that were used in preparing the consolidated financial statements are listed below for the most
important currencies.

Presentation of consolidated income statement
DSM presents expenses in the consolidated income statement in accordance with their function. This allows the presentation of
gross margin on the face of the income statement, which is a widely used performance measure in the industry. The composition
of the costs allocated to the individual functions is explained below.
Cost of sales  encompasses all manufacturing costs (including raw materials, employee benefits, and depreciation and
amortization) related to goods and services captured in net sales. These are measured at their actual cost based on FIFO, or
weighted average cost.
Marketing and sales  relates to the selling and marketing of goods and services, and also includes all costs that are directly related
to the sale of goods, but are not originated by the manufacturing of the goods (e.g. freight).Consolidated financial statements — Notes to the consolidated financial statements of Royal DSM
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  171 www.dsm.comResearch and development  consists of:
- Research, which is defined as original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or
technical knowledge and understanding
-Development, which is defined as the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production
of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services before the start of commercial
production or use
General and administrative  relates to the strategic and governance role of the general management of the company as well as
the representation of DSM as a whole in the financial, political or business community. It also relates to business support activities
of staff departments that are not directly related to the other functional areas.
2 Alternative performance measures
In presenting and discussing DSM's financial position, operating results and net results, management uses certain Alternative
performance measures not defined by IFRS. These Alternative performance measures (APMs) should not be viewed in isolation as
alternatives to the equivalent IFRS measures and should be used as supplementary information in conjunction with the most directly
comparable IFRS measures. Alternative performance measures do not have standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may
not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
To provide clear reporting on the developments of the business, APM adjustments are made that impact the EBIT(DA), net profit,
ROCE and the EPS. A reconciliation of these Alternative performance measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures
can be found on page 174.
The APM adjustments to net profit, as included in the APMs, can be specified as follows:

Acquisitions
In 2018 DSM did not acquire any new businesses.
The PPAs for the 2017 acquisitions of Inner Mongolia Rainbow Biotechnology, Twilmij, BioCare Copenhagen and Amyris Brasil
were finalized in 2018. In accordance with IFRS 3, the purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
The PPA of Twilmij resulted in a reallocation of goodwill (-€ 31 million) to mainly other intangible assets for customer relations and
the brand name. The PPA of the BioCare Copenhagen acquisition led to a reallocation of goodwill (-€  21 million) to other intangible
assets for technology and customer relations. The finalization of the PPA of Amyris Brasil resulted in recognition of an additional
contingent consideration of € 50 million. This was reallocated to intangible assets for customer relations, IP and goodwill.
The impact of the acquisitions on DSM's consolidated balance sheet (measured at the date of acquisition) is shown in the following
table.Consolidated financial statements — Notes to the consolidated financial statements of Royal DSM

Disposals
There were no material disposals in 2018.
Other changes
On 1 January 2018, DSM deconsolidated the Yantai Andre
Pectin business, following developments in early January after
the refusal of the other shareholders to transfer their shares to
DSM despite an earlier agreement.
4 Segment information
DSM's operating segments are Nutrition, Materials and the
Innovation Center. DSM has segmented its operations by
business activity from which revenues are earned and
expenses incurred. These operating results are regularly
reviewed by the entity's chief operating decision maker
(CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to
the segment and assess its performance. DSM uses Adjusted
EBITDA as the main indicator to evaluate the consolidated
performance as well as the performance per segment.
Discrete financial information is available for each identified
segment. The accounting policies of the operating segments
are the same as those described in the Summary of significant
accounting policies. Transactions between segments are
generally executed at market-based prices. Interest income,
interest expense, and income tax expense or income are not
allocated to segments as these amounts are not included in
the measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by the CODM,
or otherwise regularly provided to the CODM.Nutrition serves the global industries for animal feed, food and
beverages, pharmaceuticals, infant nutrition, dietary
supplements, and personal care. It does so by the production
of pure active ingredients, their incorporation into
sophisticated forms, and the provision of tailored premixes
and forward solutions.
Materials is a global player in specialty plastics, which are used
in components for the electrical and electronics, automotive,
flexible food-packaging, and consumer goods industries.
Furthermore, Materials is a global player in providing
innovative, sustainable resins solutions for paints and industrial
and optical fiber coatings, as well as the fiber Dyneema®.
The Innovation Center focuses on innovation and growth of
DSM's existing core business through adjacent technologies
via its Corporate Research Program as well as through the
company's venturing and licensing activities. Additionally, it
identifies and invests in new and innovative growth options.
The Innovation Center is responsible for developing and
extracting value from DSM's Emerging Business Areas.
Any consolidated activities outside the three reported
segments are reported as 'Corporate Activities'. These mainly
comprise operating and service activities as well as a number
of costs that cannot be allocated to the clusters.
DSM does not have a single external customer that represents
10% or more of total sales.

The effective tax rate on the Adjusted taxable result was 17.4%
in 2018 (2017: 16.8%). The effective tax rate in 2017 was
positively impacted by the adjusted federal tax rate in the US.
The effective tax rate in 2018 was positively impacted by the
geographical spread. The relationship between the income tax
rate in the Netherlands and the effective tax rate on the result
is as follows:Consolidated financial statements — Notes to the consolidated financial statements of Royal DSM

been challenged, by the tax authorities, because the authorities in question interpret the law differently. These uncertainties are
taken into account in determining the probability of realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the following balance sheet items:

No deferred tax assets were recognized for loss carryforwards amounting to € 237 million  (2017: € 211 million ). Unrecognized loss
carryforwards amounting to € 58 million will expire in the years up to and including 2023 (2017: € 77 million up to and including
2022), € 112 million  between 2024 and 2028 (2017: € 72 million  between 2023 and 2027) and the remaining € 67 million between
2029 and beyond (2017: € 63 million between 2028 and 2032).
The valuation of deferred tax assets depends on the probability of the reversal of temporary differences and the utilization of tax
loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized for future tax benefits arising from temporary differences and for tax loss
carryforwards to the extent that the tax benefits are likely to be realized. In the Netherlands, tax losses may be carried forward for
six years. DSM has to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable profits. Deferred tax assets
are reduced if, and to the extent that, it is not probable that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In the
event that actual future results differ from estimates, and depending on tax strategies that DSM may be able to implement, changes
to the measurement of deferred taxes could be required, which could impact on the company's financial position and profit for the
year.Consolidated financial statements — Notes to the consolidated financial statements of Royal DSM

The amortization of intangible assets is included in Cost of sales, Marketing and sales, Research and development and General
and administrative expenses.
Over the past few years, DSM has acquired several entities in business combinations that have been accounted for by the
acquisition method, resulting in recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets. The amounts assigned to the acquired assets
and liabilities are based on assumptions and estimates about their fair values. In making these estimates, management consults
independent, qualified appraisers if appropriate. A change in assumptions and estimates could change the values allocated to
certain assets and their estimated useful lives, which could affect the amount or timing of charges to the income statement, such
as amortization of intangible assets.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  184 www.dsm.comThe deconsolidation relates to the Yantai Andre Pectin business. See also Note 3 'Change in the scope of the consolidation'. For
impairments, see Note 2 'Alternative performance measures'.

The annual impairment tests of goodwill are performed in the
fourth quarter. The recoverable amount of the Cash-
generating units (CGUs) concerned is based on a value-in-use
calculation. DSM Nutritional Products, DSM Resins &
Functional Materials and DSM Biomedical are the three CGUs
to which significant amounts of goodwill are allocated.
The cash flow projections are derived from DSM's business
plan (Corporate Strategy Dialogue) as adopted by the
Managing Board, updated on a yearly basis. Mature
businesses come to a terminal value after 5 years. The terminal
value growth rate is determined with the assumption of limited
inflationary growth. For emerging businesses, an explicitforecast period of 10 years is used with the same assumption
for growth in the terminal value. The key assumptions in the
cash flow projections relate to the market growth for the CGUs
and the related revenue projections, EBITDA developments,
and the rates used for discounting cash flows.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  185 www.dsm.comFor DSM Nutritional Products the growth assumptions are
based on the growth of the global food and feed markets, for
DSM Resins & Functional Materials on the demand for
advanced coating resins (influenced by growth in building and
construction markets) and for DSM Biomedical on the growth
of the market for medical devices.
A sensitivity test was performed on the impairment tests of the
CGUs and showed that the conclusions of these tests would
not have been different if reasonable possible adverse change
in key parameters had been assumed.
The market capitalization of DSM at 31 December 2018
amounted to € 12,961 million (31 December 2017: € 14,454million) and was clearly above the carrying amount of net
assets, thus providing an additional indication that goodwill
was not impaired.
Development costs
The carrying amount of development costs at 31 December
2018 included € 224 million (2017: € 156 million) mainly
relating to strategic projects which are not being amortized
yet. The recoverable amount of these CGUs was estimated
based on the present value of the future cash flows expected
to be derived from the CGUs (value-in-use). For one
development project, an impairment of € 18 million was
recorded. See also Note 2 'Alternative performance
measures'.

Other intangible assets include drawing rights contracts with
Fibrant. Fibrant will continue to supply at least 80% of DSM
Engineering Plastics' caprolactam needs in Europe and North
America for 15 years (2015–2030) via a drawing rights
contract, effectively maintaining DSM Engineering Plastics'
backward integration. Initially the fair value of this contract has
been recognized as an intangible asset by DSM Engineering
Plastics; for subsequent measurement, the initial fair value is
the deemed cost of the asset, which is subject to straight-line
amortization. At the end of 2018, it had a carrying amount of
€ 184 million (2017: €  198 million), a remaining useful life of 12years, and an amount of €  57 million was still payable to Fibrant
for the acquisition of the drawing rights (2017: € 72 million).
Other intangible assets also include the customer relationships
that were part of the Fortitech acquisition in 2012, with a
carrying amount at the end of 2018 of € 94 million (2017:
€ 99 million). Furthermore, acquisition-related intangibles are
included in the annual goodwill impairment test previously
discussed in this section. These intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis. There are no intangible
assets with an indefinite useful life (2017: € 46 million).

In 2018 the following events took place related to the
associates and joint arrangements:
In the reporting year, the legal structure of ChemicaInvest
changed. Chemicalnvest is owned 35% by DSM and 65% by
CVC Capital Partners. As a result of the restructuring and the
divestment of the caprolactam business of Fibrant by
ChemicaInvest, DSM now has a direct share in the acrylonitrile
business of AnQore (35%) and in the composite resins
business of AOC Aliancys (18.9%). ChemicaInvest sold its
share in the caprolactam business of Fibrant in the
Netherlands and China to Highsun. DSM anticipates receiving
about €  200 million in cash related to this transaction, of which
€ 120 million was received in 2018.
On 31 October 2018, DSM divested its share in DSM
Sinochem Pharmaceuticals (DSP). Bain Capital acquired DSP
from DSM and Sinochem Group, who each held an equity
stake of 50%. DSM received €  247 million for its equity stake,
excluding an earn-out (recognized at € 36 million) and
transaction costs, resulting in a book profit of €  109 million on
the transaction. DSM received € 271 million in cash following
closing, including repayment of debt and after transaction
costs.

Following the outcome of the court case in January 2018,
DSM deconsolidated Yantai Andre Pectin with effect from 1
January 2018. DSM's 28.95% stake in Yantai Andre Pectin is
now accounted for as a Share in an associate, initially at fair
value (€ 43 million). This deconsolidation has led to an
accounting profit of € 11 million.
On 4 October 2018, DSM Innovation Center sold its 22.8%
share in Essential Medical for a consideration of USD 14.7
million plus an estimated earn-out of USD 3 million. The book
result amounts to € 13 million.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  188 www.dsm.comJoint operations
In 2017, DSM and Evonik established Veramaris®, a joint operation for omega-3 fatty acid products from natural marine algae for
animal nutrition. DSM Nutritional Products and Evonik Nutrition & Care each hold a 50% share in the joint operation and will co-
own the production facility, which is currently being built in Blair (Nebraska, USA). The construction of the USD 200 million facility,
in which both joint operators will invest USD 100 million over two years, is progressing on time and according to plan. Commercial
quantities of algal oil are scheduled to be ready for delivery in mid-2019. Pilot-scale quantities are already being supplied to selected
feed producers and farmers for market development. The joint operation is headquartered in Delft (Netherlands). DSM accounts
for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to Veramaris® in accordance with IFRS 11 for joint operations.

Other participating interests relate to equity instruments in companies whose activities support DSM's business and which can be
quoted or unquoted. In view of the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as of January 2018, DSM revalued the Other
participating interests which were not yet recognized at fair value. The adoption of this standard has not resulted in a significant
impact on the financial information. See Note 23 'Financial instruments and risks' for the fair value hierarchy.
Repayments to the value of € 192 million relate to the settlement of various loans and the financing of ChemicaInvest. See also

Cash at year-end 2018 was not being used as collateral and
therefore was not restricted (same as in 2017).
In a few countries DSM faces cross-border foreign exchange
controls and/or other legal restrictions that limit its ability to
make these balances available on short notice for general use
by the group. The amount of cash held in these countries was
€ 104 million (2017: € 116 million). The cash will generally be
invested or held in the relevant country and, given the other
liquidity resources available to the group, does not significantly
affect the ability of the group to meet its cash obligations.
Cash held by DSM includes cash from certain associates and
joint ventures that continue to participate in the cash-pooling
arrangements of DSM. At the end of 2018, the amount had
decreased by € 14 million to € 5 million. See also Note 21

1Reclassification to retained earnings
The increase in the Translation reserve in 2018 is mainly caused by a weakening of the euro against the US dollar and Swiss franc,
partly offset by a strengthening against the Brazilian real. As a consequence, the value of the subsidiaries in those countries
increased, which led to a positive exchange difference of €  129 million. In addition, there was a €  14 million release of the cumulative
translation reserve of mainly DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals to the income statement.
The Translation reserve, Hedging reserve and the Fair value reserve are legal reserves in accordance with Dutch law and cannot
be distributed to shareholders. Additional information is provided in Note 7 to the 'Parent company financial statements'.Consolidated financial statements — Notes to the consolidated financial statements of Royal DSM

In cases where the effect of the time value of money is material,
provisions are measured at the present value of the
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
The discount rate used decreased from 1.9% to 1.8%. The
balance of provisions measured at present value increased by
€ 0.6 million in 2018 in view of the passage of time (2017:
increase of € 0.3 million).
The provisions for restructuring costs and termination benefits
mainly relate to the costs of redundancy schemes connected
to the dismissal of employees and costs of termination of
contracts. These provisions have an average life of 1 to 3
years.
The provisions for environmental costs relate to soil clean-up
obligations, among other things. These provisions have an
average life of around 10 years.The provisions for other long-term employee benefits mainly
relate to length-of-service and end-of-service payments. The
average life of this provision is estimated to be between 10 and
12 years.
Several items have been combined under Other provisions, for
example demolition costs, onerous contracts and legal risks.
These provisions have an average life of 1 to 3 years.
The additions to the provisions for restructuring costs and
termination benefits in 2018 mainly relate to the various
restructuring projects (same as in 2017).Consolidated financial statements — Notes to the consolidated financial statements of Royal DSM

party and if the company is downgraded below investment
grade (< BBB-). In July 2018, Moody's left the stable outlook
for their A3 credit rating for DSM unchanged. Standard &
Poor's confirmed DSM's credit rating in March 2018 to be A
with a stable outlook. At 31 December 2018, there was

Litigation
DSM has a process in place to monitor legal claims periodically
and systematically.
DSM is involved in several legal proceedings, most of which
are related to the ordinary course of business. DSM does not
expect these proceedings to result in liabilities that have a
material effect on the company's financial position. In cases
where it is probable that the outcome of the proceedings will
be unfavorable, and the financial outcome can be measuredreliably, a provision has been recognized in the financial
statements and disclosed in Note 18 'Provisions'.
In 2015, an award was issued against DSM Sinochem
Pharmaceuticals India Private Ltd. (DSP India) in a protracted
arbitration case in India going back to 2004 involving a joint
venture that DSP India had formed with Hindustan Antibiotics
Ltd., which suspended its operations in 2003. DSP India (after
divestment by DSM in 2018 renamed to Centrient
Pharmaceuticals) is covered by an indemnity from Koninklijke
DSM N.V. for this case. In 2015, DSP India made an
application with the Civil Court in Pune (India) to set aside the
arbitral award. The award amounts to approximately
€ 18 million  (excluding interest of 12% per year). At the end of
2018, the application proceedings were still pending. DSM has
always viewed this case as unfounded and is of the opinion
that the likelihood of the award being ultimately set aside is
high. Therefore no liability is recognized in respect of this case.
23 Financial instruments and risks
Policies on financial risks
General
As an international company, DSM is exposed to financial risks
in the normal course of business. A major objective of our
group policy is to minimize the impact of market, liquidity and
credit risk on the value of the company and its profitability. In
order to achieve this, a systematic financial and risk
management system has been established.
The financial derivatives contracts used by DSM are entered
into exclusively in connection with the corresponding
underlying transaction (hedged item) relating to normal
operating business, which provides a risk profile directly
opposite that of the hedge. The instruments used are
customary products found in the market, such as currency
swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, collars, forward
exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and commodity
swaps.
An important element of DSM's financial policy and capital
management is the allocation of cash flow. DSM primarily
allocates cash flow to investments aimed at strengthening its
business positions and securing the dividend payment to its
shareholders. The remaining cash flow is further used for
acquisitions and partnerships that strengthen DSM's
competences and market positions. This is discussed more
extensively in 'Financial and reporting policies' of the Report
by the Managing Board, see page 105. The net debt to equity
ratio (gearing) is 1.4 (see also Note 25).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the financial risk due to uncertain development
of liquidity. An entity may not get access to sufficient liquidity
if its credit rating falls, when it experiences sudden unexpected
cash outflows or an unexpected drop in cash inflows, or some
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  198 www.dsm.comother event causes counterparties to avoid trading with or
lending to the institution. A company is also exposed to
liquidity risk if financial markets on which it depends are subject
to loss of liquidity.
The primary objective of liquidity management is to optimize
the corporate cash position, among other things, by securing
availability of sufficient liquidity for execution of payments by
DSM entities, at the right time and the right place.
At December 2018, DSM had cash and cash equivalents of
€ 1,281 million (2017: € 899 million).
At the end of May 2018, DSM replaced two committed credit
facilities of €  500 million each with one committed credit facility
of € 1.0 billion, maturing on 29 May 2023. The agreement for
the committed credit facility has neither financial covenants nor
material adverse changes clauses. The committed credit
facility links the interest rate to DSM's Greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission reduction. At year-end 2018, no loans had been
taken up under the committed credit facility.Furthermore, DSM has a commercial paper program
amounting to € 1,500 million (2017: € 1,500 million). The
company will use the commercial paper program to a total of
not more than € 1,000 million (2017: € 1,000 million). 
At 31 December 2018, € 0 million had been issued as
commercial paper (2017: € 0 million). DSM has no derivative
contracts to manage currency risk or interest rate risk
outstanding under which margin calls by the counterparty
would be permitted.
Floating-rate and fixed-rate borrowings and monetary liabilities
analyzed by maturity are summarized in the following table.
Borrowings excluding credit institutions are shown after taking
into account related interest rate derivatives in designated
hedging relationships. DSM manages financial liabilities and
related derivative contracts on the basis of the remaining
contractual maturities of these instruments. The remaining
maturities presented in the following table provide an overview
of the timing of the cash flows related to these instruments.
Financial assets are not linked to financial liabilities in order to
meet cash outflows on these liabilities.

Market risk
Market risk can be subdivided into interest rate risk, currency risk and price risk.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that adverse movements of interest rates lead to high costs on interest-bearing debt or assets, which
negatively impact the company's capability to honor its commitments. DSM's interest rate risk policy is aimed at minimizing the
interest rate risks associated with the financing of the company and thus at the same time optimizing the net interest costs. This
policy translates into a certain desired profile of fixed-interest and floating-interest positions, including cash and cash equivalents,
with the floating-interest position not exceeding 60% of net debt.
At 31 December 2018, there was neither debt carried at a floating interest rate (same as 2017), nor outstanding fixed-floating
interest rate swaps (end of 2017 none).
The following analysis of the sensitivity of borrowings, assets and related financial derivatives to interest rate movements assumes
an instantaneous 1% change in interest rates for all maturities from their level on 31 December 2018, with all other variables held
constant. A 1% reduction in interest rates would result in a € 25 million pre-tax loss in the income statement and equity on the
basis of the composition of financial instruments on 31 December 2018, as floating-rate borrowings are more than compensated
for by floating-rate assets (mainly cash). The opposite applies in the case of a 1% increase in interest rates. The sensitivity of financial
instruments on 31 December 2018 to changes in interest rates is set out in the following table:

Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that adverse movements of foreign currency rates lead to losses on assets or liabilities in currencies, which
negatively impacts the results of operations and financial condition of the company. It is DSM's policy to hedge 100% of the currency
risks resulting from sales and purchases at the moment of recognition of the receivables and payables. This is realized by transferring
at spot rates the respective exposures to the group, which are, consequently (on a netted basis), hedged externally. In addition,
operating companies may — under strict conditions — opt for hedging currency risks from firm commitments and forecasted
transactions. The currencies giving rise to these risks are primarily USD, CHF, GBP and JPY. The risks arising from currency
exposures are regularly reviewed and hedged when appropriate. DSM uses average-rate currency forward contracts, currency
forward contracts, spot contracts, and average-rate currency options to hedge the exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates. At year-end, these instruments had remaining maturities of less than one year. For the hedging of currency risks from firm
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  200 www.dsm.comcommitments and forecasted transaction cash flows, hedge accounting is applied. Hedge accounting is not applied for hedges of
recognized trade receivables and trade payables hedged with short-term derivatives.
To hedge intercompany loans, receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the
subsidiaries, DSM uses currency swaps or forward contracts.
The following analysis of the sensitivity of net borrowings and derivative financial instruments to currency movements against the
euro assumes a 10% change in all foreign currency rates against the euro from their level on 31 December, with all other variables
held constant. A +10% change indicates a strengthening of the foreign currencies against the euro. A -10% change represents a
weakening of the foreign currencies against the euro.

Price risk
Financial instruments that are subject to changes in stock exchange prices or indexes are subject to a price risk. At year-end 2018,
price risks related to investments in securities were limited.Consolidated financial statements — Notes to the consolidated financial statements of Royal DSM
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  201 www.dsm.comCredit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a (commercial or financial)
counterparty may not be able to honor a financial commitment
vis-à-vis DSM. The company manages the credit risk to which
it is exposed by applying credit limits per institution and by
dealing exclusively with institutions that have a high credit
rating.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant
concentrations of credit risks other than some financing
relationships with associates and joint ventures (see Note
10).
The expected credit loss (ECL) related to each of these
financing relationships is based on the allocation of a credit
risk grade which is based on data that is determined to be
predictive of the risk of loss (including but not limited to external
ratings, audited financial statements, management accounts
and cash flow projections and available press information
about customers) and applying experienced credit judgement.
Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative
factors that are indicative of the risk of default and are aligned
to external credit rating definitions from Moody's.
The loss allowance that has been taken into consideration at
the start and the end of 2018 was below € 1 million.
With regard to treasury activities (for example cash, cash
equivalents and financial derivatives held with banks or
financial institutions) it is ensured that financial transactions are
only concluded with counterparties that have at least a
Moody's credit rating of A3 for long-term instruments. At
business group level, outstanding receivables are
continuously monitored by management. Appropriate
allowances are made for any credit risks that have been
identified in line with the expected credit loss policy. It is
therefore unlikely that significant losses will arise in relation to
receivables that have not been provided for.
In line with IFRS 9 standard 'Financial Instruments', the
estimation of the value adjustment for doubtful accounts
receivable is now based on an Expected credit loss (ECL)
model. This change has not led to material changes upon
transition. DSM uses an allowance matrix to measure the ECL
for trade receivables. The loss rates depend on the specified
aging categories and are based on historical write-off
percentages. The applied loss rates are calculated separately
for exposures in different business segments as these could
vary based on the type of customers, type of sales, and the
historical write-off date.The table below provides information about the credit risk
exposure per aging category and the ECL for trade receivables
of € 1,395 million at 31 December 2018, see Note 13 'Current
receivables'.

The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the
carrying amounts of financial assets that are recognized in the
balance sheet, including derivative financial instruments. DSM
has International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)
agreements in place with its financial counterparties that allow
for the netting of exposures in case of a default of either party.
No significant agreements or financial instruments were
available at the reporting date that would reduce the maximum
exposure to credit risk.

DSM's policy is to grant corporate guarantees for credit
support of subsidiaries and associates, to get access to credit
facilities which are necessary for their operating working
capital needs and which cannot be funded by the corporate
cash pools and/or for bank guarantees needed for local
governmental requirements. Information on guarantees is
presented in Note 22 'Contingent liabilities and other financial
obligations'.
Hedge accounting
DSM uses derivative financial instruments to manage financial
risks relating to business operations and does not enter into
speculative derivative positions. The purpose of cash flow
hedges is to minimize the risk of volatility of future cash flows.
These may result from a recognized asset or liability or a
forecast transaction that is considered highly probable (firm
commitment). The hedge ratio is dependent on the risk
analysis related to the specific cash flow, and can vary from
50 to 100%. Changes in fair value are recognized in Other
comprehensive income (Hedging reserve), and material
ineffectiveness (mainly as a result of changes in timing of the
hedged transactions) will be recognized in the income
statement. As soon as the forecast transaction is realized (the
underlying hedged item materializes), the amount recognized
in the Other comprehensive income will be reclassified to the
income statement. In case the hedged future transaction is a
non-financial asset or liability, the gain or loss recognized in
Other comprehensive income will be included in the cost of
acquisition of the asset or liability.
The purpose of a hedge of a net investment is to reduce the
foreign currency risk of an investment in a company whose
functional currency is not the euro. Changes in fair value are
recognized in Other comprehensive income (Translation
reserve), and material ineffectiveness will be recognized in the
income statement. The amount recognized in the Othercomprehensive income will be reclassified to the income
statement, upon divestment of the respective foreign
subsidiary.
The purpose of a fair value hedge is to hedge the fair value of
assets or liabilities reflected on the balance sheet. Changes of
fair value in hedging instruments, as well as hedged items, will
be recognized in the income statement.
Cash flow hedges
In 2018, DSM hedged USD 654 million (2017: USD 570 million)
of its 2019 projected net cash flow in USD against the EUR by
means of average-rate currency forward contracts at an
average exchange rate of USD 1.22 per EUR for the four
quarters of 2019. Each quarter, the relevant hedges for that
quarter will be settled and recognized in the income statement.
In 2018, DSM also hedged JPY 6,550 million (2017: JPY 5,550
million) of its 2019 projected net cash flow in JPY against the
EUR by means of average-rate currency forward contracts at
an average exchange rate of JPY 130 per EUR for the four
quarters of 2019. DSM also hedged the projected CHF
obligations against the EUR, namely CHF 262 million at an
average exchange rate of CHF 1.15 per EUR. DSM
discontinued the hedge of projected GBP cash obligations
against CHF. These hedges have fixed the exchange rate for
part of the USD and JPY receipts and CHF payments in 2019.
Cash flow hedge accounting is applied for these hedges. As
a result of similar hedges concluded in 2017 for the year 2018,
€ 1 million positive (2017: € 10 million negative) was
recognized in the 2018 operating profit of the segments
involved in accordance with the realization of the expected
cash flows. There was no material ineffectiveness in relation to
these hedges.
Net investment hedges
The partial hedging of the currency risk associated with the
translation of DSM's CHF-denominated investments was
continued for an amount of € 474 million (2017: CHF 204
million). There was no material ineffectiveness in relation to
these hedges.

Fair value of financial instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used to determine the fair value of financial instruments: cash, current investments,
current receivables, current borrowings (excluding current portion of long-term instruments) and other current liabilities are stated
at carrying amount, which approximates fair value in view of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of financial
derivatives and long-term instruments are based on calculations, quoted market prices or quotes obtained from intermediaries.
The portfolio of derivatives consists of average-rate forward contracts that are valued against average foreign exchange forward
rates obtained from Bloomberg and other derivatives that are valued using a discounted cash flow model, applicable market yield
curves and foreign exchange spot rates. Inputs for the fair value calculations represent observable market data that are obtained
from external sources that are deemed to be independent and reliable.
DSM uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments:
- Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
- Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value are observable, either directly or
indirectly
- Level 3: techniques that use inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value that are not based on observable market data
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in
the fair value hierarchy.

24 Post-employment benefits
The group operates a number of defined benefit plans and
defined contribution plans throughout the world, the assets of
which are generally held in separately administered funds. The
pension plans are generally funded by payments from
employees and from the relevant group companies. The group
also provides certain additional healthcare benefits to retired
employees in the US.
Post-employment benefits relate to obligations that will be
settled in the future and require assumptions to project benefit
obligations. Post-employment benefit accounting is intended
to reflect the recognition of post-employment benefits over the
employee's approximate service period, based on the terms
of the plans and the investment and funding. The accounting
requires management to make assumptions regarding
variables such as discount rate, future salary increases, life
expectancy, and future healthcare costs. Management
consults with external actuaries regarding these assumptions
at least annually for significant plans.
Changes in these key assumptions can have a significant
impact on the projected defined benefit obligations, funding
requirements and periodic costs incurred.

Balance at 31 December 458 394
The Employee benefit net liabilities of € 458 million
(2017: € 394 million) consist of € 438 million related to
pensions (2017: €  374 million), € 6 million related to healthcare
and other costs (2017: € 6 million) and € 14 million related to
other post-employment benefits (2017: € 14 million).
Pensions
The DSM group companies have various pension plans, which
are geared to the local regulations and practices in the
countries in which they operate. As these plans are designed
to comply with the statutory framework, tax legislation, local
customs and economic situation of the countries concerned,
it follows that the nature of the plans varies from country to
country. The plans are based on local legal and contractual
obligations.
DSM's current policy is to offer defined contribution retirement
benefit plans to new employees wherever possible. However,
DSM still has a (small) number of defined benefit pension and
healthcare schemes from the past or in countries where
legislation does not allow us to offer a defined contribution
scheme. Generally, these schemes have been funded through
external trusts or foundations, where DSM faces the potential
risk of funding shortfalls. The most significant defined benefit
schemes are:
- Pension Plan at DSM Nutritional Products AG in
Switzerland (DNP AG)
- DSM UK Pension Scheme in the UK
- Consolidated Pension Plan of DSM North America, Inc. in
the US
- Pension Plan at DSM Nutritional Products GmbH in
Germany (DNP GmbH)
For each plan, the following characteristics are relevant:DNP AG Pension Plan in Switzerland
The DNP AG Pension Plan is a typical Swiss Cash Balance
plan. For accounting purposes, this plan is qualified as a
defined benefit plan. It is a contribution based-plan. There is
no promise of indexation for on-going pensions. The Swiss
state minimal requirements for occupational benefit plans have
however to be respected; the Minimum Guaranteed Interest
Return on the cash balance accounts for 2018 was 1.00%
(2017: 1.00%) for the mandatory portion (BVG/LPP). There is
also a minimal conversion rate applicable. The weighted
average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 12.4 years
(2017: 12.9 years) which could be seen as an indication of the
maturity profile of the scheme.
The pension plan is managed and controlled by a DSM
company pension fund. The Board of Trustees consists of
representatives of the employer and the employees who have
an independent role. In 2018, the Trustees agreed to a
reduction of the conversion rate for both the accounts related
to the higher and the lower income. This has reduced the
pension liabilities in Switzerland. The Trustees also agreed to
remove the over mandatory risk benefits to a separate over
mandatory pension fund where a mandatory risk insurance is
applicable. The plan assets are collectively invested (no
individual investment choice). The current (estimated) funding
level, based on local standards, is 108% (2017: 119%), which
is above the legally required minimum funding level but below
the long-term buffer target. 
DSM UK Pension Scheme
The DSM UK Pension Scheme was closed as of 30
September 2016 for all pension accruals. An unconditional
indexation policy is applicable for the vested pension rights.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit
obligation is 19.4 years (2017: 20.7 years), which could be
seen as an indication of the maturity profile of the scheme.
The pension plan is managed and controlled by a DSM
company pension fund. The Board of Trustees consists of
representatives of the employer and the employees who have
an independent role. Following judgement in the Lloyds case
(October 2018) with respect to Guaranteed Minimum
Pensions (GMP), DSM estimated that equalization of GMPs
will increase the liabilities by approximately 0.6%. As agreed
during the 2015 valuation DSM pays an annual recovery
contribution of GBP 1 million into the plan. There are two
company guarantees in place: (1) a guarantee from DNP AG
(capped at GBP 14 million) related to the 2012 valuation, and
(2) a guarantee from Royal DSM (capped at GBP 11 million)
related to arrangements with respect to former UK
divestments. There is a long-term de-risking strategy for the
DSM UK Pension Scheme in place with the objective to align
the company's intentions and the Trustees responsibility with
respect to this plan. The current funding level, based on local
standards, is estimated at 98% (2017: 103%).Consolidated financial statements — Notes to the consolidated financial statements of Royal DSM
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  207 www.dsm.comConsolidated Plan in the US
The Consolidated Plan in the US has been closed to new
entrants since 2014. As of 31 December 2016, the plan was
closed for pension accrual of the non-unionized employees.
New accrual is only applicable for a small group of unionized
employees. There is no indexation applicable for the vested
pension rights. The weighted average duration of the defined
obligations is 11.8 years (2017: 12.8 years), which could be
seen as an indication of the maturity profile of the scheme.
The pension plan is managed and controlled by a DSM
company pension fund. The Board of Trustees consists of
representatives of the employer and the employees who have
an independent role.
In 2018, an ALM study was performed which will lead to an
adjustment of the investment strategy that will be implemented
in the course of 2019. The internal funding policy of this plan
is based on IFRS valuation. This implies a stricter funding
policy than the minimum requirements on local funding. The
current IFRS funding level is 95% (2017: 97%), whereas the
funding level on local standards (Pension Protection Act) is
estimated at 109% (2017: 129%). The minimum required
funding level on local standards is 80% on the basis of this Act.
DNP GmbH Pension Plan in Germany
The DNP GmbH Pension Plan in Germany has been closed to
new entrants as of 31 December 2008. Accrual is still
applicable for employees who have been participating in the
plan since 2008. The pension plan is a final pay pension plan
(averaged over the last 12 months prior to retirement) and
service-related benefit. The liability is on the balance sheet of
DNP GmbH. No assets are allocated to this liability. All
reimbursements will be paid out by the local company. The
weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is
15.5 years (2017: 15.6 years) which could be seen as an
indication of the maturity profile of the scheme.
The most important unfunded plans are in Germany for which
the associated liability amounts to € 308 million (2017:
€ 297 million).

Sensitivities of significant actuarial assumptions
The discount rate, the future increase in wages and salaries and the pension increase rate were identified as significant actuarial
assumptions. The following impacts on the defined benefit obligation are to be expected:
- A 0.25% increase/decrease in the discount rate would lead to a decrease/increase of 3.2% (2017: 3.6%) in the defined benefit
obligation
-A 0.25% increase/decrease in the expected increase in salaries/wages would lead to an increase/decrease of 0.3% (2017: 0.3%)
in the defined benefit obligation
- A 0.25% increase/decrease in the expected rate of pension increase would lead to an increase/decrease of less than 1.0%
(2017:1.1%) in the defined benefit obligation
The sensitivity analysis is based on realistically possible changes as of the end of the reporting year. Each change in a significant
actuarial assumption was analyzed separately as part of the test. Interdependencies were not taken into account.
Healthcare and other costs
In some countries, particularly in the US, group companies provide retired employees and their surviving dependents with post-
employment benefits other than pensions, mainly allowances for healthcare expenses and life-insurance premiums. Some of these
are unfunded; in these cases, approved expense claims are reimbursed out of the financial resources of the group companies
concerned. These plans are not sufficiently material to warrant the individual disclosures required by IAS 19.

The cash flow statement provides an explanation of the changes in cash and cash equivalents. It is prepared on the basis of a
comparison of the balance sheets at 1 January and 31 December. Changes that do not involve cash flows, such as changes in
exchange rates, amortization, depreciation, impairment losses and transfers to other balance sheet items, are eliminated.
Changes in working capital due to the acquisition or disposal of consolidated companies are included under Investing activities.
Most of the changes in the cash flow statement can be traced back to the detailed statements of changes for the balance sheet
items concerned. For those balance sheet items for which no detailed statement of changes is included, the table below shows
the link between the change according to the balance sheet and the change according to the cash flow statement:

27 Share-based compensation
The DSM Stock Incentive Plan provides rules for the grant of Restricted Share Units (RSU) and Performance Share Units (PSU),
which have been granted as of 2017 to executives. The grant date of these management share units is the last trading day at the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange in March.
The number of management share units to be granted is based on the face value of the DSM share. The grant value (depending
on job level) to eligible employees will be divided by the share price at the beginning of the first performance year. As a result, the
number of share units to be granted annually will fluctuate with the share price development. The grant concerns the maximum
number of Restricted Share Units (RSUs) and Performance Share Units (PSUs) that may vest.
RSUs and PSUs are subject to a vesting period of 3 years starting at the grant date. Vesting of RSUs is subject to continued
employment until the vesting date (‘time vesting'); vesting of PSUs is in addition subject to the achievement of predetermined
performance goals at the end of the vesting period. The PSUs granted in 2018 are subject to the realization of four equally weighted
goals:
- Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance versus a peer group
- Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) growth
- Energy Efficiency Improvement (EEI)
- Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE) Efficiency Improvement
Non-vested share units will be forfeited. If employment is terminated prior to the vesting date, specific rules regarding vesting and
forfeitures apply.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  212 www.dsm.comPrior to 2017, stock options were granted to eligible staff. Stock options have a term of 8 years and are subject to a vesting period
of 3 years. Like RSUs, non-performance related stock options are subject to ‘time vesting', whereas the vesting of performance
related stock options depends on the realization of the same predefined performance goals as applicable to PSUs. Vested stock
options can be exercised during a period of 5 years starting as per vesting date, subject to the plan rules. Unvested stock options
will be forfeited. If employment is terminated prior to the vesting date, specific rules regarding vesting and forfeitures apply.
Share-based compensation regarding the Managing Board is included in Note 13 'Remuneration of Managing Board and
Supervisory Board' to the Financial statements of the parent company.
Share units and stock options are settled by delivery of DSM shares.

set for 2018 and 2019. Settlement in shares takes place after this two-year period. If employment is terminated prior to the
settlement date, specific rules regarding vesting and forfeitures apply. Under this plan a total of 39,546 shares was granted, of
which at the end of 2018 36,967 shares were outstanding and 2,579 were forfeited. The fair value of these shares is determined
based on the market price at the end of the first quarter of 2018, adjusted for loss of dividend.
Certain employees in the Netherlands are entitled to employee stock options, to be granted on the first day on which the DSM
stock is quoted ex-dividend following the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. The opening price of the DSM stock on that
day is the exercise price of such stock options. Employee stock options can immediately be exercised and have a term of five
years.

Measurement of fair value
The costs of management share units are measured by reference to the fair value of the DSM share at the date on which the
management share units are granted, ex-dividend as the share units do not accumulate dividend during the three-year vesting
period.
The costs of option plans are measured by reference to the fair value of the options at the date on which the options are granted.
The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model, taking into account market conditions linked to the price of the DSM
share. Stock-price volatility is determined on the basis of historical volatilities of the DSM share price measured each month over
a period equal to the expected option life. The costs of these options are recognized in the income statement (Employee benefit
costs).

In 2018, an amount of € 423 million was transferred from
retained earnings to other reserves in order to apply a
consistent treatment with the consolidated financial
statements.
Legal reserve
In Shareholders' equity, an amount of € 37 million (2017:
-€ 107 million) is included for Translation reserve,
-€ 166 million (2017: -€ 148 million) for Hedging reserve,
€ 21 million (2017: € 5 million) for Fair value reserve and
€ 253 million (2017: € 182 million)  for intangible assets related
to product development projects. In addition, a legal reserve
of € 108 million (2017: € 126 million) is recognized for profits
that cannot be distributed and received in the Netherlands.
Profit appropriation
According to article 32 of the Articles of Association of
Koninklijke DSM N.V. and with the approval of the Supervisory
Board, every year the Managing Board determines the portion
of the net profit to be appropriated to the reserves. For the year2018, the net profit is € 1,077 million (2017: € 1,769 million)
and the amount to be appropriated to the reserves has been
established at € 665 million (2017: € 1,438 million). From the
subsequent balance of the net profit of € 412 million (2017:
€ 331 million), dividend is first distributed on the cumulative
preference shares B. At the end of 2018 no cumprefs B were
in issue (same as for 2017). Subsequently, a 3.26% (2017:
3.26%) dividend is distributed on the cumulative preference
shares A, based on a share price of € 5.29 (2017: € 5.29) per
cumulative preference share A. For 2018, this distribution
amounts to € 0.17 (2017: € 0.17) per share, which is
€ 8 million in total. An interim dividend of € 0.06  per cumulative
preference share A having been paid in August 2018, the final
dividend will then amount to € 0.11  per cumulative preference
share A.
The profit remaining after distribution of these dividends on the
cumulative preference shares A of € 1,069 million (2017:
€ 1,761 million) will be put at the disposal of the Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders in accordance with the provisions of
Article 32, section 5 of the Articles of Association.
The Managing Board proposes a dividend on ordinary shares
outstanding for the year 2018 of € 2.30 (2017: € 1.85) per
share. With an interim dividend of € 0.77 (2017: € 0.58) per
ordinary share having been paid in August 2017, the final
dividend would then amount to € 1.53 (2017: € 1.27) per
ordinary share.
If the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders makes a
decision in accordance with the proposal, the net profit will be
appropriated as follows:

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  223 www.dsm.com13 Remuneration of Managing Board and Supervisory
Board
Remuneration Managing Board in 2018
The actual remuneration of the members of the Managing
Board is determined by the Supervisory Board within the
framework of the Remuneration Policy as approved by the
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. More details on the
'Remuneration policy Managing Board' on page 131 are
included in the 'Report by the Supervisory Board'.
Base salary in 2018
Base salaries have been adjusted at the discretion of the
Supervisory Board taking into consideration the 'general
increase' (market movement) for DSM executives in the
Netherlands as well as the general movements of the labor-
market peer group as described in our remuneration policy.
On average the adjustment amounts to 2.7% (CEO 2.4% and
members Managing Board 2.9%).

Short-Term Incentives (STI) for 2018
STI targets are revised annually to ensure that they are
stretching but realistic. Considerations regarding the
performance targets are influenced by the operational and
strategic course taken by the company and are directly linked
to the company's ambitions. The targets are determined at the
beginning of the year for each Board member.
Target STI level and pay-out
The on target STI level set in the remuneration policy is 50%
of annual base salary. Excellent over-achievement may
increase the STI pay-out to 100% of the annual base salary.
This Report presents the Short-Term Incentives earned on the
basis of the results achieved in 2018. These Short-Term
Incentives will be paid out in 2019.
The Supervisory Board has established the extent to which the
targets set for 2018 were achieved, resulting in an average
overall achievement of 80%, compared to 75% in 2017. All
targets for 2018 were set in line with the published strategic,
financial and sustainability goals. The financial targets
Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Free Cash Flow and Net sales growth
have all been achieved at maximum level. For the sustainability
targets, the score on Brighter Living Solutions was on target,
and the score on the Employee Engagement Index was
significantly overachieved. The Safety Performance score
was, disappointingly, below target. Managing Board membersalso have individual targets. The scores achieved on these
targets were above target. The realization of the 2018 financial
STI targets has been assessed by KPMG. Furthermore, KPMG
has assessed the validation process for target realization of
the non-financial STI targets.
Under the STI Deferral and Share Matching Plan, only part of
the STI outcome is paid in cash: 25% of the gross STI pay-out
is mandatorily converted into DSM Investment Shares. In
addition, Managing Board members may decide to convert an
additional part of the STI pay-out into Investment Shares
(minimum 5%; maximum 25%; incremental steps of 5%). The
company matches these STI Investment Shares with an
equivalent number of Performance Share Units (PSUs),
vesting after three years, subject to holding the Investment
Shares during the vesting period and the achievement of
predefined performance targets equivalent to the measures
under the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan. The remainder (if any
left after deduction for tax) of the STI pay-out (50% to
maximum 75%) is delivered in cash.

All members of the Managing Board decided to invest the
maximum of 50% of their gross 2017 STI (payable in 2018) in
accordance with the STI Deferral and Share Matching Plan. In
all cases, these Investment Shares were matched with an
equal number of Performance Share Units (PSUs). This was
also the case with the gross 2018 STI (to be paid in 2019).

- Chairman 18,500
- Members 12,500
For an overview of all granted and vested stock options and
Performance Shares, see 'Overview of stock options' on page
227.
In 2018, the Supervisory Board determined the vesting of the
Performance Shares granted in 2015. The following
performance measures applied to the 2015 grant: relative
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) versus peer group, Return on
Capital Employed (ROCE), Energy Efficiency Improvement
(EEI) and the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE) Efficiency
Improvement, each determining 25% of the total vesting
percentage. The applicable vesting schemes were published
in DSM's 2015 Integrated Annual Report. DSM's TSR
performance resulted in a vesting above target level yet below
maximum; the performance on the remaining targets (Return
on Capital Employed, Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Energy
Efficiency Index) resulted in maximum vesting. This strong
performance on all financial and non-financial parameters over
the last 3 years resulted in a clear increase in the number of
shares vested (much smaller number of shares forfeited) to
142.5% of target. As explained in the remuneration policy,
based on face value, the initial grant equals 150% of target,
therefore this performance leads to the vesting of 95% of the
number of shares granted in 2015.
Pensions in 2018
The members of the Managing Board participate in the Dutch
pension fund Stichting Pensioenfonds DSM Nederland (PDN).
This pension scheme for the Managing Board is equal to the
pension scheme for other DSM employees in the Netherlands.
Reference is made to the website of the pension fund.
Revision and claw-back of incentives
As in 2017, no revision or claw-back of any incentives
occurred in 2018.
Pay ratio
Under the Dutch Corporate Governance Code companies are
required to publish a pay ratio. As the code does not provide
a definition of the pay ratio, the calculation method applied will
vary per company, which will make the pay ratio data
incomparable. The pay ratio per company will also differ year
on year, since the variable pay (as a percentage of annual base
salary) of the CEO/Managing Board is typically much higher
(100% at target) than the variable pay of the comparable
average employee group (about 5-10% of annual base pay),
and this variable pay will fluctuate with business results. On
top of that, different regions of the world have different pay
structures, so acquisitions/divestments, growth in certain
areas and foreign exchange rates will equally influence the payratio. DSM complies with the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code in providing a pay ratio, as measured per 31 December
2018.
The pay ratio calculated versus the Dutch employee
remuneration average, will be 26:1 (2017: 20:1) (compared to
CEO remuneration) or 20:1 (2017: 16:1) (compared to average
Managing Board remuneration). This is based on total cost of
€ 503 million in the Netherlands (which includes the
remuneration of the Managing Board and has been deducted
in the ratio calculation) and a head count in the Netherlands of
3,827 as per 31 December 2018. The increase is due to the
higher number of shares that now vested (so a lower number
of shares that were forfeited over the period 2015-2017) of the
total number of shares that were granted in 2015, due to the
good performance of the company.
The ratio of total remuneration, including annual base salary,
Short-Term Incentive, Long-Term Incentive and other benefits
such as pension (as reported in this Integrated Annual Report)
versus the average of total global employee (i.e. including
Dutch) remuneration is for the CEO 40:1 (2017: 32:1). The pay
ratio of the average Managing Board total remuneration versus
the average of total global employee remuneration is 31:1
(2017: 25:1). The increase is due to the explanation given
above.
However, if the pay ratio is calculated on the basis of the
estimated vesting %, so without the additional non-cash
vesting of shares for the series 2015-2017, the pay ratio
compared to the Dutch employee average for the CEO would
be 22:1 (2017: 20:1) and for the average of the Managing
Board remuneration 17:1 (2017: 16:1). Compared to the total
global employee remuneration these would be 34:1 (2017:
32:1) for the CEO and 26:1 (2017: 25:1) for the average of the
Managing Board.

from table 'DSM's remuneration expense for the Managing
Board and the Executive Committee' (see next table) and the
accompanying Note explaining the adjustment in the column

1Share-based compensation expense represents the non-cash cost for DSM of performance shares awarded to members of the Managing Board and stock options to other
members of the Executive Committee. These costs are recognized over the vesting period of the performance shares and stock options and therefore cover several years. The
percentage of vesting of shares and stock options will determine the final income for the Managing Board and Executive Committee members.

Note:
The above reported figures include in the column Share-based compensation 2018 amounts related to the period 2015–2017 as
a result of shares that vested in 2018 at a percentage higher than previously estimated (so a lower percentage of shares that were
forfeited over the period 2015-2017), due to the good performance of the company over the recent years. In accordance with
IFRS2 this has been adjusted. The adjustment concerns € 565,000, € 348,000 and € 367,000 (and € 1,280,000 in total) for
respectively Feike Sijbesma, Geraldine Matchett and Dimitri de Vreeze. Without this adjustment for accounting purposes, the
expenses for share based compensation would be € 850,000 for Feike Sijbesma ( total remuneration expenses would amount to
€ 2,814,000); € 585,000 for Geraldine Matchett ( total remuneration expenses would amount to  € 1,921,000) and € 555,000 for

To: the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders and the
Supervisory Board of Koninklijke DSM N.V.
Report on the audit of the financial statements 2018
included in the Integrated Annual Report
Our opinion
In our opinion:
-the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a
true and fair view of the financial position of Koninklijke DSM
N.V. (hereafter: Royal DSM) as at 31 December 2018 and
of its result and its cash flows for the year then ended, in
accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS)
and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
- the accompanying parent company financial statements
give a true and fair view of the financial position of Royal DSM
as at 31 December 2018 and of its result for the year then
ended in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil
Code.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements 2018 of Royal DSM
based in Heerlen. The financial statements include the
consolidated financial statements and the parent company
financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements comprise:
- the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2018;
-the following consolidated statements for 2018: the income
statement, the statements of comprehensive income,
changes in equity and cash flows; and
- the notes comprising a summary of the significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The parent company financial statements comprise:
- the parent company balance sheet as at 31 December
2018;
- the parent company income statement for 2018; and
-the notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies
and other explanatory information.
Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law,
including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in
the 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements' section of our report.
We are independent of Royal DSM in accordance with the EU
Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audits
of public-interest entities, the 'Wet toezicht
accountantsorganisaties' (Wta, Audit firms supervision act),
the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants
bij assurance-opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics forProfessional Accountants, a regulation with respect to
independence) and other relevant independence regulations
in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the
'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels
accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

resulting in a coverage of 73% of net sales and
  80% of total assets

Opinion
• Unqualified  
Materiality
Based on our professional judgement we determined the
materiality for the financial statements as a whole at € 40
million (2017: € 30 million). The materiality is determined with
reference to adjusted profit before tax (Note 2: €  1,244 million;
2017: €  853 million) of which it represents 3.2% (2017: 3.5%).
In addition, the appropriateness of the materiality was
assessed by comparing the amount to consolidated net sales
of which it represents 0.4% (2017: 0.3%). We have also taken
into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements
that in our opinion are material for qualitative reasons for the
users of the financial statements.
We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in
excess of € 1.5 million (2017: € 1 million) which are identified
during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller
misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative
grounds .
Scope of the group audit
Royal DSM is at the head of a group of reporting entities
(hereafter: entities). The financial information of this group is
included in the financial statements of Royal DSM.
Because we are ultimately responsible for the auditor's report,
we are also responsible for directing, supervising and
performing the group audit. In this respect we have
determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures toOther information
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  230 www.dsm.combe carried out for entities reporting for group audit purposes.
Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the entities or
operations. On this basis, we selected 22 entities (2017: 25
entities) to perform audits for group reporting purposes on a
complete set of financial information as well as 17 entities
(2017: 17 entities) to perform specified audit procedures for
group reporting purposes on specific items of financial
information.
This resulted in a coverage of 73% (2017: 73%) of total net
sales and 80% (2017: 80%) of total assets. The remaining 27%
of total net sales (2017: 27%) and 20% of total assets (2017:
20%) is represented by a significant number of entities
('Remaining entities'), none of which individually represents
more than 2% of total net sales and 1% of total assets.
For these remaining entities, we performed amongst others
analytical procedures at (business) group level to validate our
assessment that there are no significant risks of material
misstatement within these entities.
The audit coverage as stated above can be further specified
as follows:

We have:
- performed audit procedures ourselves at (business) group
level in respect of areas such as the annual goodwill
impairment tests, other (in)tangible asset impairments,
accounting for associates and joint ventures, valuation of
deferred tax assets, acquisitions, disposals, restructurings,
treasury and shared service centers; and
- used the work of local KPMG auditors when auditing or
performing specified audit procedures at business group
and local entity level;
The group audit team has set materiality levels for the entities,
which ranged from €  5 million to €  12.5 million (2017: €  5 million
to € 12.5 million), based on the mix of size and risk profile of
the entities within the group.The group audit team provided detailed instructions to all
business group and local entity auditors part of the group
audit, covering the significant audit areas, including the
relevant risks of material misstatement, and the information
required to be reported back to the group audit team. The
group audit team visited entity locations in the United States
of America, Switzerland, China, Brazil and the shared service
center in India.
Telephone conferences were held with all entity auditors part
of the group audit. During these visits and telephone
conferences, we discussed the audit approach and the audit
findings and observations reported to the group audit team.
For a number of these entities we also performed file reviews.
By performing the procedures mentioned above at reporting
entities, together with additional procedures at (business)
group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and
appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial
information to provide an opinion about the financial
statements.
Audit scope in relation to fraud
In accordance with the Dutch Standards on Auditing we are
responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance that the
financial statements taken as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. As part of our
fraud risk assessment we:
- made use of management's evaluation in relation to fraud
risk management (prevention, detections and response);
- assessed Royal DSM's entity level controls which include
ethical standards to create a culture of honesty;
- assessed events or conditions that indicate an incentive or
pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to
commit fraud ('fraud risk factors'); and
- involved a KPMG forensic specialist.
Based on our fraud risk assessment, we have not identified
any fraud risks in addition to those presumed by the Auditing
Standards. Those presumed risks were relevant to our audit
and have been discussed with the Managing and Supervisory
Board, and are as follows:
- fraud risk in relation to revenue recognition, specifically
being the risk of manual override with respect to the cut-off
of revenue for the period prior to the financial year-end; and
- fraud risk in relation to management override of controls to
meet targets and/or expectations.
Our audit procedures included an evaluation of the design and
implementation of internal controls relevant to mitigate these
fraud risks and supplementary substantive audit procedures,
including detailed testing of high risk journal entries, inspection
and testing of documentation such as agreements with the
customer and shipping documents, in relation to the correct
recognition of revenues for the period prior to the financialOther information — Independent auditor's report
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  231 www.dsm.comyear-end and an evaluation of key estimates and judgment by
management.
Our audit procedures differ from a specific forensic fraud
investigation, which investigation often has a more in-depth
character.
Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the
financial statements. We have communicated the key audit
matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are
not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of
the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these
matters.
Compared to last year we have added as a key audit matter
the divestment of Royal DSM's investment in DSM Sinochem
Pharmaceuticals as the accounting for this transaction is
significant for the financial statements. Last year's key audit
matters about the Impairment of joint venture POET – DSM
Advanced Biofuels LLC and the Divestment of Patheon N.V.
are not included anymore in 2018, given the decreased risk
profile of the valuation of DSM's investment in POET – DSM
Advanced Biofuels LLC and the one-off nature of the
divestment of Patheon N.V.
Valuation of goodwill
Description
Royal DSM carries a significant amount of goodwill in the
balance sheet. Under EU-IFRSs, Royal DSM is required to test
the amount of goodwill for impairment at least annually. The
impairment tests were significant to our audit due to the
complexity of the assessment process and judgments and
assumptions involved which are affected by expected future
market and economic developments.
Our response
We challenged the cash flow projections included in the annual
goodwill impairment tests. Our audit procedures included,
amongst others, the involvement of a valuation specialist to
assist us in evaluating the assumptions, in particular the
terminal growth and pre-tax discount rates, and the valuation
methodology used by Royal DSM. We furthermore assessed
the appropriateness of other data used by comparing them to
external and historical data, such as external market growth
expectations and by analyzing sensitivities in Royal DSM's
valuation model. We specifically focused on the sensitivity in
the available headroom for the cash generating units,
evaluating whether a reasonably possible change in keyassumptions could cause the carrying amount to exceed its
recoverable amount and assessed the historical accuracy of
management's estimates. We assessed the adequacy of the
disclosure (Note 8) to the financial statements.
Our observation
We consider management's key assumptions and estimates
to be within the acceptable range and we assessed the
disclosure (Note 8) to the financial statements as being
proportionate.
Divestment of DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals
Description
On 31 October 2018 Royal DSM completed the sale of its
investment in DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals. This sale
resulted in a gain on disposal of € 109 million. Given the
amounts involved as disclosed in Note 10 to the financial
statements, the accounting for this transaction is significant for
the financial statements.
Our response
We tested the accuracy and completeness of the gain on the
disposal by comparing the consideration received with the
terms and conditions according to the Share Purchase
Agreement (SPA), the cash receipts and by reconciling the
book value of the disposed amount to the underlying
accounting records. We verified whether the gain on disposal
was calculated in accordance with the relevant clauses of the
SPA underlying the transaction. When verifying the gain on
disposal we assessed the net present value of the earn-out
receivable which is linked to future performance of the
divested business. We also evaluated the adequacy of the
disclosure (Note 10) of this disposal in the financial statements.
Our observation
We consider that the gain on disposal is appropriately reflected
in the financial statements and we assessed the disclosure
(Note 10) to the financial statements as being proportionate.
Report on the other information included in the Integrated
Annual Report
In addition to the financial statements and our auditor's report
thereon, the Integrated Annual Report contains other
information that consists of:
-Report by the Managing Board which includes the chapters
Key data, Letter from the CEO, Report by the Managing
Board, Review of business, Reporting policies and
Corporate governance and risk management;
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  232 www.dsm.com- Report by the Supervisory Board which includes the
chapters Report by the Supervisory Board and Supervisory
Board and Managing Board Royal DSM;
-Other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch
Civil Code;
- Other information which consists of the chapters What still
went wrong in 2018, Information about the DSM share,
Sustainability statements, DSM figures: five-year summary
and Explanation of some concepts and ratios.
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude
that the other information:
- is consistent with the financial statements and does not
contain material misstatements; and
- contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of
the Dutch Civil Code.
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge
and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial
statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the
other information contains material misstatements.
By performing these procedures, we comply with the
requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and
the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures
performed is substantially less than the scope of those
performed in our audit of the financial statements.
The Managing Board is responsible for the preparation of the
other information, including the Report by the Managing Board
in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
and the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Engagement
We were engaged by the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders as auditor of Royal DSM on 7 May 2014, as of
the audit for the year 2015 and have operated as statutory
auditor ever since that financial year.
No prohibited non-audit services
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as
referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific
requirements regarding statutory audits of public-interest
entities.
Description of responsibilities regarding the financial
statements
Responsibilities of the Managing Board and the Supervisory
Board for the financial statements
The Managing Board is responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Furthermore, the Managing Board is responsible for such
internal control as the Managing Board determines isnecessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the
Managing Board is responsible for assessing Royal DSM's
ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial
reporting frameworks mentioned, the Managing Board should
prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the Managing Board either intends to
liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no
realistic alternative but to do so. The Managing Board should
disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant
doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern
in the financial statements.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing Royal
DSM's financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in
a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate
audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute,
level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material
errors and fraud during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and
extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect
of identified misstatements on our opinion.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements is included in appendix to this auditor's
report. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

E.H.W. Weusten RAOther information — Independent auditor's report
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  233 www.dsm.comAppendix: Description of our responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements
We have exercised professional judgement and have
maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in
accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical
requirements and independence requirements. Our audit
included among others:
-identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
designing and performing audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud
is higher than the risk resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
-obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the
audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Royal DSM's
internal control;
- evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by the Managing Board;
-concluding on the appropriateness of the Managing Board's
use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on Royal DSM's ability to continue as a
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained
up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events
or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue
as a going concern;
-evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of
the financial statements, including the disclosures; and
- evaluating whether the financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding,
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. In
this respect we also submit an additional report to the audit
committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation
on specific requirements regarding statutory audits of public-
interest entities. The information included in this additional
report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's
report.We provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we
have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board,
we determine the key audit matters: those matters that were
of most significance in the audit of the financial statements.
We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or
when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating
the matter is in the public interest.
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  234 www.dsm.comAssurance report of the independent
auditor
To: the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders and the
Supervisory Board of Koninklijke DSM N.V.
We have audited the sustainability information in the sections
'Letter from the CEO', 'DSM and the Sustainable
Development Goals', 'Report by the Managing Board,
consisting of Strategy 2018, Purpose, Strategy 2021, How we
create value for our stakeholders, Stakeholders, People,
Planet and the 'Sustainability Statements', as included in the
Integrated Annual Report for the year 2018 (hereafter: the
Sustainability Information) of Koninklijke DSM N.V. (hereafter:
Royal DSM), based in Heerlen, the Netherlands. An audit
engagement is aimed at obtaining reasonable assurance.
In our opinion, the Sustainability Information is prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with the GRI Sustainability
Reporting Standards and Royal DSM's internally developed
supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in the section
'Non-financial reporting policy' on page 106 of the Integrated
Annual Report.
Basis for our opinion
We have performed our audit on the Sustainability Information
in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard
3810N 'Assurance-opdrachten inzake maatschappelijke
verslagen' (Assurance engagements relating to sustainability
reports), which is a specified Dutch standard that is based on
the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE)
3000 'Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews
of Historical Financial Information'.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the
Sustainability Information' section of our report.
We are independent of Royal DSM in accordance with the
'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij
assurance-opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and
other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands.
Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening
gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code
of Ethics).
We believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.Reporting criteria
The Sustainability information needs to be read and
understood together with the reporting criteria. Royal DSM is
solely responsible for selecting and applying these reporting
criteria, taking into account applicable law and regulations
related to reporting.
The reporting criteria used for the preparation of the
sustainability information are the Sustainability Reporting
Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Royal
DSM's internally developed supplemental reporting criteria as
disclosed in the section 'Non-financial reporting policy' on
page 106 of the Integrated Annual Report.
The GRI sustainability standards are the most widely adopted
global standards for sustainability reporting and are used by
DSM for reporting publicly on its economic, environmental and
social sustainability indicators.
Scope of the group audit
Royal DSM is the parent company of a group of reporting
entities (hereafter: entities). The Sustainability Information
incorporates the consolidated information of this group of
entities.
Our group audit procedures consisted of audit procedures at
corporate, business group and at local entity level. Our
selection of entities in scope of our assurance procedures is
primarily based on the local entity's individual contribution to
the consolidated Sustainability Information. Furthermore, our
selection of entities considered relevant reporting risks and
geographical spread.
By performing our procedures at corporate, business group
and local entity level, we have been able to obtain sufficient
and appropriate assurance evidence about Royal DSM's
reported Sustainability Information to provide an opinion about
the Sustainability Information.
Our key assurance matter
Key assurance matters are those matters that, in our
professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit
of the Sustainability Information. We have communicated the
key assurance matter to the Managing Board and Supervisory
Board. The key assurance matter is not a comprehensive
reflection of all matters discussed.
This assurance matter was addressed in the context of our
audit of the Sustainability Information within the scope of our
engagement as a whole and in forming our conclusion
respectively conclusion thereon, and we do not provide a
separate opinion on the key assurance matter.Other information — Assurance report of the independent auditor
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  235 www.dsm.comThe sustainability indicator on DSM's solutions labelled as
Brighter Living Solutions was determined to be a key
assurance matter as the assessment is inherently subject to
assumptions and management judgement, whereas the
determination of other important sustainability indicators on
Safety, Health and Environment and Human Resources do
require such judgement to a lesser extent.
Brighter Living Solutions
Description
Royal DSM reports on Brighter Living Solutions ("BLS”) which
are products and services that have specific environmental or
social benefits compared to mainstream reference solutions.
The KPI is defined as revenues from BLS as a percentage of
total sales of Royal DSM. BLS was significant to our audit since
we identified that it serves as a material indicator for Royal
DSM to report on the environmental and social impact of its
solutions and because the assessment of solutions to qualify
as BLS is inherently subject to assumptions and judgement.
Our response
We evaluated the reporting process, internal controls and the
applicable definitions and criteria. We interviewed several staff
members to understand the application of these definitions
and criteria and we challenged the underlying evidence, such
as the life cycle assessments and expert opinions for solutions
classified as BLS and assessed the calculation of the BLS
percentage. Finally, we assessed whether the criteria,
assumptions and definitions are sufficiently explained in the
Integrated Annual Report and on the website of Royal DSM.
Our observation
We consider that the definitions and criteria for BLS as
described in Royal DSM's internally developed supplemental
reporting criteria on page 107 are applied and that the
assumptions are adequately explained. We also consider the
disclosure on BLS as being proportionate.
Corresponding information
In previous years no reasonable assurance, but limited
assurance has been provided on the Sustainability
Information.
Limitations to the scope of our audit
The Sustainability Information includes prospective
information such as ambitions, strategy, plans, expectations
and estimates. Inherently the actual future results are
uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on the
assumptions and achievability of prospective informationincluded in the aforementioned sections of Royal DSM's
Integrated Annual Report.
Responsibilities of the Managing Board for the
Sustainability Information
The Managing Board of Royal DSM is responsible for the
preparation of the Sustainability Information in accordance
with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards and Royal
DSM's internally developed supplemental reporting criteria as
disclosed in the section 'Non-financial reporting policy' on
page 106, including the identification of stakeholders and the
definition of material matters. The choices made by the
Managing Board regarding the scope of the sustainability
information and the reporting policy are summarized in the
section 'Non-financial reporting policy' of the Integrated
Annual Report.
The Managing Board is also responsible for such internal
control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation
of the Sustainability Information that is free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
The Supervisory Board is, amongst other things, responsible
for overseeing Royal DSM's sustainability reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the Sustainability
Information
Our responsibility is to plan and perform the assurance
engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and
appropriate assurance evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute,
level of assurance, which means we may not have detected
all material errors and fraud.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or errors and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of
users taken on the basis of the Sustainability Information. The
materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit
procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified
misstatements on our opinion.
We apply the 'Nadere voorschriften
kwaliteitssystemen' (Regulations on quality management
systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system
of quality control including documented policies and
procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements,
professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.
We have exercised professional judgement and have
maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  236 www.dsm.comaccordance with the Dutch Standard 3810N, ethical
requirements and independence requirements.
Our audit engagement included among others:
- Performing an analysis of the external environment and
obtaining an understanding of relevant social themes and
issues, and the characteristics of Royal DSM;
- Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria
used, their consistent application and related disclosures in
the Sustainability Information. This includes the evaluation
of the results of the stakeholders' dialogue and the
reasonableness of estimates made by management;
- Obtaining an understanding of the systems and processes
for collecting, reporting and consolidating the sustainability
information, including obtaining an understanding of internal
control relevant to our audit, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Royal DSM's
internal control;
- Evaluating the procedures performed by the internal audit
department;
- Identifying and assessing the risks if the Sustainability
Information is misleading or unbalanced, or contains
material misstatements, whether due to errors or fraud.
Designing and performing further audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion. The risk that the sustainability information is
misleading or unbalanced, or the risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for
one resulting from errors. Fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control. These further procedures include
among others:
-Interviewing management and relevant staff at corporate,
business and local entity level responsible for the
sustainability strategy, policy and results;
- Interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the
information for, carrying out internal control procedures
on, and consolidating the data in the sustainability
information;
-Determining the nature and extent of the audit procedures
for the group components and locations. For this, the
nature, extent and/or risk profile of these components are
decisive. Based thereon we selected the components
and locations to visit. The visits and remote reviews to 7
production sites in 6 countries are aimed at, on a local
level, validating source data and evaluating the design,
implementation and operation of controls and validation
procedures;
- Obtaining assurance information that the sustainability
information reconciles with underlying records of the
company;- Evaluating relevant internal and external documentation,
on a test basis, to determine the reliability of the
information in the sustainability information; and
- Performing an analytical review of the data and trends.
- Reconciling the relevant financial information with the
financial statements;
- Evaluating the consistency of the sustainability information
with the information in the annual report which is not
included in the scope of our audit;
-Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of
the sustainability information;
- To consider whether the sustainability information as a
whole, including the disclosures, reflects the purpose of the
reporting criteria used.
We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding,
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant findings, including any significant findings
in internal control that we identify during our audit.

Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  237 www.dsm.comSpecial statutory rights
DSM Preference Shares Foundation
The DSM Preference Shares Foundation was established in
1989.
By virtue of DSM's Articles of Association, 375,000,000
cumulative preference shares B can be issued. The listing
prospectus of 1989 stated that if, without the approval of the
Managing Board and Supervisory Board, either a bid is made
for the ordinary shares or a significant participation in ordinary
shares is built up, or such an event is likely to occur, then these
preference shares B may be issued, which shall have the same
voting rights as the ordinary shares.
Under an agreement entered into in 1999, and subsequently
amended, between the DSM Preference Shares Foundation
and DSM, the Foundation has the right to acquire such
preference shares (call option) to a maximum corresponding
to 100% of the capital issued in any form other than preference
shares B, less one.
The objective of the Foundation is to promote the interest of
DSM, and the enterprise maintained by DSM and all parties
connected therewith, whereby influences that would threaten
the continuity, independence or identity, contrary to the
aforementioned interests, are resisted to the maximum extent
possible.
The purpose of the agreement with the Foundation is, among
other things, for the Foundation to allow DSM the opportunity
to determine its position, for example with regard to a possible
bidder for DSM shares or a party or parties tempting to obtain
(de facto) control, to examine any plans in detail and, to the
extent applicable, to look for (better) alternatives. Preference
shares B will not be outstanding longer than necessary. As
soon as there are no longer any reasons for the preference
shares B to remain outstanding, the Managing Board will
convene a General Meeting of Shareholders and recommend
the cancellation of the preference shares B that are still
outstanding.
The Foundation acquired no preference shares B in 2018.
The DSM Preference Shares Foundation is an independent
legal entity within the meaning of article 5:71, first paragraph,
under c of the Dutch Act on Financial Supervision (Wet op het
financieel toezicht).In 2018 board member Mick den Boogert was replaced by
Bas Kortmann. Mick passed away in August 2018. With his
extensive knowledge of business law, he was a highly
respected and valued board member. We thank him for his
contribution, over many years, to the Foundation.
On 31 December 2018, the board of the Foundation was
composed as follows:
Gerard Kleisterlee, Chair 
Cees Maas, Deputy Chair 
Bas Kortmann

Eubiotics
The general term 'Eubiotics', is related to the Greek term
'Eubiosis' and relates to feed ingredients that support an
optimal balance of microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract of
livestock animals. They promote efficient gut performance so
as to produce well-nourished animals that get the most from
their feed, while at the same time sustaining their health and
welfare and protecting the environment.
Frequency Index (FI)
The Frequency Index is a way to measure safety performance.
The number of accidents of a particular category per 100
employees per year.
Inclusion Index
The Inclusion Index is a subset of items in the Employee
Engagement (Pulse) Survey to specifically measure Inclusion.
Inclusion is: "A working environment where all employees are
a full and equal member of a team; where  diverse perspectives
are valued, and investment is made in their development;
where people are respected and able to contribute as they are
and not having to conform; where they can reach their
potential, and where they can speak up without fear of
retribution."
LWC-rate DSM own
The Lost Workday Case (LWC)-rate DSM own is the number
of lost workday cases per 100 DSM employees in the past 12
months: 
LWC-rate = 100 * (number of LWCs (past 12 months) /
average effective manpower (past 12 months)).
Lives Reached
Lives Reached is a measure of consumers already reached
through consumer products of third parties containing DSM
products and solutions. This measure addresses key end-
markets representing approximately 25% of DSM's total sales.
In this first version of Lives Reached, these end markets are in
Human Nutrition & Health and Personal Care, with the other
businesses currently considered out of scope. These will be
added over time.
The number of Lives Reached is calculated for each market
separately and then aggregated. As a business-to-business
company, our products reach end-consumers via third
parties, so calculations per market are performed at global
level. Consumer touch points are assumed to be unrelated,
and overlap is eliminated using statistical methods (DeMorgan's Law and Probability Theory – Independence). The
actual overlap may be larger or smaller than calculated based
on this assumption.
Key assumptions are used to perform these calculations and
include DSM's market share, total consumer markets, share
of wallet and consumer consumption behavior. These
assumptions are made based on external market data where
available, supplemented with market and business intelligence
insights.
For more information on Lives Reached, see the company
website.
Occupational Health Case
This refers to any abnormal condition or disorder requiring
medical treatment – other than one resulting directly from an
accident – caused by, or mainly caused by, repeated exposure
to work-related factors.
PSI rate
The PSI rate is the number of Process Safety Incidents per 100
DSM employees and contractor employees in the past 12
months: PSI rate = 100 * (number of PSIs (past 12 months) /
average effective manpower including contractor employees
(past 12 months)).
REC-rate DSM all
The REC-rate DSM all is the number of recordable injuries per
100 DSM employees and contractor employees in the past 12
months: REC-rate  = 100 * (number of RECs (past 12 months) /
average effective manpower including contractor employees
(past 12 months)).
Safety, Health and Environment (SHE)
DSM's policy is to maintain business activities and produce
products that do not adversely affect safety or health, and that
fit with the concept of sustainable development. The company
does this by setting the following objectives: to provide an
injury-free and incident-free workplace; to prevent all work-
related disabilities or health problems; to control and minimize
the risks associated with DSM's products for their whole life
cycle and to choose production processes and products such
that the use of raw materials and energy is minimized; to
evaluate and improve DSM's practices, processes and
products continuously in order to make them safe and
acceptable to its employees, the customers, the public and
the environment.
United Nations Global Compact

United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights
On 10 December 1948, the General Assembly of the United
Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. Following this historic act, the Assembly called
upon all Member countries to publicize the text of the
Declaration and "to cause it to be disseminated, displayed,
read and expounded principally in schools and other
educational institutions, without distinction based on the
political status of countries or territories."
PLANET
Biofuel
A fuel which is derived from renewable organic resources, as
distinct from one which is derived from non-renewable
resources such as crude oil and natural gas.
Brighter Living Solutions
Brighter Living Solutions (BLS) are products and services that,
when considered over the product life cycle, offer an
environmental benefit (ECO+) and/or a social benefit
(People+) compared to mainstream reference solutions.
ECO+ qualifications are made based on comparative Eco Life
Cycle Assessment (LCA). DSM is using the standard approach
to evaluate environmental footprint as published by the
WBCSD Chemical sector in 2014. Qualifications are also
made based on documented expert opinion by business
managers or relevant internal experts based on identified
mainstream reference solutions and identified environmental
differentiators.
The People+ qualifications are made based on DSM People
LCA method or expert opinions, similar as for ECO+. The
People LCA method helps to identify social impacts of
products on the dimensions health, comfort and well-being,
working conditions, and community development. This
methodology is developed by DSM based on internal
standards and external stakeholder dialogues.
More information and definitions can be found on the company
website.
Carbon footprint
The total set of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions
expressed as CO 2eq.
Carbon price
The price that is paid to emit one ton CO 2eq into the
atmosphere. DSM implements an internal carbon price of
€ 50/t CO 2eq.Circular economy
Circular economy refers to an economy that is restorative and
in which materials flows are of two types: biological nutrients,
designed to re-enter the biosphere safely, and technical
nutrients, which are designed to circulate at high quality
without entering the biosphere throughout their entire lifecycle.
CO2
Carbon dioxide, a gas that naturally occurs in the atmosphere.
It is part of the natural carbon cycle through photosynthesis
and respiration. It is also generated as a by-product of
combustion. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
COD is an indicator of the degree of pollution of waste water
by organic substances.
Eco-efficiency
Eco-efficiency is a concept (created in 1992 by the WBCSD)
that refers to the creation of more goods and services while
using less resources and creating less waste and pollution
throughout their entire life cycle. In the context of DSM's SHE
targets, eco-efficiency relates specifically to the reduction of
emissions and energy and water consumption, relative to the
production volumes of DSM's plants.
Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE)
Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions 
Direct GHG emissions occur from sources that are owned or
controlled by the company (i.e. emissions from combustion in
owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc.).
Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions
Indirect GHG emissions relate to the generation of purchased
energy (i.e. electricity, heat or cooling) consumed by the
company. Purchased energy is defined as energy that is
purchased or otherwise brought into the organizational
boundary of the company. Scope 2 emissions physically occur
at the facility where the energy is generated.
Scope 3: Value chain emissions
Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included in
scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting
company, including both upstream and downstream
emissions.
Location-based emissions 
Reflects the average GHG emissions intensity of grids on
which electricity consumption occurs (using mostly national
grid-average emission factor data). Corresponding emission
factor: in most cases, the country emission factor.
Market-based emissions 
Reflects GHG emissions from electricity supplies that
companies have purposely chosen (or their lack of choice) and
contracted. Corresponding emission factors:Explanation of some concepts and ratios
Bright Science. Brighter Living. 2018  243 www.dsm.com- Supplier specific emission factor (provided by the supplier)
- Residual emission factor (country-based grid factor,
corrected for allocated purchased electricity from renewable
resources)
Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) efficiency improvement
The GHGE efficiency improvement is the amount of GHG
emissions per unit of output (specific emissions) in a given year
compared to the specific emissions in the prior year. GHGE
efficiency improvements are one of the ratios in the Long-Term
Incentive part of the Managing Board remuneration and relate
to a three-year period.
GRI
The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) has developed
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines that strive to increase the
transparency and accountability of economic, environmental,
and social performance. The GRI was established in 1997 in
partnership with the UN Environment Programme. It is an
international, multi-stakeholder and independent institution
whose mission is to develop and disseminate globally
applicable Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. These
Guidelines are for voluntary use by organizations for reporting
on the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of
their activities, products and services.

fossil fuels and causes acidification.VOC
Volatile organic compounds. The term covers a wide range of
chemical compounds, such as organic solvents, some of
which can be harmful.
Water use and water consumption
Water use includes water used for 'once-through cooling' that
is returned to the original water source after use. Water
consumption is the portion of water used that is not returned
to the original water source after being withdrawn.
PROFIT
General
In calculating financial profitability ratios, use is made of the
average of the opening and closing values of balance sheet
items in the year under review.
The financial indicators per ordinary share are calculated on
the basis of the average number of ordinary shares
outstanding (average daily number). In calculating
Shareholders' equity per ordinary share, however, the number
of shares outstanding at year-end is used.
In calculating the figures per ordinary share and the 'net profit
as a percentage of average Shareholders' equity available to
holders of ordinary shares', the amounts available to the
holders of cumulative preference shares are deducted from
the profits and from Shareholders' equity.
Adjusted net operating free cash flow
