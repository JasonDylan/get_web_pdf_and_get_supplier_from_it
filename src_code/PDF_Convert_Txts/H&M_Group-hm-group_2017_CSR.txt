CO 2 emissions. We are working to further improve the calculations by using primary data from our main suppliers. The water footprint is based on the Water Footprint Network’s methodology and includes green, blue and grey water footprints. Deviation from 100% due

IMPACTS ALONG OUR VALUE CHAIN
Our vast network of value chain con -
nections means that our social, envi -
ronmental and economic impacts are significant and far-reaching. Therefore, 
to maintain our business idea, we need 
to maximise the positive impacts and minimise the negative impacts we have 
along our value chain. We achieve this 
by using our size and scale to leverage and catalyse changes that improve the 
operation of our own value chain as well 
as the wider industry.  
Please see the illustrations below for a  
more in-depth look at the impacts we have 
along our value chain. Please also visit

ABOUT H&M GROUP / OUR VALUE CHAIN / LETTER FROM CEO / EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
We believe sustainable fashion and design should 
be available to everyone, not only to a privileged 
few. Since my grandfather founded the company  
70 years ago we have had a long-term perspective. 
To secure future business it is essential and natu -
ral for us to address sustainability proactively.  
We are dedicated to continue making great fash -
ion and design affordable, by having a circular 
approach and being a fair and equal company.
 
Thanks to our size and to our committed  colleagues, H&M group is fit to lead the change 
towards a more sustainable fashion future. How -
ever, this is not a task that we can manage on our 
own; collaboration, new-ways of working and joint 
industry goals are key for accelerating the changes 
and results needed. Our continued commitment to the United Nations Global Compact and our 
ongoing collaborative work with stakeholders, 
including local and global experts and NGOs, are a few examples of how we work to achieve positive change through shared responsibility.

While our strong vision and 
ambitions help set the direction of our 
sustainability strategy, it is our Change-
Making Programme that really turns this strategy into action. 
As H&M group is comprised of multiple brands, 
operating in a variety of functions across many 
different countries and cultures, we need a 
programme that systematically and effectively integrates sustainability into all aspects of our 
business. Our Change-Making Programme is our 
solution. 
The programme brings together the goals, road -
maps, standards and follow-up methods we need 
to work towards our vision, while leaving room for 
locally-tailored implementation and activities. This approach helps us make sustainability a relevant 
part of all our colleagues’ daily working lives.
                CULTURE AND VALUESWe turn our vision and strategy into action by working with: 
GOALS
Our vision and  
ambitions are trans-
lated into concrete 
goals at group, market

Reporting directly to our CEO, our

the implementation of our sustainability 
vision and strategy together with the Executive Management Team. Twice  
a year, our CEO, CFO and Head of Sus -
tainability review the progress made  and report performance (against key  
sustainability indicators) to our Board  of Directors.
Our global sustainability department 
consists of more than 30 experts respon -
sible for setting strategies, targets, goals, policies and follow-up procedures to ensure that our sustainability work is 
carried out systematically.In our 20 production markets, we employ 
more than 150 people working specifi -
cally in sustainability. These colleagues work directly with our business partners to assess their performance against 
our Sustainability Commitment (which 
replaced our Code of Conduct in 2016 – 
read more on page 82) and support them 
in making improvements through capac -
ity building programmes and activities.
Each function within each sales market 
then additionally sets its own measur -

sales market, we employ a dedicated 
sustainability manager who drives the implementation of our strategy across 
the entire market to engage all colleagues 
and customers.VISION & STRATEGY
As our Change-Making Programme illustrates, to drive long-
term change throughout our entire value chain, it is crucial 
that sustainability play an active role in the daily work of all our 
colleagues and across every function within H&M group.

How have H&M group’s new sustainability 
vision and strategy been received since their launch last year? 
I think our new sustainability strategy 
has been well received. As it was devel -
oped with the support and guidance of 
leading industry experts with a great 
knowledge of the current sustainability landscape, we believe that it resonates 
with many key challenges and opportu -
nities that face the fashion industry.
Since the launch, our focus has been 
on the long-term implementation of the strategy across the entire H&M group. 
But alongside our work towards achiev -
ing our key long-term goals, we are also 
continuously adding short-term goals 
and milestones to really help drive our 
vision and ambitions forward. 
What are the biggest challenges to  
fulfilling your goals? 
The main challenges we face are not 
specific to H&M group, they are indus -
try-wide. Therefore, solutions cannot 
be reached by us alone – they all require 
industry collaboration. For example, our goal to become 100% fair and equal is 
very much dependent on industry collab -
oration. While we are seeing good pro -
gress with industrial relations and wage systems through our work with ACT  innovation. Finding innovations to fill 
the technological gaps we have through -
out our supply chain and bringing these new innovations to market fast enough are two of our biggest challenges. 
What are the three main priorities  
going forward?
Accelerating the move towards full  
circularity is one of our main priori -
ties. Here our focus is on the continued 
quest for more recycled and sustainably 
sourced materials, improved design, pro -
duction processes and product lifespan. 
Innovation will be key to achieving our 
100% circular ambition.
On the social side, our main priorities 
are to deliver the goals we set for 2018. Looking beyond this, we will focus on 
maintaining the stability of our produc -
tion markets to ensure the provision of 
good, fair opportunities for workers. Our 
third priority is to further develop cus -
tomer engagement around sustainability. 
We will, for example, continue our com -
mitment to the SAC  and the Higg Index , 
as well as exploring other solutions.
H&M group is one of the world’s leading 
design companies and to many, associated with fast fashion. Can a fast fashion com -
pany ever really be sustainable?  I don’t believe that providing fashion on a large scale and working in a sustainble 
way needs to be a contradiction. Like 
many other industries, there are inherent challenges, but for truly systemic change 
to take place, industry-wide collabora -
tion is essential. At H&M group, we are 
positive that by working to achieve a 
100% circular and renewable value chain, 
that treats people in a fair and equal way and makes it possible for our customers 
to make more sustainable choices, we 
can lead the way to this systemic change and provide truly sustainable fashion to 
all our customers around the world. 
Is H&M group afraid to fail?
We are, of course aware that our strat -
egy is very ambitious and the solutions 
needed to achieve some of our goals are 
simply not in place yet. However, a com -
pany of our scale and reach has a respon -
sibility as well as a great opportunity to lead the change towards a more sus -
tainable industry. The evidence is clear: 
our planet is running out of natural 
resources and our population is growing 
exponentially so we must be bold and ambitious in our work. Of course, there 
is always the risk of some failures along 
the way, but I would rather fail having pushed the boundaries as far as possible 
than having only done what’s expected.VISION & STRATEGYOUR VISION & STRATEGY / OUR AMBITIONS / OUR CHANGE-MAKING PROGRAMME / ENGAGING OUR CHANGEMAKERS / HOW WE ARE ORGANISED / INTERVIEW WITH HEAD OF SUSTAINABILITY

100% Leading the Change is our 
commitment to act as a catalyst for 
change across the entire fashion 
industry. By bringing partners together to identify challenges and share 
innovative ideas and solutions, we 
want to push boundaries and break new ground to improve the way our 
products are designed and made.
This leadership approach is core to our strategy 
and will empower us to fulfil our ambitions to 
become both a 100% Circular & Renewable and a 100% Fair & Equal business. 
To lead the change across our own operations and 
those of the industry, we are working to catalyse

can and will be overcome through new innovation. 
For example, there is currently no viable technology 
for recycling blended fibres on a large scale, there -
fore, we simply cannot make new products from as 
many old products as we would like to. But we are 
working with experts who are developing technol -
ogies to tackle this and when a scalable solution 
comes to fruition, it will transform the way the entire 
industry works with materials. 
At H&M group, we are working to identify, invest in 
and promote all types of sustainable innovations from digital systems that provide traceability information 
to new energy-saving solutions. We want to use our 
size and global reach to take sustainable innovations to scale because for us, innovation means transfor -

What is H&M CO:LAB?H&M CO:LAB is a business area within 
The Laboratory. The Laboratory is a 
think-tank within H&M group that works to take an outside-in perspective on 
our business and challenge our think -
ing. H&M CO:LAB invests in companies 
that can add value to our business. We 
look to help these companies thrive 
and reach their vision. H&M CO:LAB invests in three areas: sustainable fash -
ion – that develop the technologies the 
industry needs to become fully circular and sustainable, innovative business 
models – companies that explore how 
consumers will shop fashion in the 
future and enablers  – companies that 
provide technology and solutions that makes us better. By investing in these types of companies, we support the 
long-term growth of H&M group.
How does H&M CO:LAB decide what  
projects to invest in?
H&M CO:LAB only invests when we think we can make a big difference for 
the companies we invest in with our 
knowledge and resources, and always in collaboration with the existing business.   By doing this we learn and challenge 
ourselves in a way that, besides provid -
ingthe opportunity for financial return, 
can improve and develop our business 
in a positive way. 
Which projects are H&M CO:LAB 
currently supporting?
We currently support around ten

The Global Change Award, initiated by the  
non-profit H&M Foundation in 2015, is one of 
the world’s biggest challenges for early stage 
innovation, calling for ideas that will help pro -
tect the planet by accelerating the shift from 
a linear to a circular fashion industry.
Every year, a panel of international experts 
helps to select five winning innovations, 
and the global public distributes a €1 million grant between the winners through an 
online vote. The winners also gain access to 
a one-year innovation accelerator provided by H&M Foundation, Accenture and KTH 
Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, 
offering tailor-made support to further develop their innovations. 
“Now in its third year, the Global Change 
Award has really become a positive force 
in the fashion industry. It has proven to be 
a true catalyst for the winners, giving them support and access to a valuable network 
so they can bring their innovations to the

At H&M group, we believe that greater 
transparency will help lead the change 
towards a more sustainable industry and 
therefore, we are working with transpar -
ency in two key ways:
–  We share information in a 
   transparent way.
–  We collaborate on industry-wide  
transparency tools.
1) WE SHARE INFORMATION IN  
A TRANSPARENT WAYIn 2013, we were one of the first fashion 
retailers to make our supplier list cus -
tomer-facing. Our supplier list includes 
tier 1 manufacturing supplier factories 
for 98.5% of H&M group products. As a Transparency
of 2016, it also includes tier 2 factories 
which account for 60% of our products. 
We are working towards greater trans -
parency across our tier 2 and tier 3 sup -
pliers as well, however, the challenge lies in the fact that in most instances neither 
we nor our competitors have a direct business relationship with those tier 2 
and tier 3 suppliers.
In spite of these challenges, we believe 
that we can do more. We want our cus -
tomers to have faith in the operations we 
run and the products we create, so we are 
working to build transparency layers into 
our brands that go beyond our supplier list i.e. sharing more than business name 
and address details.100% LEADING THE CHANGE
Transparency is key to building trust and credibility along 
our supply chain and empowering our business partners and 
customers to make more sustainable choices. Transparency 
means knowing how and where our products are made and sharing that information wherever possible. As such, supply chain 
transparency creates greater accountability for both ourselves 
and our business partners, allowing us to pinpoint priorities, set better goals, take smarter actions and communicate confidently 
about our progress.  An example of the tiers in a supply chain

ARKET work with  
transparency?
With transparency as a core pillar of its 
business model, ARKET is taking an industry 
lead with a new and innovative way of  
making supplier information customer-  
facing. Using a simple search function, customers visiting the ARKET website, are 
immediately provided with the option to select and buy products based upon the 
products’ country of origin. As such, the tier 
1 supplier details of each individual ARKET 
product are presented to the customer 
directly alongside the product itself. Details listed include supplier name and produc -
tion unit. Selected products also provide customers with supplier stories, giving them an in-depth look at the facility responsible for making the product. Not only does this 
level of transparency increase awareness 
amongst our customers, it also provides suppliers with recognition for their contri -
bution to the brand’s products.           2017 PROGRESS & LEARNINGS

• In 2017, we trialled a new type of 
customer-facing transparency for our 
H&M Conscious Exclusive Collection on

materials were used and who made them.
This feature will be offered again for the 2018 Conscious Exclusive Collection. 
• In 2017, we launched ARKET, the

ble Apparel Coalition (SAC) as a founding 
member. The SAC is an industry-wide 
alliance between brands and stakehold -
ers who are all working towards a more 
transparent and therefore sustainable 
fashion industry. 
Since its inception, the SAC has been 
focusing on the ground-breaking devel -
opment of the Higg Index , a measure -
ment tool which assesses sustainability performance. Using self-assessment and verification tools, the Higg Index meas -
ures the environmental, social and/or 
labour impacts that are associated with  
a brand, a facility (i.e. a factory) or a product and generates a holistic score. 
This score adds comparability and 
enables areas for improvement to be readily identified and addressed.
The Higg Index is an industry first – it is 
currently the only assessment tool that 
provides transparency information of this nature and detail and H&M group 
were one of the first global fashion com -
panies to implement it. The facility mod -
ule was applied to all our tier 1 suppliers in 2015. We also began using the assess -
ment tool on tier 2 factories in 2015. The brand module of the Higg Index 
is currently used internally while the 
product module is still in development.

performance of a single product within

We ensure that all our colleagues are 
encouraged to contribute to our sus -
tainability work and we seek to reward 
them for doing so. We implement and 
measure sustainability goals at every 
level and across all functions within H&M group and crucially, this includes 
goals set at an executive level. Sustain -
ability goals are included in our overall 
management evaluation process and we 
regularly follow up on function specific 
goals. Through a range of activities and strategies, we encourage colleagues to 
contribute to change in the workplace 
and in their communities. 100% LEADING THE CHANGERewarding sustainable actions
We believe that it is important to encourage and empower 
sustainable actions throughout our value chain. We know that 
incentives and reward systems help to achieve long-term, positive 
behavioural changes. Therefore, we want to work with reward systems that engage our changemakers and accelerate progress 
towards our sustainability vision. To encourage colleagues to take an 
active role in our sustainability vision, the 
H&M UK & Ireland management team 
runs a garment collecting competition across all UK & Ireland stores every quar -
ter. As such, store teams compete against each other to see who can collect the 
biggest volume of unwanted garments 
through the in-store H&M, garment col -
lecting scheme. The winning store is then 
selected, announced and rewarded with 
a trip to visit the I:CO recycling facility in Germany. Not only does the competition 
help H&M group work towards its goal to 
collect 25,000 tonnes of unwanted tex -
tiles each year by 2025, it also provides 
colleagues with a deep understanding 
of how garment recycling works and 
why it is so impor -
tant. Colleagues can then return to their stores with a greater 
understanding of how 
we work with I:CO and a greater belief in our 
sustainability work. 
Rewarding colleagues in this way has proven to be very successful 
in the UK & Ireland 
– it builds loyalty, pride and trust while 
increasing knowledge

abundance of natural resources. 
However global demands are rapidly 
outstripping supply. If population growth continues as expected, the volume of 
clothes sold across the world will triple to 
160 million tonnes by 2050.* This level of demand would require the equivalent 
of 2.3 planets’ worth of resources.** Put 
simply, the fashion industry is running out of the natural resources it uses to 
make products and cannot continue to 
operate in the same way. At H&M group, we believe that an industry-wide shift 
from a linear to a circular business  
model is the only solution.
Circular models maximise resources and minimise 
waste. Using the current linear model, less than 
1% of material used to produce clothes across the 
industry is recycled into new products.*** But in a circular model, resources stay in use for as long 
as possible before being regenerated into new 
products and materials, resulting in a reduction in waste and negative impacts. Our 100% Circular & Renewable 
ambition represents our commitment 
to achieve the shift from a linear to a circular model. We are approaching this ambition holistically by building 
circularity into every stage of our value 
chain, including the products we design and make, the materials and processes 
we use and how our customers care for 
and dispose of our products. 
But a business model can only be truly 
circular if it is powered by renewable energy. As such, we are working to use 
100% renewable energy throughout 
our own operations, which will signifi -
cantly reduce our climate impact. 
Beyond switching to renewable energy 
and cutting our emissions, we also 
want to set an example in our own 
operations, drive change along our 
entire value chain and lead our indus -
try towards positive transformation. 
Our goal is therefore to achieve a 
climate positive value chain – a value 
chain that creates a net positive impact on the climate by 2040. 100% Circular & Renewable explained

Making the shift from a linear to a circular model is 
not only necessary for the planet, it also presents a 
strong business case. Once customers are finished 
with products, 87% of the material fibres used by the industry to create those products end up in landfill. 
This represents a lost opportunity of more than 
USD 100 billion every year.* 
By designing for circularity, maximising resource 
use by working with recycled or other sustainably sourced materials, prolonging product lifespan 
and creating a climate positive value chain, we will 
increase the efficiency and the value of our opera -
tions and products. This responsible production and 
consumption will enable us to continue designing 
and producing great, sustainable products while 
creating positive social and environmental impacts. 
To become 100% circular, we are focusing on five key 
stages within our value chain that are applicable to 
both commerical and non-commerical products:A. Design, B. Material choice, 
C. Production processes, D. Product use, 
E. Product reuse and recycling.

circular design involves finding ways to expand 
product lifespan, creating greater durability and 
greater opportunities for rewear, reuse and recy -
cling. Similarly, by taking a circular approach to the way in which we design our stores, we can increase 
operational efficiency and longevity.
CIRCULAR GARMENT DESIGN
Every brand within H&M group has its own teams 
of designers and buyers. They are trained in how to design for circularity and therefore how to choose 
the best possible materials – those that are recycled 
and sustainably sourced, and suited to longevity, reuse and recyclability.A. Design
          2017 PROGRESS 
          & LEARNINGS CIRCULAR GARMENT DESIGN
• In 2017, we upgraded our online 
sustainable materials training course. 
This resource helps H&M group 
designers select the best material from the outset.
 
• Throughout our brands, we now 
take a “component first” design approach, meaning that our designs 
are initially based on material choice. As such, we are building circularity 
into the design process by accounting 
for longevity, durability and the recy -
cling capabilities of our products.
• In 2017, H&M created its sixth annual 
Conscious Exclusive collection with 
all products made from at least 50% 
sustainably-sourced material. In 2017, 
a new recycled material called 
Bionic®– made from shoreline waste – was introduced to customers.  
In this years 2018 collection H&M  
has worked with a material called Econcyl®, a 100% - regenerated nylon 
fibre made from fishingnets and other 
nylon waste.100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLEDesign offers the first 
opportunity for circularity 
to enter our value chain. 
By incorporating circular 
thinking at this stage, we can pave the 
way for later stages to follow suit.The longevity of garments has been an 
integral part of the COS design ethos 
since the brand began ten years ago. 
Founded on the principles of timeless, functional and considered design, 
COS has an in-house pattern studio 
and team comprised of twenty-five experienced pattern cutters that work 
to create the collections.
Many COS pieces are created using 
a special design process in which the patternmaker and designer work in 
parallel. The pattern teams develop 
each garment from a block and experi -ment with clever construction tech-niques to maximise the use of fabric 
while minimising excess; this approach 
was highlighted in the 10
th anniversary 
collection in March 2017. The pattern 
team also combine both modern and 
traditional tailoring techniques such as French seams, double turned hems 
and structured interlining to ensure the 
longevity and durability of the garment. 
This way of designing reduces waste, 
ensures longevity and contributes to H&M group’s work towards becoming 
100% circular, without compromising 
on style or brand aesthetic.Case study: Designing for longevity at COS

As well as product design, we are also looking at ways in which we can work 
with a circular approach when designing 
our stores. Not only will this increase our operational efficiency, it will also 
increase the longevity of our stores. 
Together with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation , we have developed a tool  
to assess the circularity of our non- commercial goods, which includes our store interiors (for H&M to begin with). 
In 2016, we set a goal that at least 80% of 
these store concepts should be circular by 2025.* 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE

• In 2017, we started using the Ellen 
MacArther Foundation tool with H&M.  
So far, it has had a good impact on the 
sustainability of our non-commercial goods. The tool also improves how we 
communicate with our suppliers and 
raises awareness of the need for circular -
ity in their products and processes.   KEY FACTS & FIGURES / KPI s AND GOALS / 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE EXPLAINED / BECOMING 100% CIRCULAR  / BECOMING CLIMATE POSITIVE
What is the Circular Fibres Initiative  and how is H&M group involved?
The Circular Fibres Initiative  brings 
together key industry stakeholders to 
create a circular economy for textiles. In 
November 2017, the initiative published a 
report, ‘A New Textiles Economy, Rede -
signing Fashion’s Future’ , which outlined 
for the first time a positive vision for a textiles system that works – one that is aligned with the principles of a circu -
lar economy. We are now shaping the second phase of the initiative, which will 
over three years mobilise key industry 
players and other stakeholders behind the report’s recommendations. As a Core 
Partner of the initiative, H&M group acts 
as an industry pioneer in the transition to a circular economy.  
Why is a move towards a circular  
textile economy so important?The fashion industry is incredibly waste -
ful: every second, the equivalent of one garbage truck of clothing is burned or landfilled. An estimated USD 500 billion 
of value is lost every year due to clothing 
being barely worn and rarely recycled. The industry is also polluting: washing our 
clothes releases every year the equivalent 
of more than 50 billion plastic bottles worth of microfibres, which eventually 
end up in the ocean. Yet, in this wasteful 
and polluting model lies a golden oppor -
tunity to do things better by moving to 
a circular economy for textiles. In such 
an economy clothes are designed to last longer and be worn more, be resold and recycled, and not release toxins or pollute 
the environment.
What does the industry need to  
focus on to drive the changes towards  
a circular textile economy?In our report, we highlighted four ambi -
tions for a new textiles economy: (1) phase out substances of concern and microfibre release; (2) increase clothing utilisation; (3) 
radically improve recycling; and (4) make 
effective use of resources and move to renewable inputs.
To achieve these ambitions, the industry 
will need to focus on exploring new mate -
rials, pioneering business models that 
capture the value of more durable clothes, 
designing clothes that are compatible 
with recycling technologies and setting up a system in which fabrics are used over and over again. We are now calling on the 
entire industry to rally behind the vision, 
raise the ambition level and explore new ways of working together to build a new 
textiles economy.

By choosing to work with more recycled or other 
sustainably-sourced materials, we can reduce the 
negative impacts of material production in our 
value chain. Recycled materials are a win-win: they stop waste material going to landfill and reduce 
the use of virgin raw materials (as well as the 
chemicals, energy and water used to make them). 
Likewise, bio-based, sustainably-sourced materials 
are naturally grown or cultivated, recycleable and typically less polluting.*
We evaluate the sustainability credentials of recy -
cled and sustainably sourced materials by using 
third-party verified life cycle assessment data such 
as the MadeBy fibre benchmark and the Higg Index  
(specifically the Material Sustainability Index 
within the Higg).**B. Material choice
*Not all sustainably-sourced materials can be naturally grown or cultivated i.e. minerals or stones. In these instances, we set up material- 
specific policies such as the use of external standard schemes to secure sustainable sourcing. **H&M group uses materials that are certified according to relevant material standards including OCS, GOTS, GRS, RCS, RDS, RWS. They are then verified by third parties such as  
Control Union, Ecocert, ICEA, IMO. To ensure that we are able to inte -
grate recycled and sustainably- 
sourced materials into our value 
chain as rapidly and successfully as possible, we are collaborating with 
industry experts. We are, for exam -
ple, collaborating with the Cradle to 
Cradle Products Innovation Insti -
tute on an initiative called Fashion+ . 
By bringing brands, designers and suppliers together, the initiative seeks 
to identify, optimise and innovate 
sustainable materials while making them widely available. 
Similarly, we are working, on a long-
term strategzic basis, with the Ellen 
MacArthur Foundation and Stock -
holm Resilience Centre  in a research 
project to explore ways in which the circular textile fibre industry can 
successfully operate within planetary boundaries. 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLEOur goal is to use

The challenge we face, however, is 
that viable recycling solutions for many types of textile fibres – espe -
cially blended fibres – have either not been invented yet or are not commer -

To tackle this, we are creating 
demand for these solutions and work -

          2017 PROGRESS 
          & LEARNINGS RECYCLED MATERIALS
• In 2017, 35% of the materials used 
by H&M group included recycled or 
other sustainably-sourced materials.
• In 2017, we used the equivalent of 
over 100 million plastic PET bottles  
in recycled polyester.
• In 2017, H&M launched its first  
garments made from recycled  
shoreline waste. Named Bionic®  
the new material was featured within the annual H&M Conscious Exclusive 
collection. In the 2018 collection, H&M has worked with a new material called 
Econcyl® – a 100% regenerated nylon 
fibre made from fishingnets and  
nylon waste.
 
• For spring/summer 2017, Weekday 
debuted its first sustainable swim -
wear collection made from recycled 
waste. Garments were created using recycled polyamide, which includes 
everything from old fishing nets to 
carpets, and recycled polyester  
created from old PET bottles.100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLERecycled materials

Swedish innovation company re:newcell, 
whose unique technology recycles used 
cotton, viscose and other cellulosic fibres into a new, more sustainable dissolving 
pulp that can be turned into new textile 
fibres. 
• This year, H&M group joined DEMETO, 
a new research project focusing on recycling polyester textiles into new 
fibres without compromising quality. The 
project is partly funded by the EU and other partners.*
• In 2017, H&M collaborated with Danone 
AQUA on a project called Bottle2Fashion 
in Indonesia. Through this collaboration, 
Danone collects and recycles plastic waste which is then sent to H&M group 
suppliers where it is turned into recycled 
polyester, made into products and sold in 
H&M stores.Case study:  
H&M Foundation 
invests in HKRITA
During the last few decades, the com -
position of fibres in clothes has become 
increasingly complex. This makes 
recycling blended fabrics incredibly difficult. To address this, H&M Foundation 
partnered with the Hong Kong Research 
Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA) in 2016. With an estimated funding of 
€5.8 million the aim was to find at least 
one ready technology to recycle clothes 
made from blended textiles.
Only a year into the partnership, HKRITA 
found a chemical process to fully sep -
arate and recycle cotton and polyester 
blends into new fibres. The hydrothermal 
process uses only heat, water and less 
than 5 percent of a biodegradable green chemical to self-separate cotton and pol -
yester blends. This fibre-to-fibre recycling method is cost effective and there’s no secondary pollution to the environment, 
ensuring the life of the recycled material 
is prolonged in a sustainable way. “By being able to upcycle used textiles into 
new high value textiles, we no longer need to solely rely on virgin materials to dress a growing world population. This 
is a major breakthrough in the pursuit of a fashion industry operating within the 
planetary boundaries,” says Edwin Keh, 
Chief Executive Officer of HKRITA.
The new technology will be tested fur -
ther before being made available to the 
global fashion industry. H&M Foundation 
want their work to benefit as much of the 
environment and as many people and communities as possible, so when the 
technology is finalized, it will be licensed 
widely to ensure broad industry access 
and maximum impact.

• In 2017, we made significant progress 
towards ensuring that our supply chain 
is free of ancient and endangered forest 
fibres. However, as with transforming any global supply chain, it doesn’t happen 
overnight and additional work with  Canopy and our supply chain partners is 
needed to reach our target of zero tolerance 
for ancient and endangered forest fibres.
• As of October 2017, producers represent -
ing 70% of global viscose production have CanopyStyle policies in place that commit to 
end sourcing from ancient and endangered forests, require free, prior and informed con-

invest in innovative solutions.
• As of October 2017, 25% of the MMC 
fabric supply chain (including rayon, viscose, 
lyocell and modal) has been audited and 
classified as low risk for sourcing wood from ancient and endangered forests or other 
controversial sources. This is a result of the 
CanopyStyle Audits – a third-party verifica -

CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT
Chemicals are used in many processes involved 
in garment production. At H&M group, we have 
always worked with one of the most advanced chemical restrictions lists  in the industry to ensure 
that our products are safe for both people and the environment. But we are always working to further develop our chemical management and therefore 
in 2017 we launched a new chemical vision and 
roadmap . 
Our new vision is to lead the change towards safe products and a toxic-free fashion future and our new chemicals roadmap helps to identify exactly 
how we plan to achieve this. The roadmap points to C. Sustainable production
three key working areas: toxic-free, 
safe products and leading the change. 
For us toxic-free means that the 
chemicals used to make our prod -
ucts and across our supplier facto -
ries, should never represent a threat to people or the environment. To achieve this, we are continuing to 
work towards our goal of zero dis -
charge of hazardous chemicals in 
our own supply chain and across the 
fashion industry. 
Similarly, safe products are those that 
do not cause any harm to people or 
the environment. We work actively to ensure the safety of our products by 
continuously evaluating new scien -
tific knowledge and data. 
Finally, we want to lead the change by 
not only minimising, but eliminating 
the impact of harmful chemicals and 
we want to do this in a transparent way. We have therefore set a new goal 
to have 100% traceability of input 
chemicals by 2030.100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLESustainable production 
processes are an important

to reduce negative water impacts throughout our value chain for over ten years. 
United in a common vision for better availability 
and quality of freshwater, H&M group began a 
long-term partnership with WWF in 2011. Our 
goal is to become a leading water steward within the fashion industry and with the help of WWF, we 
have developed a 5-step water stewardship strategy 
to achieve this (see adjacent illustration).
OUR WATER STEWARDSHIP STRATEGY
In contrast to conventional approaches to moni -
toring water footprint and efficiency, which tend 
to focus simply on how much water is used and 
disposed of, our stewardship strategy takes an  integrated approach and goes beyond the factory 
lines to take the whole supply chain into account. 
This approach therefore factors in the water 
sources that are being drained (which accelerates 
water scarcity and decreases water quality) and addresses local impacts such as depletion of fish 
stocks and threat to livelihoods.100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLEWater managementKEY FACTS & FIGURES / KPI s AND GOALS / 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE EXPLAINED / BECOMING 100% CIRCULAR  / BECOMING CLIMATE POSITIVE
Our 5-step strategy
1. WATER AWARENESS 
Building water awareness at our company, at our sup -
pliers’ factories and amongst our customers to ensure 
high level understanding of the global water challenges and their dependence on freshwater.
2.KNOWLEDGE OF IMPACT 
Measuring water impact and risk within our stores, warehouses and suppliers’ factories.
3.INTERNAL ACTION 
Improving the use of water within our stores, ware -
houses and our suppliers’ factories.
4.STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
Increased focus on collective action with other com -
panies, governments and NGOs in multi-stakeholder platforms to address water issues in specific focus regions.
5.INFLUENCE GOVERNMENTS
Increased focus on government influence by engaging with public policymakers to manage water basins in a sustainable way.1

Product use
By designing products with longevity and durabil -
ity, empowering our customers to care for products 
in a sustainable way and providing opportunities 
for customers to recycle with us, we can prolong the lifespan of our products and create a truly circular 
economy. 
CUSTOMER USE
We encourage all our customers to make sustain -
able choices while using and disposing of our products. There are several ways we go about this, 
including providing information about garment 
care, encouraging customers to use products for as long as possible and offering opportunities for 
reuse and recycling, rather than disposal.
For example, our garments have the Clevercare  
label included in their washing instructions. This encourages washing at lower temper -
atures and hang drying instead of 
tumble drying. Simple behavioural changes like this can dramatically 
reduce the environmental impact 
of our products after they leave our store, as well as increasing their over -
all lifespan.100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLEWe know that products 
with a long lifespan have a 
less negative impact on the 
environment. We also know 
that the largest part of a products life 
is spent with its owner. Therefore, we 
need to ensure that we create products that can be used for as long as possible 
and that we give our customers the 
tools to help enable this.  KEY FACTS & FIGURES / KPI s AND GOALS / 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE EXPLAINED / BECOMING 100% CIRCULAR  / BECOMING CLIMATE POSITIVE

We are continuously working 
to increase the number of 
our products that are reused 
or recycled. At the core of 
our strategy is our garment collection 
initiative through which we collect 
unwanted clothes from our customers and give them a new life, through reuse, 
rewear or recycling. In 2016, we set a 
new goal to collect 25,000 tonnes of unwanted clothes annually by 2020. In 
2017, we collected over 17,000 tonnes. 
Garment collection is easy, accessible and works for 
our customers and our business. We started collect -
ing unwanted textiles (from any brand, in any con -
dition) in H&M stores in 2011. In 2013, we rolled out 
the initiative globally. This service is now also offered 
by all & Other Stories stores, Monki stores and selected Weekday stores. & Other Stories also collect 
and recycle beauty product containers in store. 
To run our garment collecting scheme, we partner 
with I:CO  – a solutions provider for textile sorting. 
Once in the hands of I:CO, all unwanted textiles are 
sorted to either be reused/reworn or recycled. 60% 
of textiles are reused/reworn; 34% are recycled and 
6% are used as combustibles for energy production 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLEKEY FACTS & FIGURES / KPI s AND GOALS / 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE EXPLAINED / BECOMING 100% CIRCULAR  / BECOMING CLIMATE POSITIVE
with 0% of textiles going to landfill. Part of the recyclable post-consumer 
waste collected with I:CO is then used 
to create new products in both regular and special collections that are sold 
across H&M group brands. We are constantly working to 
increase the share of textile-to-textile 
recycled materials in our products. 
As new innovation and recycling technologies develop, we will be able 
to create more products from the 
post-consumer waste we collect via E. Product reuse & recycling

OUR OWN OPERATIONS
Our waste management currently focuses 
on two categories: faulty products and store and warehouse waste. To ensure 
that we operate in a truly circular way, 
we always aim to reuse or recycle both types of waste with zero going to landfill. 
FAULTY PRODUCTS
The safety of our customers is always 
paramount, therefore we will only ever 
sell products if we know that they are entirely fit for purpose. If any of our 
products fail our strict quality and 
safety requirements or appear faulty or 
damaged, they cannot be sold. Faulty 
products are of course never intended and we are always working to improve 
our design and production processes. 
But when faulty products do occur, it is crucial that we handle them in the most 
sustainable way possible.
While faulty products, damaged, samples 
or stopped-orders cannot be sold in our 
stores, they are still fit for use. In these instances we send these products for 
reuse or recycling. We partner with char -
ity organisations and reuse/recycling 
companies on a local market level and 
with larger partners to ensure that zero 
percent goes to landfill.There are, however, rare instances when 
we create products that we cannot sell 
because they are unsafe for use. These may be, for example products that have failed certain chemical safety tests or 
that have been contaminated by mould 
during transportation. Unsafe products cannot be reused and depending on 
how unsafe the product is, it may not 
be possible to recycle it either. In these instances, the only option is to destroy 
these unsafe products. We must stress 
that this is not only an incredibly rare occurrence, it is also an absolute last 
resort. 
STORE & WAREHOUSE WASTE
Within our stores and warehouses we are focusing our efforts on managing 
the most common types of waste – 
cardboard, plastic and paper. In most cases, these materials are collected in 
our stores and then sent to our local 
warehouse facilities where they can be recycled. However, this depends on the 
availability of existing recycling systems 
in the country or region where our stores and warehouses are located and this can 
pose challenges. 
In 2017 the share of stores that had suf -
ficient recycling systems for these types 
of waste equated to 64%. This indicates a 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLEdecrease from last years result (2016: 71%) which can be attributed to improved data collection. 
We have however seen an increase in 
the amount of waste that is recycled at 
our warehouses. In 2017, 92.8% of waste 
originating in our warehouses and waste delivered to our warehouses from stores, 
was recycled compared to 91.8% in 2016. 
Our aim is to recycle 100% of the waste collected in all our stores and warehouses.KEY FACTS & FIGURES / KPI s AND GOALS / 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE EXPLAINED / BECOMING 100% CIRCULAR  / BECOMING CLIMATE POSITIVE

Climate change remains one of the greatest 
challenges of our time. Its consequences will 
affect our entire planet and everyone living on 
it – making it a key challenge for all industries, including fashion. H&M group is determined 
to be part of the solution to climate change. 
By going beyond simply cutting our emissions, we are fully committed to make a significant 
contribution to help our planet stay below the 
2°C global warming limit as set by the Paris Climate Agreement.
H&M group’s goal is to have a climate positive value chain by 
2040, which means removing more emissions from the atmos -
phere than that which we (our value chain) produce. With the help of expert scientific organizations and the WWF Climate 
Savers, we have taken a science-based approach to establish 
three key priorities to help us reach this goal.
Priority 1 focuses on leadership in energy efficiency to enable  
us to use as little energy as possible. Priority 2 tackles our  
100% renewable energy goal which will help us to ensure that 
the energy we use is renewable. Lastly, priority 3 targets climate 
resilience and carbon sinks, to address unavoidable emissions and emissions beyond what our value chain is responsible for.
These three priorities relate to both our own operations and 
those across our value chain.

Leadership in energy efficiency
Different parts of our value chain require different 
approaches to energy efficiency. Similarly, the level 
of control we have over energy efficiency varies 
across our value change i.e. we have greater control over some parts of our value chain than others. But 
regardless of this variability, we are committed to 
increasing energy efficiency across our entire value chain to help reach our 2040 climate positive goal. 
As such, we must work out how to optimise the max -
imum energy output from the smallest, necessary 
energy input at every stage. 
OUR STORES  
With over 4,700 stores, our bricks and mortar 
portfolio accounts for the majority of H&M group’s own electricity consumption. As such, we have 
developed a new goal and a new store energy man -
agement strategy to help reduce our in-store energy 
consumption and reach our 2040 climate-positive 
goal. Originally, our goal was to achieve a 20% 
reduction in electricity intensity (amount of  electricity used per square metre of sales area) by 
2020. We have now increased our goal to a 25% 
reduction in electricity intensity by 2030. We will measure this by taking into account the amount of 
electricity used per square metre of sales area and 
opening hours, with 2016 as a new baseline. As lighting and HVAC (heating, venti -
lation, air-conditioning) accounts for 
90% of the electric energy we use in our 
stores, our new store energy manage -
ment strategy aims to improve the way 
we work with these systems. By putting 
more specific demands on HVAC systems and replacing HID with LED lighting 
systems, we believe that by 2030, every 
store we construct will use 40% less 
energy per square metre and opening 
hour than those we construct today.100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE

our logistics and warehouse teams in our 
sustainability work and raise awareness about the importance of improving our 
energy efficiency. Several concrete ideas 
to decrease energy use were presented by colleagues including, for example, 
how to utilise natural light in a more

          ENERGY EFFICIENCY WITH OUR SUPPLIERS
• We are reducing greenhouse gas emis -
sions at a factory level through supplier 
energy efficiency programmes in Bang -
ladesh, China, India and Turkey. In 2017, 
our improvement programmes resulted 
in savings of 98 million kWh, triple that of 
last year ( 2016: 30 million kWh saving). The programmes have also helped save 
72 million m 3 of natural gas and 0.17 mil -
lion tonnes of coal. Together, this equals 
a reduction of 0.35 million tonnes of 
greenhouse gas emissions.

We are committed to maximising the use 
of renewable and sustainable energy in 
our value chain. We know that by using 
more renewable energy and helping our suppliers and customers do the same, we 
are supporting the transition to fossil-free 
energy use.
OUR OPERATIONS  
We want to source 100% renewable  energy in our own operations. Today, 
96% of our electricity comes from renew -
able sources. We have achieved this 
through various methods, including the 
purchase of Energy Attribute Certificates 
which fulfil the quality criteria set by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance and by 
generating our own renewable electricity.
We will continue to develop our renew-
able energy procurement method to reach 100% renewable energy in our 
own operations. We are also members of

Climate resilience  
& carbon sinks
We are committed to fully eliminating 
greenhouse gas emissions from our own 
operations. However, despite our best 
efforts, we recognise that there will still be unavoidable emissions in our value 
chain. To truly become climate positive, 
we are engaging in activities to absorb emissions both within and beyond our 
direct control.
This involves actively supporting mech -
anisms that reduce existing emissions 
while strengthening climate resilience. 
We need to further develop this approach 
and collaborate with experts to move solutions forward. 
Currently, we are exploring opportuni -
ties in three areas:1. Natural carbon sinks – these are 
nature’s existing mechanisms for absorb -
ing greenhouse gases. This area could include protecting valuable biomass (such as rainforests) or investments in 
more sustainable agriculture.

What are scopes?
According to the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol , emissions can be categorised 
into three groups known as scopes:
Scope 1 emissions:  are defined as 
“direct” emissions the we (H&M group) 
either own or have direct  
control over.
Scope 2 emissions:  are defined as 
“indirect” emissions created from the 
consumption of purchased electricity. 
Purchased electricity is defined as electrcity that is bought or otherwise 
brought into the organisational bound -
ary of the company. 
Scope 3 emissions:  are defined as any 
emissions that are produced outside 
of our own operations and that we 
therefore have indirect control over. 
This includes our suppliers and the producers of raw materials used in our 
products as well as emissions from the 
use of products, for examples when our customers use washing machines 
to wash their clothes.KEY FACTS & FIGURES / KPI s AND GOALS / 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE EXPLAINED / BECOMING 100% CIRCULAR / BECOMING CLIMATE POSITIVEH&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201753 OF 100HOW WE REPORT OVERVIEW STANDARDS & POLICIES VISION & STRATEGY 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE 100% FAIR & EQUAL

The below KPIs and goals represent the initial key milestones along the way to achieving our ambition to become 100% Fair & Equal.H&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201756 OF 100HOW WE REPORT OVERVIEW STANDARDS & POLICIES VISION & STRATEGY 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE 100% FAIR & EQUALOur 100% Fair & Equal ambition has  
two focus areas: 
1.   Fair jobs  
– within H&M group 
– within our supply chain 
2.  Stewards for diversity and  
inclusiveness
A fair job means fair compensation, a safe and healthy workplace, an 
environment free from discrimination and respect for every employee’s voice. 
We also believe that a fair job should 
make every individual feel valued and respected within their workplace. Fair 
jobs are fundamental to the positive 
growth and development of employ -
ees within H&M group and workers 
within our supply chain. Fair jobs are 
also good for business – they make us an attractive employer and an attrac -
tive business partner and that helps 
us maintain stability and productivity 
in the markets in which we operate.100% Fair & Equal explained
Simultaneously, as stewards for diversity and inclusiveness, we believe that we have a respon -
sibility and an opportunity to drive inclusiveness and embrace diversity throughout our business. By protecting every individual’s right to equal 
treatment and ensuring a zero tolerance policy on 
discrimination, we are working towards a more 
open society where everyone is welcome. We also 
recognise that our stewardship extends beyond employees. We are responsible for influencing our 
customers around the world through our products, 
campaigns and messaging.
Ultimately, we believe that through offering fair 
jobs and acting as stewards for diversity and inclu -
siveness, we can make a positive impact on the lives 
of employees within H&M group, workers within 
our supply chain and our customers. Diversity helps foster innovation and the ability to rethink. 
In return, this will make our business more resil -
ient, productive and sustainable.100% FAIR & EQUALAt H&M group, we firmly believe that everyone connected to  
our business should be treated in a fair and equal way. Being 100%

          FAIR JOBS WITHIN H&M GROUP
• In 2017, we re-launched our company 
values across the entire business.
• We launched our Global Health & Safety 
Policy in January 2017, an upgrade to our 
existing Safety Policy that will help estab -
lish a strong health and safety culture 
across our operations. This policy is now 
permanent and relates to all functions 
across the business.
• In 2017, we changed Global Safety Week 
into Global Health & Safety Week in line 
with the launch of our new Group Health 
& Safety Policy. This global and group-
wide initiative helps to contribute to our 
safety culture. 
• Gender pay gap  reporting was intro -
duced by the UK government in April 
2017, meaning all employers with over 
250 employees in the UK are now legally 
required to publish an annual report of their gender pay gap. H&M group UK’s 
first report showed a 3.94% (median) pay 
gap for H&M UK employees. This pay gap is 50% smaller than that of the average 
retailers and businesses in the UK. 4. EQUALITY: We provide a solid  
foundation of fair and attractive working 
conditions. These include fair labour 
standards, health and safety standards, fair and competitive compensation, a 
comprehensive grievance procedure and

While our 100% Fair & Equal ambition 
is relatively new, our work towards 
creating fair jobs within our supply 
chain is not. H&M group started an assessment programme to help 
monitor working conditions in supply 
chain factories back in 1998 which led to improvements in basic health 
and safety, regular employment, legal 
payment of wages and prevention of child labour. 
In 2013, we updated our social 
sustainability strategy to take on a 
more holistic approach that aims to 
create lasting improvements on an industry level. As an integral part of 
our company risk and human rights 
due diligence framework our assess -
ment programme still provides a solid 
foundation for our work. Fair jobs for all: within our supply chain (production)
Today, our core social sustainability 
work is focused on capacity building 
and addressing key human rights 
issues to achieve our ambition of 100% fair jobs within the supply 
chain. Our strategy currently has 
three focus areas:
1. Enabling industrial relations
2. Supporting a fair living wage 3. Respecting human rights100% FAIR & EQUALThe concept of a fair job may sound simple, but in many 
of the production markets in which we operate, poor 
implementation of legislation means that fair jobs are not 
available to all. This creates an industry-wide challenge.  
In collaboration with our business partners, we are working 
towards our ambition to ensure that everyone in our  
supply chain has access to a fair job. KEY FACTS & FIGURES / KPI s AND GOALS / 100% FAIR AND EQUAL EXPLAINED / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL / STEWARDS FOR DIVERSITY & INCLUSIVENESS

Many markets, however, lack sufficient 
systems to make well-functioning indus -
trial relations a reality. Therefore, as part of our strategy to achieve 100% fair 
jobs in our supply chain, we are working 
to improve industrial relations across our industry and in all our production 
markets. This kind of systemic change 
is highly complex and depends on us working to:  
–  give workers a voice 
–   build industry collaborations 
–   engage with local governments
GIVING WORKERS A VOICE  H&M group has a production office (PO) 
team present in almost every country in 
which our products are made. It is their responsibility to help facilitate stronger 
relationships between factory workers 
and factory owners through our varying social dialogue programmes. Enabling industrial relations
For example, through our Workplace Dialogue Programmes, we work directly 
with workers and management to raise 
awareness of their rights and obligations, including the importance of freedom of association and collective bargaining. 
We also help facilitate the democratic 
election of worker representatives. 
Worker representatives can ensure that 
workers voices are truly considered and that managements decisions are truly 
accountable. Being trusted by their fellow 
workers and respected by management enables the worker representatives to 
bridge the gap that often exists between 
the two parties (i.e. workers and manage -
ment). As such, we believe that democrat -
ically-elected worker representatives are a hugely important communication channel and a crucial first step towards enabling 
well-functioning industrial relations.At H&M group, we believe that well-functioning industrial 
relations are crucial to the creation of fair jobs. Good relationships 
between workers and management and effective interactions and 
negotiations on factory, industry and country level, promote good working conditions and better wages. Good labour relations also 
support stability and performance in our production markets.  KEY FACTS & FIGURES / KPI s AND GOALS / 100% FAIR AND EQUAL EXPLAINED / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL / STEWARDS FOR DIVERSITY & INCLUSIVENESS

HR & Compliancewas concern about the ability of workers 
to engage in constructive dialogue and learn about rights and responsibilities. 
How was this overcome?
The trainers and H&M group have been 
very supportive both for management 
and workers to overcome hesitations and establish trust. Providing training and films 
for workers has really helped them gain 
trust. The messages in the training film were very clear for both management and 
workers. They showed how to engage in 
fruitful dialogue, how worker representa -
tives can be elected, how to handle issues 
in meetings and what the benefits can be 
for workers and management. The film was not only shown to all 3,800 workers, 
but also all levels of management including 
supervisors. 
What has been your experience of  
the process so far? Very good experience of all activities so 
far. Also very positive feeling in the factory 
during the days coming up to election. Workers were engaged, excited and 
happy. Satisfaction level and trust level 
towards the management is improving through just this process. We are happy.

What is your experience of the Work -
place Dialogue Programme so far?
All processes were good. The movie for 
workers to raise awareness of rights and how an election works was good.
Why did you decide to stand for  
election? 
I thought I could contribute to the devel -

have an issue they can come to me and I 
can help them bring their voice to man -
agement and help resolve issues where 
there are issues.
What were your thoughts about running

I was a little bit hesitant of what it would 
be like, but I feel trust in the process.We spoke to a worker and a member of the management team at 
one of the supplier factories we work with in Bangladesh to find out

COLLABORATIONS  
We believe that collaboration within  
the industry is essential to establish  
the agreements and strategies needed to  further improve industrial relations. 
One of the key relationships that we have 
built within the industry is with Indus -
triALL  and IF Metall . With these two 
organisations, our Global Framework Agreement  (GFA) works to improve labour 
conditions within our global supply chain with a focus on enabling freedom of asso -
ciation and collective bargaining.
To implement the GFA, National Moni -
toring Committees (NMC) have been  
set up in our production countries. NMCs 
“  The NMC system creates a space for our unions  
not only to develop as responsible social partners  
but also to increase their organizing and collective  
bargaining capacity, which is needed for unions  
to develop and strengthen.” JENNY HOLDCROFT, INDUSTRIALL GLOBAL UNION ASSISTANT GENERAL SECRETARYare composed of local IndustriALL 
affiliated trade union representatives and local H&M group production office 
representatives. The NMCs develop local 
action plans and facilitate conflict reso -
lution. H&M group was also a founding 
member of Action Collaboration Trans -
formation (ACT). ACT is a collaboration 
between international brands, retailers 
and trade unions to address the issue 
of a living wage through industry-wide collective bargaining. Read more about 
our work with ACT on page 64.
ENGAGING WITH LOCAL  
GOVERNMENTS 
Enabling legal and institutional frame -
works are crucial for well-functioning 
industrial relations. Through regular discussions with local governments, 
advocacy work and through our partner -
ship with ILO, we support the develop -
ment of necessary frameworks. Having offices and local staff in each production market is a key strategy and great asset 
when it comes to engaging with local 
governments and other key stakeholders. 
OUR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS GOALS
– To ensure that supplier factories  
producing 50% of H&M group’s product 
volume, have democratically-elected worker 
representation in place by 2018.
– Continue to engage with industry experts 
and governments on indus  trial relations

          INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
• In 2017, factories producing 52% of  
our product volume, implemented demo -

This means we have achieved our  2018 goal.
• 100% of our garment manufacturing 
units in Bangladesh have held democratic

total, 2,882 people were elected of which 40% were women.
• Our industrial relations and workplace 
dialogue programmes, reached 458 factories in 2017 (2016:290, 2015: 132). Our 2017 programmes included factories 
in China, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, 
Indonesia, Turkey, Ethiopia and Myanmar. In total 621,977 workers were reached.
• In October 2017, IndustriALL and repre -

satisfies the basic needs of workers and 
their families as well as providing some 
discretionary income. A fair living wage should be revised annually and negoti -
ated regularly. 
Across the industry, workers are 
employed by factories that produce for 
multiple brands at the same time and therefore, the salary workers receive can -
not be linked to a single brand. In other words, workers are paid the same amount of money by factory owners, regardless of 
a product’s final price tag. 
While H&M group cannot directly decide 
what workers are paid, we believe that 
we can support the creation of fair living wages via our Fair Living Wage Strategy. 
OUR FAIR LIVING WAGE STRATEGY
We developed our global Fair Living 
Wage Strategy in 2013 with guidance 
from multiple experts, trade-unions Supporting a fair living wage
and NGOs. The strategy focuses on governments, factory owners, our own 
purchasing practices and most crucially, 
workers. The strategy is both interlinked with and dependent on well-functioning industrial relations, including collective 
bargaining. Therefore, it is crucial for all 
parties involved to work together for the strategy to really come to life. Here’s how 
it works:
– We engage in dialogue with local 
governments to further develop the legal framework needed for improved indus -
trial relations.
– We engage with factory owners  
to promote the importance of well- functioning industrial relations. We also 
help them implement well-functioning wagemanagement systems by using the  
Fair Wage Method .
– We ensure that we maintain good 
purchasing practices by being long-term, stable business partners, which helps 
factory owners to pay a fair living wage.
– We train workers and management 
about their rights and responsibilities 
and facilitate the democratic election of 
worker representatives through trade unions or worker committees.
To drive our Fair Living Wage Strategy 
forward on an industry level, we collabo -
rate with industry experts, NGOs, unions and other brands through our partner-  
ship with ACT (Action, Collaboration, Transformation). Read more about our work with ACT on page 64.
OUR FAIR LIVING WAGE GOALS 
– Supplier factories representing 50%  
of product volume should be using the Fair 
Wage Method by 2018.
– 90% of business partners should regard 
H&M group as a fair business partner by 2018.100% FAIR & EQUALKEY FACTS & FIGURES / KPI s AND GOALS / 100% FAIR AND EQUAL EXPLAINED / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL / STEWARDS FOR DIVERSITY & INCLUSIVENESS
We believe that all workers should earn a fair living wage and we 
are fully committed to this vision. Consequently, we are improving 
wage practices factory-by-factory while at the same time partnering 
with other brands and trade unions to achieve the systemic changes needed to ensure fair wages across the industry.

• In 2017, we scaled up implementation 
of wage management systems (using 
the Fair Wage Method, FWM) to reach 
a total of 227 factories (2016: 140, 2015: 69). In 2017 Myanmar was also 
included as a new market. This means 
that the FWM is now operating in fac -
tories who supply 40% of our product 
volume, bringing us close to meeting 
our 2018 goal.
• Our annual anonymous supplier sur -
vey, showed that 94% of our suppliers 
consider H&M group as a fair business 
partner, exceeding our goal of 90%.
 
• During 2017, we developed wage 
management system guidelines based 
on the learnings made so far and in 
close consultation with a variety of stakeholders. This will guide the work 
with our business partners going 
forward and has also been shared with industry partners.

Can you briefly describe ACT’s vision  and objectives?
ACT (Action, Collaboration, Transformation) 
brings together global brands, retailers and IndustriALL – the global trade union federation 
representing garment and textile workers  
– to address the issue that in many countries, garment and textile workers do not earn a 
living wage.
We believe that substantial and sustained 
improvement of wages and working condi -
tions in the industry requires collaboration between brands, suppliers, governments and trade unions and, crucially, a change in 
purchasing practices and representation of 
the workers themselves.
We engage with governments, employers  
and workers to encourage industry-wide  
collective bargaining. Coordinated wage-  
setting enables companies to compete on 
quality and innovation without being undercut 
by bad labour practices and poor wages. ACT corporate members are committed to sup -
porting this through responsible purchasing practices that incorporate higher wages.What are ACT’s priorities for 2018?We want to move towards practical imple -
mentation of our vision that global supply chains can be efficient, dynamic and just. We will continue to work with other initiatives 
such as Sweden’s Global Deal  and Germany’s 
Textile Partnership  and international organ -
isations like the ILO  and the OECD  to build 
momentum for the achievement of living 
wages through freedom of association and 
responsible purchasing practices. We are also 
engaging with other brands to gain further 
support for our approach. 
In addition to continuing our conversations in 
Cambodia, Vietnam and Turkey, we are going 
to begin new discussions in Myanmar and Bangladesh. To achieve genuine progress, the 
establishment of a culture of trust, recogni -
tion and collaboration between trade unions 
and manufacturers in the garment-producing countries, as well as between the national 
actors and international buyers, is absolutely 
essential. That culture has to be developed through a patient process of discussion and 
negotiation in which commitments are made 
and kept.Case study: Interview with Frank Hoffer

towards this and its collective effort 
has resulted in substantial progress in several key markets.   
• ACT has been recognised in the G20

Child labour and children’s rights are identified 
as salient human rights issues. H&M group does 
not accept any form of child labour and as a result of our strong and long-term position on the issue 
of child labour, it is exceptionally rare to find any 
workers below the statutory minimum age in our business partners factories. 
We make it an absolute, minimum requirement 
for all factories producing for H&M group to be 
free from child labour and this compliance is 
continuously monitored. During 2017 we identi -
fied one case of child labour.
If we find any person below the minimum age 
working in any of our business partners factories, 
then our Child Labour Policy guides us (and our 
business partners) to act in the best interests of the child. This can include ensuring that the 
individual enrols in school, providing compensa -
tion to the family for lost income and partnering 
with civil society organisations. Read more infor -
mation on our policies at sustainability.hm.comRespecting human rights
The safety and wellbeing of factory workers is of the utmost importance 
to H&M group. It is imperative that all the suppliers (business partners) 
we work with provide safe conditions for their workers and failure to do 
so is a failure to respect human rights.   100% FAIR & EQUALADDRESSING FORCED LABOUR
Forced labour is identified as a sali -
ent human rights issue that poses a potential risk throughout our value chain. As with our approach to child 
labour, it is an absolute minimum 
requirement for all factories produc -
ing for H&M group to be free from 
forced labour and this compliance is 
continuously monitored. 
We have several risk assessment 
processes to ensure that we iden -
tify and address any risks of forced 
labour. Our ongoing work to address 
the specific risks of forced labour 
is described in our Modern Slavery 
Statement  which is published each 
financial year alongside our annual

• During 2017, we continued to  
conduct internal training and capacity 
building to address modern slavery

CHILD LABOUR
 • We have identified a risk of child labour 
linked to mica*. In line with our strategy on 
mica, we have held training courses with 
cosmetic suppliers to raise awareness on the risks connected to exposure to mica. 
In cooperation with suppliers, we are also 
systematically gathering further informa -
tion to increase the traceability of mica in 
our products.
• In 2017, we participated in the general 
assembly annual meeting of the Responsi -

participated in various working groups.
• In 2017, we continued to collaborate with 
the Centre for Child Rights and Corporate Social Responsibility  (CCR CSR) in a project 
to prevent child labour and protect young

mittee since day one. The Bangladesh Accord is now monitoring over 1,600 factories.
The initial aim was to transfer the 
Accord to a local national regulatory 
body by May 2018. However, transfer 
of the Accord is dependent on the local 
body demonstrating the full capacity to 
inspect factories, protect workers,  provide transparency and provide  
confidential complaints mechanisms. 
Readiness for this transfer will be agreed 
by the Accord committee which includes 
brands (including H&M group), global unions, the ILO , the Bangladesh  
Garment Manufacturers Association  and the Bangladeshi government.100% FAIR & EQUAL          2017 PROGRESS & LEARNINGS
          SOCIAL SECURITY
• In 2017, we continued our work to 
address social security issues, specifically 
failures to issue work permits and the 
unwarranted use of short-term contracts.
• In 2016, we engaged with the labour 
rights organisation Solidarity Centre  to 
develop a training plan to increase aware -
ness of legal contract rights for Cambodian workers. In 2017, we held workshops with a 
broad range of stakeholders, including our 
suppliers, trade unions, Better Factories Cambodia  and the Cambodian government 
to raise awareness about the advantages of undetermined duration contracts (UDCs).
• In 2017, we acted on issues relating to 
both social security and working condi -
tions in Turkey. We continued to engage with the government, UN organisations, 
NGOs, other brands and business associ -
ations to further improve refugees’ access 
to work permits. 
• Through capacity building and collabo -
ration with various stakeholders, H&M is 
enabling formal employment of Syrian ref -
ugees in our supplier factories. As of 2017, 
more than 250 refugees are employed in 
our approved units in Turkey, supported by 
the United Work program .ADDRESSING SOCIAL SECURITY
In most developed countries, perma -
nent forms of employment often entitle 
employees to social security benefits i.e. healthcare, sick pay, work-related injury 
cover and maternity leave etc. Employ -
ment schemes in many developing coun -
tries, however, do not always entitle their workers to the same kind of protection. 
In some instances, the schemes can in fact limit the workers ability to exercise 
their worker’s rights. At H&M group, we 
work to ensure that these limitations are minimised by addressing the employ -
ment schemes offered by suppliers (our business partners) to their workers. 
We ensure that suppliers/factory own -
ers are aware of their obligations under 
labour and social security laws and that 
these obligations are being met. We 
then look to identify instances in which 
social security obligations are being 
systematically avoided. For example, the continued use of short-term contracts 
rather than the opportunity for full-time 
employment can enable suppliers to avoid making provisions for higher levels 
of protection.          2017 PROGRESS & LEARNINGS
          THE BANGLADESH ACCORD
• In 2017, the national government of

June 2017, H&M group signed the, newly named “ Transition Accord .” The Accord 
will continue its current operations and remediation programme until local regula -
tory bodies have the full capacity to take 
over. The Transition Accord will remain in 
operation until May 2021. 
• By November 2017, 90% of original

on intercultural communication, I learned so 
much more about my buddy and the whole group. I did not expect that we could actually 
make a big difference with this programme 
but we really did. In my case, I talked to my store manager and we developed a three-
day internship at our store for my buddy. 
This setup did not exist before and it can now be used for other newcomers to get an idea of what our job looks like at H&M. This makes me very happy and proud.
Why would you recommend the  
programme to other colleagues?
You get to know a lot of interesting new 
people and cultures and, of course, it is a 
lot of fun. It is also good for your net -
working: you meet many colleagues from 
different stores with different roles, but 
you also meet many people from totally different countries and cultures who can 
share their experiences with you. I would 
never have met all these different people 
in my private life.Case study: Integration programmes at H&M
At H&M group, we always work to foster an inclusive workplace and 
welcome an exchange of skills, so in 2017 H&M launched a series of 
integration programmes. Rolled out in Italy, Sweden and Germany, the 
aim of the programmes was to provide refugees in each of the three H&M markets, with a chance to settle into a new society, build social 
networks and gain training and work experience to help them secure a 
job in the future. Here, we meet a few of the programmes participants:KEY FACTS & FIGURES / KPI s AND GOALS / 100% FAIR AND EQUAL EXPLAINED / FAIR JOBS FOR ALL / STEWARDS FOR DIVERSITY & INCLUSIVENESS

• During September 2017, Weekday  
celebrated Zeitgeist, its long-standing 
print project, by launching re-editions  
of some of the most popular prints. 
Zeitgeist is a weekly in-store print project 
that reflects on current events in popu -
lar culture, society and politics. Limited 
numbers of prints are available and sold

collection covered topics such as social media addiction, women’s rights, self-
love/acceptance, mental health and 
gender equality. 
• During 2017, Monki launched an 
exclusive menstrual cup together with 
the brand Lunette. The cup, which was 
available to buy in store and online, was also accompanied by a strong cam -
paign which formed part of the brand’s 
ongoing work to empower women and 
end the stigma that exists around peri -
ods. Together with Lunette, Monki also 
donated 5,000 menstrual cups to The 
Cup Foundation . The Cup Foundation is 
a non-profit organisation that works to 
support underprivileged girls around the 
world by providing them with sustainable menstrual cups and education on sexual -
ity and reproductive rights. 
• In March 2017, H&M launched the UNI-
denim collection featuring six denim 
garments made to be worn by all custom -
ers regardless of gender. The collection 
featured jackets, jeans and shorts available 
in extra small, small, medium, large or extra 
large sizes rather than the traditional female or male denim sizing. The collection was 
accompanied by an advertising campaign 
which featured male and female models wearing exactly the same outfits.
• In spring 2017, Monki released the  
#No  Filter campaign – a campaign featur -

with humanitarian agency CARE  called 
Foundation 500. With reference to the 
famous Fortune 500 list, the Foundation  
500 is a list of successful female business leaders from emerging markets. 
“The entrepreneur is the hero of our 
time, and it is estimated that over the 
coming years over one billion women will 
enter the workforce – a majority through 
entrepreneurship. But you can’t be what you can’t see. With the Foundation 500 
list, we want to re-define what a business 
leader looks like ,” said Diana Amini, Global 
Manager, H&M Foundation.
All 500 women in the campaign are part 
of a programme set up by H&M Foun -
dation and CARE to provide women in developing countries with economic empowerment. The idea of the campaign 
was to challenge stereotypes and inspire 
other women to develop their own  
businesses.

We divide our standards into three  different categories: 
– our own operations
– our business partners – our materials/products.
Above these standards rests our human

This chapter will illustrate the way in 
which our standards and policies are 
implemented throughout our value

compliance and progression.Our standards and policies help us ensure that we are staying on

or opportunity within our value chain, 
there are many different ways that we 
can address this. One way, is to cre -
ate a set of standards and policies to 
help guide our work. Creating tailored 
strategies allows us to follow-up on the implementation of standards and pol -
icies and assess their effectiveness and impact. Although we use different follow up methods for different standards and 
policies, we always apply three clearly 
defined processes that help us to ensure we work with the correct standards and 
policies for the given need, risk or 
opportunity:
– We identify 
– We address
– We report & evaluate
1) WE IDENTIFY
We look at our key long-term sustain -
ability needs and we conduct in-depth 
assessments to enable identification 
of both opportunities and risks. This 
type of identification involves regular in-depth checks of our own operations 
and our business partners’ operations. 
There are three focus areas that require particular due diligence:Human rightsOngoing human rights due diligence is key to ensuring that we meet our 
responsibility to respect human rights 
throughout the value chain. We contin -
uously work to ensure human rights are 
an integral part of all relevant processes. 
Our human rights due diligence pro -
cesses act to identify risks and impacts 
and adequately address them. 
Environment
Assessments on water, chemicals, cli -
mate change, biodiversity and animal 
welfare are conducted on a daily basis 
as part of our basic risk management 
operations.  
Corruption
Our risk assessments for corruption focus on levels of risk defined by; coun -
try, industry and position/function. Once the level of risk is ascertained, we set 
short and long-term goals to help miti -
gate the risk. We annually map the big -
gest risks for corruption in our organisa -
tion based on a combination of our own 
assessments and experience and those of external sources such as the Maplecroft 
Country Risk Tool and the Transparency 
International Perception Index . We then 
use the results of these assessments to 
identify high-risk countries and allocate Working with standards & policies
our resources in the best way. We apply 
a zero tolerance policy when it comes to corruption and within our Code of 
Ethics, we have a strong anti-corruption 
programme in place which enables us to take a proactive approach towards 
preventing corruption.
2) WE ADDRESS 
Once a need, risk or opportunity is 
identified, we work according to a clear framework to mitigate and remediate 
it. We then either follow the framework 
prescribed by an existing standard or policy relating to the identified need, risk STANDARDS & POLICIESor opportunity, or we look to create a new and more suitable standard or policy. 
3) WE REPORT & EVALUATE
We regularly follow-up on all actions 
taken to address needs, risks and oppor -
tunities. This follow-up then provides 
us with a base for further strengthening 
and improving our programmes. We 
report findings, progress and impacts to relevant stakeholders, within and out -
side of our company, through continuous dialogues as well as through our public communication channels and reports.

Respect for human rights is a fundamental part of any successful 
business. As stated in our human rights policy, we work to 
integrate our respect for human rights across all our operations 
and relevant activities. This means that we need to understand the risks and impacts on human rights and seek ways to prevent, 
mitigate and remediate these risks and impacts. Hence, we apply 
human rights due diligence and continuously conduct internal training to put our human rights policy into practice and to embed 
respect for human rights in everything we do.Our human rights policy
HUMAN RIGHTS DUE DILIGENCE
We use human rights due diligence 
as an ongoing process to monitor the 
practice of and respect for, human rights throughout H&M group. Our human 
rights due diligence is conducted system -
atically as an integral part of all relevant 
assessment processes including, for 
example, risk management processes, 
business partner due diligence, stake -
holder engagement, grievance handling 
and all internal training. Each of these 
assessment processes contains a clear component that enables us to iden -
tify, address and report on any risks or impacts that relate to human rights. 
HUMAN RIGHTS MANAGEMENT
Our human rights due diligence serves  
as the basis for our human rights  
management.
The main processes and activities con -
nected to our human rights management 
include:
•  Identifying and addressing salient 
human rights issues.STANDARDS & POLICIES•  Annual sustainability risk assessments, 
conducted by all functions within the

TRAINING
Through ongoing in-depth training, we raise 
awareness and competence in human rights issues 
throughout our business. While training is custom -
ised for different functions and roles, all training 
covers a basic introduction to human rights, out -
line our responsibilities as per the UNGPs , explains 
how we work with human rights due diligence and how we address situations that may have a human 
rights impact. We prioritise training for key posi -
tions and roles, such as sustainability managers 
in our production markets, country managers in 
our sales markets, and relevant business functions such as sustainability, HR and legal.
INCIDENT MANAGEMENT
Specific policies and standards are in place to help 
prevent human rights impacts from occurring. But within the course of our business activities, situa -
tions may still arise in which human rights impacts do occur and which go beyond what is dealt with through our Sustainability Commitment (previ -
ously called Code of Conduct). In these situations, we respond with our incident management routine. This involves a systematic approach to analysing 
our responsibility according to the UNGPs and 
applying appropriate measures. We make sure to integrate what we learn from analysing each situa -
tion into our practices going forward.            2017 PROGRESS  
           & LEARNINGS
HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY
• In 2017, we collaborated with Shift  
to conduct a training programme for 
our sustainability managers working in 
some of our key production markets. The training focused on analysing 
the likelihood and severity of human 
rights risks as well as the impacts these risks have in the given market. 
Taking issues raised by global and 
local stakeholders, as well as the polit -
ical and cultural landscape of the mar -
ket into account, the training helped identify priority issues and define 
ways to address them. The training 
also fed into our goal setting process by helping us identify challenges that 
we need to create goals for and work 
towards in the coming year. 
• In 2017, the annual review of our 
salient human rights issues was con -
ducted and confirmed the continued relevance of the issues identified. Read more in How we report on

(FOR H&M GROUP EMPLOYEES)
At H&M group, we make it a rule to always 
act with integrity. To make our expect-ations clear to our employees and business 
partners, we have a Code of Ethics (CoE), 
which often goes beyond the strictest regu -
lations and legislation in our markets.
It includes a no-gift policy and zero toler -
ance on bribery and corruption. We also 
cover conflict of interest, company assets 
and confidential information. Our CoE is the same around the world and is trans -
lated into all languages spoken at H&M group. It secures our position and clarifies 
the expectations we have of employees 
when doing business on our behalf. 
It is mandatory for our Board of Direc -
tors, senior executives, all employees in 
contact with business partners, in-house 
consultants and staff from employment 
agencies (and similar) to sign our CoE. We also make it mandatory for employees who 
sign the CoE to undergo online training on 
the CoE. The training provides a deeper understanding of the CoE, including how 
it relates to daily work and how it helps 
employees know how to act when repre -
senting H&M group in a business context. 
In addition to our online training, we also 
provide a three-hour dilemma workshop which involves hands-on practical exam -
ples of ethical dilemmas that managers, HR and purchasing staff could encounter. 
Several functions within H&M group,  
such as security, IT and expansion, 
conduct internal audits of their depart -
ment routines and policies and these 
audits include analysis of how the CoE is 
being implemented in the organisation. Random samples are also carried out on 
specifically risky markets or positions. 
We follow up on reported incidents of  
CoE breaches thoroughly. If a violation  
is reported, the security department  
will start an investigation. Anyone who 
deliberately violates the CoE will receive a warning and can, in seri  ous cases, lose 
their employment. We also have a whis -
tleblowing procedure in place whereby 
potential breaches can be reported con -
fidentially, anonymously and without  any risk of reprisal.
Every six months, the Head of Security 
reports the number of breaches and the progress of these cases, to the Board. 
Annually we also disclose the number 
of cases in our annual report and in our stand-alone sustainability report. We also 
use the history of the cases for our annual 
risk mapping. Policies within our own operations

H&M group must help our customers and 
colleagues feel safe. Our 2017 goal for 
the global store audit - which consists of safety, loss prevention and information 
security – is 85% compliance. In 2017, 
we completed 9,905 store audits and achieved 86% compliance. The safety  
area result of the global store audit was 
88% compliance across all stores and brands. We have identified employee 
training as the area with most oppor -
tunity to improve our compliance rates. 
Training our employees includes how to 
work safely, prevent losses and comply 
with local legal safety training demands 
and we are working with HR to improve 
this further.
WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY
We have a whistleblowing procedure in place so that potential breaches can be 
reported by H&M group employees confi -
dentially, anonymously and without any 
risk of reprisal. 
GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICIES
H&M group is present in many markets 
around the world. We are rapidly expand -
ing and recruiting new employees every 
day. Our success depends on our people.Our social policies, such as our global policy on diversity, inclusiveness and 
equality and our global non-discrimina -
tion and harassment policy, are founded 
on our respect for human rights and on 
UN and ILO conventions, amongst oth -
ers. They set our minimum expectations 
and complement our company values. 
These policies contain clear directions 
that help managers and employees to meet daily business needs, understand 
how to work and act towards business 
partners and create fair and equal working conditions in safe and healthy 
workplaces. Our global policies set the 
minimum standard regardless of local 
legislation where we operate. Whatever 
gives the greatest protection for all col -
leagues is always the guiding principle.
TAX POLICY
H&M group works in accordance with 
the tax laws and regulations set by each 
and every country that our business operates in. Our tax policy reflects and 
supports our compliance as a business.

• In October 2017, we launched a new 
Sustainable Workplace Strategy (SWS) 
which is required in every H&M group 
workplace. The standard states a mini -
mum level of sustainability requirements 
to ensure that our colleagues are working 
in sustainably-functioning workplaces. The SWS also encourages an aspirational 
level of performance which encourages 
colleagues to make tailored sustainable adaptations to their workplaces.
• In 2017, we started working with a new 
food policy to help support the launch  
of our first commercial food projects –  
The ARKET café and the H&M It’s Pleat restaurant. The policy helps the organ -
isation to purchase food that has been sourced in a sustainable way from both 
an environmental, social and animal  
welfare perspective.
• In 2017, we investigated and closed  
41 incidents* of potential non-compliance with the Code of Ethics (2016: 39,  
2015: 33, 2014: 30). These investigations 
led to terminations or written warnings

partners must sign and comply with our 
policies. Two of our most crucial policies are our Code of Ethics and our Sustaina -
bility Commitment .
CODE OF ETHICS  
(FOR OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS)We set an expectation of mutual trust and transparency in all our business 
relationships. Our Code of Ethics (CoE) 
for business partners underpins this, as does building awareness, providing edu -
cation and maintaining a no-gift policy.
Business partners include any busi -
ness that supplies us with goods and/or 
services, acts on behalf of our business 
or has a collaboration with us. Business 
partners include suppliers (commercial and non-commerical), vendors, consult -
ants, landlords, agents, service providers and organisations. To date, 100% of our commercial goods suppliers – our biggest 
group of business partners – have signed 
our CoE.  
Any kind of bribery (including facilita -
tion payments) will always be addressed 
and may lead to the termination of our 
business relationship. By taking a firm 
line on refusing to accept any kind of contribution or bribery, we aim to encourage others in our markets to share our values. We are focusing on high-risk

We launched our Sustainability Commitment 
(SC) on 1 February 2016. It replaced our Code of 
Conduct, which had been in place since 1997. The SC outlines the basic requirements we place on 
business partners of H&M group. Moreover, it also 
communicates an aspirational level of performance we want all our business partners to aspire to. The 
aspirational level demonstrates where we want to 
go in the long term. Through empowering our busi -
ness partners and promoting constant improve -
ment, we want to give our partners the opportunity to use their initiative to further their sustainability credentials. In our performance evaluation, we will 
reward business partners that commit to and meet 
their aspirations.
The SC is shared by all brands within H&M group 
and it is mandatory for all our commercial business 
partners to sign it if they want to start or continue 
working with us. The SC summarises the areas we are working on to make our supply chain more 
sustainable as well as describing how we work with 
our business partners to create progress in these areas. The three major focus areas of the SC are 
healthy workplaces, healthy ecosystems and animal 
welfare. 
We want to grow with those business partners who 
share our values and who are willing to work trans -
parently with us. We believe that our SC will help 
to improve our collective social and environmental 
performance. STANDARDS & POLICIESKEY FACTS & FIGURES / STANDARDS & POLICIES EXPLAINED / WORKING WITH STANDARDS & POLICIES / OUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY / POLICIES WITHIN OUR OWN OPERATIONS / POLICIES FOR OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS  / PRODUCTS & MATERIALS POLICIES

How do we assess our  
business partners perfor -
mance & compliance?
SIPP is our Sustainable Impact Part -
nership Programme. It is with SIPP 
that we assess the level of compliance 
with the Sustainability Commitment (SC) and it is how we measure our busi -
ness partners’ performance and drive constant improvements. We started 
using SIPP in 2015 to support our busi -
ness partners to become more envi -
ronmentally and socially sustainable.   SIPP is only applied on our commercial 
business suppliers (those providing goods that we sell). SIPP consists of five 
major components: minimum require -
ments, self-reporting, validation, capac -
ity building and case handling. 
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
Before starting any working rela -
tionship with a business partner, we 
conduct a ‘minimum requirement 
assessment’, which we carry out on site. All business partners must pass the 
assessment to begin working with H&M 
group. (See Becoming an H&M group business partner illustration on page 
81). In 2017, we performed 1,736 mini -
mum requirements assessments across 
tier 1 and tier 2 business partners.SELF-REPORTINGWe want our business partners to take 
ownership of their sustainability perfor -
mance because we believe it is the best 
way to achieve long-lasting and sustain-
able change. Therefore, once our busi -
ness partners have passed the initial, 
‘minimum requirement assessment’ we 
then enable our partners to self-assess 
their own sustainability performance 
annually. We encourage our business 
partners to set their own goals, priorities and focus areas. We then work with our 
partners to identify areas where H&M 
group can best provide support through capacity-building workshops, training 
and management systems analysis. We 
also build connections between our sup -
pliers and other functions at our produc -
tion offices, such as our merchandising and quality departments. We use these connections to encourage our suppliers to develop their own strategies and solu -
tions to challenges, as well as providing incentives to shift impacts from neg -
ative to positive ones. This consistent 
presence helps us build long-term and 
mutually- rewarding partnerships.
The self-reporting component of SIPP is 
closely linked with SAC’s  facility module 
(Higg) . We were one of the first brands 
to incorporate the Higg facility modules (both environmental and social) into our supply chain. The main advantage of the 
Higg facility scores is that all brands can 
use them, so business partners only need to complete one assessment rather than several brand-specific ones. This makes 
factory assessments fairer and more 
comparable, regardless of the brand.STANDARDS & POLICIESKEY FACTS & FIGURES / STANDARDS & POLICIES EXPLAINED / WORKING WITH STANDARDS & POLICIES / OUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY / POLICIES WITHIN OUR OWN OPERATIONS / POLICIES FOR OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS  / PRODUCTS & MATERIALS POLICIES

VALIDATION
Our business partners self-report 
through SIPP and we validate the result. 
We assess every business partner’s capacity to manage their sustainability 
issues and to track their performance 
using environmental and social sustain -
ability metrics. Our Sustainability Index 
(SI) is created as a result of our SIPP 
assessment process. We give every fac -
tory we work with an SI score of between 
zero and 100, which is based on the Higg 
facility module and our own criteria.
The overall performance and country 
risk assessments, amongst other indi -
cators, helps to determine the level of validation that is needed for each factory. For all high-risk and new commercial 
business partners, we perform an onsite 
check at least once a year. If the business partner is low risk (e.g. they achieved a 
high score on the audit), a desktop vali -
dation is usually sufficient. This involves 
checking data and paperwork for anoma -
lies and inconsistencies. 
To encourage our suppliers to improve 
their sustainability performance, we 
reward those who set ambitious goals and maintain good performance. 
Rewards include long-term business 
commitments and growth opportunities. CAPACITY BUILDING 
Using the validated assessments, we 
are able to see our business partners strengths and weaknesses in sustaina -
bility performance. Business partners 
are then asked to set their own goals 
and take actions to strengthen their capacity to better manage sustainability 
matters themselves. H&M group capacity 
building programmes serve as platforms through which we can support our busi -
ness partners in different focus areas.
CASE HANDLING 
If H&M group receives input that a prob -
lem or incident linked to a supplier has occurred, our sustainability team will 
log the case and investigate. Cases cover a broad range of issues that may affect 
a business partner from an issue in a 
specific facility to a regional natural dis -
aster. If a case of minimum requirement 
non-compliance by a supplier is con -
firmed, a Letter of Concern is sent to the 
supplier. Depending on the number and 
kind of violation, different consequences 
will be applied by H&M group. 
In such cases, a corrective action plan 
must be submitted and approved by H&M group before any further business 
is conducted. The underlying idea is to 
apply a long-term strategy where we eval -uate if the business partner involved is 
the right type of partner for H&M group. 
If not, we exclude them from our busi -
ness partner list permanently.            2017 PROGRESS & LEARNINGS

We strongly believe that animals should 
always be treated humanely and have 
their basic needs met. Our animal wel -
fare policy outlines our commitment to 
source animal-based raw materials in a 
fully traceable and responsible way. All 
our suppliers must meet high standards 
of animal husbandry and fulfill our  animal welfare requirements.
Our Sustainability Commitment 
requires all relevant suppliers to follow 
our animal welfare and material ethics 
requirements. Any product that involves animal-based materials and merchan -
dise must follow a checklist of strict routines and instructions to ensure that the policy is being followed. We regularly 
train any merchandisers that work with 
suppliers on issues of compliance and traceability documentation. For example, we have introduced the new wool stand -
ard to our supply chain and established relationships further down our supply chain (including to the farm level).We also train our suppliers in our  
animal welfare and material ethics  
policy – both as part of the onboarding process and through refresher courses.

CHEMICAL RESTRICTIONS
To ensure the safety of our products and to limit  negative impacts on the environment and surrounding 
communities, we implement one of the strictest  
chemical management programmes in the industry. Our vision is to lead the change towards safe products and a 
toxic-free fashion future and our key goal is to achieve 
zero discharge of hazardous chemicals throughout our supply chain by 2020.
H&M group’s Chemical Restrictions List  bans and/or 
limits any chemicals that are considered hazardous. 
Compliance with our restrictions is mandatory for all 
our business partners. As a minimum, our chemical restrictions are always based on laws and regulations 
in each of our sales markets as well as information from 
authorities, NGOs and scientific reports. We apply the precautionary principle, meaning that we preventively 
restrict chemicals even where there is scientific uncer -
tainty. Accordingly, our requirements usually go further 
than the law demands.
We require all our business partners to take responsi -
bility for their own chemical management and we moni -
tor compliance via a series of self-assessment processes. 
Business partners send samples for third-party testing 
and the test results are submitted to H&M group for 
review and final approval. We also conduct dedicated chemical audits at our business partners factories and 
work with experts and our business partners to pro -
mote better chemical management practice throughout 
our industry.  STANDARDS & POLICIESKEY FACTS & FIGURES / STANDARDS & POLICIES EXPLAINED / WORKING WITH STANDARDS & POLICIES / OUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY / POLICIES WITHIN OUR OWN OPERATIONS / POLICIES FOR OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS / PRODUCTS & MATERIALS POLICIES

annually and includes sustainability strategies, 
challenges, activities, goals and performance for the 
global group operations of H & M Hennes & Mauritz 
AB (also called H&M group in this report), including 
all its brands (H&M, COS, Weekday, Cheap Monday, Monki, H&M Home, & Other Stories, ARKET), as well 
as its wholly-or partially-owned subsidiaries globally 
during our financial year from 1 December 2016 to 30 November 2017, unless stated otherwise. For a full 
list of entities, please see our Annual Report 2017 .
We address key impacts (positive and negative) across our value chain, and this is reflected in our reporting 
wherever possible. This means that our reporting scope often goes beyond or even outside of our own 
operations, for example covering business partners 
manufacturing our products. Information limited in scope such as specific brands, parts of our operations 
or our value chain is clearly stated in each respective 
section of this report. Unless stated, franchise opera -
tions are not included. The report has been reviewed by the highest executive management and external 
assurance has been performed for selected indicators 
(clearly marked where applicable, as well as in regards to materiality and stakeholder engagement). Addi -
tional stakeholder comments and interviews have been included throughout this report.All data is collected by our sustain- ability teams from relevant functions within our organisation and from 
external parties such as business part -
ners or implementation partners. This 
data is always reviewed by our inter -
nal controlling team, relevant experts in our sustainability team and expert functions following a two-tier quality 
control principle. Any extrapolations 
or estimations are clearly indicated.
The same goes for any changes in data 
methodologies or scopes that may influence data comparability. All data 
is based on the best possible systems 
that are currently available to us and where applicable aligned with recog -
nised standards. However, this needs to be seen in the light of continued improvements in data systems, 
methodologies and scientific uncer -
tainties. For example, while our GHG emissions accounting and reporting 
is aligned with the GHG Protocol , 
the emission factors we use are from 
publicly-available sources such as the 
International Energy Agency (IEA 2017), the Network for Transport 
Measures  (NTM), Reliable Disclosure 
System for Europe (RE-DISS) and 
supplier-specified emission factors. 
The global warming potential (GWP) factors used in the calculation of CO₂e 
are based on the IPCCs Fourth Assess -
ment Report (AR4) over a 100-year 
period. 
GHG emission data, as with other 
data, is subject to inherent uncer -
tainties due to incomplete scientific 
knowledge used to determine emis -
sion factors and resulting effects on measurements and estimations. The reported energy usage is based 
on invoiced data, data from real-
time electricity meters and data as reported by transport providers. 
Conversion between fuel usage and 
energy content has been done using energy values specified by the sup -
plier or by using tabled values pro -
vided by national bodies.
Our material reporting requires us to 
make assumptions on waste factors, 
weight per sizes, etc. We are con -
tinuously working to improve those 
aspects of reporting that may lead to 
minor updates in our yearly material 
consumption reporting, as well as our data systems and accuracy to report 
on material consumption. 
Unless otherwise specified, all data 
concerning business partners and supplier factories includes all suppli -
ers and factories that were active and approved for production during the 
reporting period. Factories included in our scope are tier 1 manufacturing or 
processing (i.e. washing or dyeing), fac -
tories that are owned or subcontracted 
by our suppliers and, where stated, 
selected tier 2 suppliers and suppliers 
for non-commercial goods (such as store interior suppliers). The tier 2 sup -
pliers we have selected so far are mostly fabric and yarn suppliers that account for about 60% of our products.
Monetary amounts are reported mainly 
in the currency of transaction. Addi -
tional currency values are conversions 
as approximate figures based on the 
conversion rate on 30 November 2017, 
unless stated otherwise.

UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES  
REPORTING FRAMEWORK
In 2015, we were one of the first companies 
in the world to report on human rights 
in line with the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework . This framework is 
the first comprehensive guidance for com -
panies to report on human rights issues in line with their responsibility to respect 
human rights set out in the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. The detailed references to the UN Guiding 
Principles Reporting Framework can be 
found at sustainability.hm.com
As part of this, we identified our salient 
human rights (page 92) in a compre -
hensive process we conducted in 2015, involving a variety of internal and exter -
nal stakeholders. Going forward, we plan 
to conduct this process every third year, 
or as deemed necessary. We will review the relevance and definitions of the issues identified and discuss emerging issues annually. This complements our materi -
ality assessment described below which 
identifies human rights as a highly 
material topic with further detail and granularity.
PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING  
THE MOST MATERIAL TOPICS  
AND THEIR BOUNDARIES*
1. Identification: Mapping aspects  
and creating a gross list
On a yearly basis, we review our gross list 
of aspects based on an analysis of external standards, such as the GRI 
Standard topic list, legislation, investor 
and NGO questionnaires, peer reviews, business intelligence, lifecycle assessment 
results, stakeholder dialogues and stake -
holder reports, and media coverage. The 
gross list has been checked against GRI’s 
Sustainability Context and Stakeholder 
Inclusiveness tests most recently in 2016. 
2. Prioritisation: Scoring and  
prioritising topics**
To prioritise the most material topics 
from this gross list, we scored the differ -
ent aspects in regards to their frequency 
raised by stakeholders and their sig -
nificance for economic, environmental 
and social impacts. Both categories were broken down into a number of different  categories, such as frequency raised by key defined sustainability stakeholders 
and experts (weighted x3), frequency 
featured in media (weighted x1) and frequency raised in key sustainabili -
ty benchmarks, rankings and indices (weighted x1) as well as social and en -
vironmental impacts (weighted x1) and 
importance to business strategy (weight -
ed x2). Scores were given by at least two 
internal experts per category and were 
based on lifecycle assessment (LCA) data 
and existing strategy documents.
Additionally, we selected at least one 
representative from each of our key stakeholder groups (which includes 
customers, colleagues, communities, 
suppliers and their employees, industry peers, NGOs, IGOs, policymakers and 
investors). Eleven stakeholder represent -
atives were asked to provide feedback on this materiality matrix.
Such full-on materiality assessments were 
conducted in 2013 and 2016, with reviews 
conducted in all other years since.
3. Regular review of our materiality 
matrix with key stakeholders*We review our materiality matrix on an annual basis. This can mean conducting  a full materiality analysis (as conducted in 
2013 and 2016) as described in 1 & 2 or a 
review of previous year’s matrix consider -
ing feedback received. 
REVIEW OF MATERIALITY  
MATRIX IN 2017
In spring 2017, we launched our updated 
sustainability strategy, which has been developed in close cooperation with sev -
eral external and internal key stakehold -
ers, partners and experts. In connection to this, we arranged a large-scale stakeholder 
meeting inviting over 300 representatives 
from our stakeholder communities to a 
full day of workshops and discussions, 
including feedback on our report and the focus areas chosen in our strategy.
Additionally, we have introduced a stand -
ardised stakeholder survey. The survey was 
developed together with Business for Social 
Responsibility  (BSR), which also conducted 
the 2017 survey. The survey assesses both 
the quality of our stakeholder engagement 
work as well as feedback on our strategy and performance towards it. The feedback 
we received widely confirmed our materi -
ality matrix, with some adjustments made, 
such as an increased focus on diversity & 
inclusiveness.HOW WE REPORTHOW WE REPORT / MATERIALITY MATRIX / OUR SALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES / UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS / ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS / KEY COLLABORATIONS / AUDITOR’S REPORT / GET IN TOUCH

H&M group conducted a thorough process of identi -
fying its salient human rights issues in 2015. Salient 
human rights issues are the human rights at risk of 
the most severe negative impact because of our oper -
ations and supply chain. This process supplements 
our materiality analysis in the area of human rights, 
with an understanding of risk to people.
We started out by defining who we impact through 
our business activities throughout our value chain, especially recognising those who potentially are 
more vulnerable and hence are more at risk, such 
as migrant workers, women and children. The result of this mapping was a list of both potential 
and actual human rights impacts. From this list, we 
identified those which were salient by applying two 
criteria: the severity of the potential impact and the 
likelihood that this impact will occur.
Consultations regarding the method and input to 
the identified salient human rights issues were held (both internally and externally) with almost 
100 people. Internally, consultations were held 
through workshops and dialogues on all levels of the company and across functions. Externally, con -
sultations were held with experts, organisations, academia and local stakeholders.
This process does not only guide us on the human 
rights issues relevant to report on according to the UNGP’s Reporting Framework, it also informs 
our strategies and work to address these issues 
going forward. To ensure our list of salient human rights issues remains relevant, we will review these issues annually, 
and the full process, including input 
from external stakeholders, will be conducted approximately every three 
years, or more frequently if necessary. 
While we take steps to mitigate all risks, salience guides us in what to 
focus on within human rights and 
hence informs our strategies and work.
The most recent review took place 
at the end of 2017 and resulted in 
slightly adjusted definitions on, for 
example, social security, highlighting 
that we refer to social security linked 
to employment. We also expanded child labour to the broader children’s 
rights due to the various ways our 
activities directly and indirectly impact children, while still recogniz -
ing child labour as an issue of great severity. 
Identification, prevention and reme -
diation of our salient human rights 
issues are found throughout the 
report. They are also referenced in 
our annual update of salient issues presented on page 92.HOW WE REPORT

Modern slavery.
DISCRIMINATION  
AND HARASSMENTIn hiring and/or in the workplace, discrimination: unfair or humiliating treatment on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, race, colour, age, pregnancy, marital or social status, religion, political opinion, nationality, ethnic origin, disease or disability. Harassment; humiliating or corporal punishment or subject to physical, 
sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse. A risk throughout the value chain and heightened risk for vulnerable groups, 
such as women and migrant workers.Internal policies, updates (see pg 80).

(see pg 59–67, 74–78).
CHILDREN’S RIGHTSThe rights of children as per the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children. 
Child labour is defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity,  
and that is harmful to their physical and mental development (UN CRC, CRBP, ILO Conventions).Children are directly and indirectly impacted by business activities  
throughout the value chain. 
Child labour is a potential risk in the supply chain, but more prominent 
upstream the value chain.Mica strategy update (see pg 66).Myanmar collaboration CCRCSR  
(see pg 66). Better Cotton Initiative  
(see pg 36). Modern slavery .
FREEDOM OF ASSOCI -
ATION & COLLECTIVE  BARGAININGA person’s right to join, and/or form, organisations of his/her own choosing and to bargain collectively  
(ILO Convention 87, 98, 135, 154).Mainly in the supply chain but also relevant for own operations.Industrial relations production (see pg 60). Employee relations (see pg 57).
SOCIAL SECURITYSocial security involves access to health care and income security, particularly in cases of old age,  
unemployment, sickness, invalidity, work injury, maternity or loss of a main income earner.Mainly an obligation belonging to the responsibility of the State as defined by the UN Guiding Principles, but relevant especially in supply chain countries and some retail markets where a lack of legal frameworks or institutional 
capacity sufficiently addressing this issue is common.
Advocacy (see pg 62).
Cambodia, fixed duration contracts 
(see pg 67). Turkey, Syrian refugees

ACCESS TO WATER Safe water and enough supply, accessible and affordable for personal and domestic use. Communities in the value chain in both production and retail markets.Water strategy (see pg 40).
Chemical management (see pg 39)
LAND RIGHTSLand is an issue that directly impacts the enjoyment of a number of human rights as land is a source  
of livelihood, central to economic rights and also often tied to social and cultural rights. How land is used is  
also a related issue. Disputes over land can be a cause of conflict and sometimes involve illegal  
displacement of people. Potential risk in the supply chain linked to raw materials and locations of 
industrial and commercial facilities. Proactively protecting land rights  (see pg 81 in H&M group Sustaina  bility

As a customer-focused 
company, understanding and meeting and exceeding 
the needs and demands of 
all our brands customers is at the core of everything we do.Our aim is to contribute to the economic and societal development of 
the communities around 
us, be it our stores, offices or warehouses or the communities we touch in our value chain.Our more than 171,000 colleagues are key to our success. We want all of 
them to feel proud of work -
ing for H&M group. Coming 
from all over the world, we share and work along the same corporate values.Our suppliers are our val -
ued business partners. Sta -
ble and long-term relations 
are key to mutual growth. 
Strengthening and enabling their ownership over their sustainability issues is important in enabling long-term sustainable 
development.Our suppliers employ over 
1.6 million people, most of them women in emerging 
markets. This provides 
a great opportunity to improve the livelihood of people, their families and communities. Making sure they have a voice in fair and 
constructive negotiations 
and industrial relations is a key element to our strategy.Many challenges are best addressed collectively. We work with industry peers 
and even companies oper -
ating in other sectors to 
define industry standards and common responses to shared challenges. H&M group, our value chain and our customers are subject to rules set by 
policymakers. Maintaining 
dialogue with them helps us to stay informed about, and sometimes to help shape, the legal and regulatory context in a 
responsible manner.We follow a science-based 
approach as part of our sustainability strategy. Inno -
vation is key to addressing some of our industry’s greatest challenges and opportunities. Therefore, engaging with academia and science is vital to our 
continued strategy devel -
opment and to meeting our 
ambitious goals.NGOs are often expert advisers on standards and practices throughout 
our value chain. We rely 
on their expertise and independence to ensure that we meet the most up-to-date standards and to make us aware of any 
concerns. With many, we 
work in close collaboration and also implement part -
nerships.H&M group is a publicly listed company. As such, we are accountable to our 
investors. We prioritise our 
most important investors in a direct dialogue wherever possible and integrate feedback we receive in our strategies and to inform 
our sustainability reporting, 
striving for the greatest possible transparency.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY
The Management of H&M group is responsible for preparing and present -
ing H&M group Sustainability Report 2017 in accordance with the reporting 
criteria as set out in the company’s own 
reporting guidelines as well as the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Standards.
As discussed in the section “How we 
report”, on page 88 in H&M group 
Sustainability Report 2017, greenhouse 
gas quantification is subject to inher -
ent uncertainty because of incomplete 
scientific knowledge used to determine 
emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express a conclu -
sion on the above-specified indicators in H&M group Sustainability Report 2017 based on the limited assurance 
procedures we have performed. The 
selection of indicators to be reviewed has been made by the management of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB. We do not accept, 
nor assume responsibility to anyone else, 
except to H&M group for our work, for the limited assurance report, or for the 
conclusion that we have reached.
We conducted our limited assurance 
engagement in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 ‘Assurance 
Engagements Other than Audits or 
Reviews of Historical Financial Infor -
mation’. The ISAE 3000 standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
assurance engagement to obtain limited 
assurance on whether any matters have come to our attention that would cause 
us to believe that the above-specified 
information in H&M group Sustainabil -
ity Report 2017 has not been prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with 
the reporting criteria.
A limited assurance engagement is pro -
vided only on the information disclosed 
in H&M group Sustainability Report 
2017, not on information linked to 
and disclosed on other web pages. The Auditor’s report
presented information in H&M group Sustainability Report 2017 is to be con -
sidered in connection with the explan -
atory information on data collection, consolidation and assessments provided by H&M group. This independent limited 
assurance report should not be used on 
its own as a basis for interpreting H&M group’s performance in relation to its 
principles of corporate responsibility.
Our review procedures are designed to 
obtain limited assurance on whether the 
above-specified indicators are presented in accordance with the Sustainabil -
ity Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative, in all material respects. A limited assurance engage -
ment consists of making inquiries, primary of persons responsible for the preparation of H&M group Sustainability 
Report 2017 and applying analytical and 
other evidence gathering procedures, as 
appropriate. The procedures performed 
in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature from, and are less in 
extent than for, a reasonable assurance 
engagement conducted in accordance with IAASB’s Standards on Auditing 
and Quality Control and other generally 
accepted auditing standards. The firm applies ISQC 1 (International Standard 
on Quality Control) and accordingly HOW WE REPORTHOW WE REPORT / MATERIALITY MATRIX / OUR SALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES / UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS / ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS / KEY COLLABORATIONS / AUDITOR’S REPORT  / GET IN TOUCHH&M GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201798 OF 100HOW WE REPORT OVERVIEW STANDARDS & POLICIES VISION & STRATEGY 100% LEADING THE CHANGE 100% CIRCULAR & RENEWABLE 100% FAIR & EQUAL

quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding 
compliance with ethical requirements,

cant matters that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reason -
able assurance conclusion.
Our procedures are based on the criteria 
defined by the Management as described 
above. We consider these criteria suit -
able for the preparation of H&M group

that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our conclusion below
CONCLUSION
Based on our work described in this report, nothing has come to our atten -
tion that causes us to believe that the information regarding the above-speci -
fied indicators in H&M group Sustaina -
bility Report 2017 has not, in all material respects, been prepared in accordance with the reporting criteria stated above.
