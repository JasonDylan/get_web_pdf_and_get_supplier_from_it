Services Thank you for taking the time to peruse Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs CSR report. To align with international trends, 
Chunghwa Telecom has adopted the practice of disclosing non-financial information based on the core option of 
‚ÄúGlobal Reporting Initiative Standards‚Äù and ‚ÄúIntegrated Reporting Framework‚Äù (IR) for its 10th CSR report. The report 
focuses on disclosing material topics of concern to stakeholders and is intended to demonstrate Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs 
management efforts and value creation capacities concerning the United Nation‚Äôs sustainability issues.
Owing to the contribution of its employees, Chunghwa Telecom was able to deliver consolidated revenues totaling 
NT$ 230.01 billion in 2016. In addition to achieving top business performance among peers, we value CSR as much 
as we value profits and growth. Under the leadership of the CSR Committee and contribution of all its employees, 
Chunghwa Telecom has made several key CSR accomplishments in 2016, including:
The only company in the Greater China Region chosen for DJSI - World and DJSI - Emerging Markets at the 
same time for the 4th consecutive year
Won the World Branding Awards 2016-2017
Awarded the highest rating in TWSE/TPEX Information Disclosure Evaluation for 10 consecutive years
Rated among the top 5% in TWSE‚Äôs corporate governance evaluation for two consecutive years
Ranked among the top 10 in CommonWealth Magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúCorporate Citizen Awards - Large Corporations‚Äù for 
10 consecutive years
Won the 12th Global Vision CSR Award ‚Äì The Exemplar Award by Global Views Monthly Magazine
Obtained a long-term credit rating of ‚ÄúAA‚Äù from S&P and a long-term/short-term credit rating of ‚ÄútwAAA/twA-
1+‚Äù from Taiwan Ratings
In addition to its efforts in corporate governance, environmental protection and social responsibilities, Chunghwa 
Telecom continues to utilize its information and communication technologies to help Taiwanese businesses realize 
sustainability goals and exert a positive social influence.
Meanwhile, Chunghwa Telecom actively supports the nation‚Äôs digital economy policies and broadband infrastructures, 
and has envisioned itself as ‚Äúthe motivator of digital economy and the pilot of the creative industry‚Äù by promoting 
high-quality, diverse and cross-platform digital streaming services. 4G is a highly competitive service in Taiwan, and 
as we anticipate competition to remain intensive in the future, Chunghwa Telecom moved ahead of its competitors 
by opening up the 2600MHz band in 2016, and thus increased network capacity for higher quality 4G services for the 
benefit of consumers and corporate customers. In the meantime, the Company has executed a comprehensive IoT 
strategy and expanded industry alliance to include businesses such as information security, energy, optoelectronics, 
etc. to inspire more creative applications and business models. So far, revenues from information security and cloud 
services have increased by more than 42% annually, while revenues from IoT service have also grown by 43%. 
Creative services and businesses are still expected to contribute revenues and profit growth over the next 3 to 5 
years.
To respond and capitalize on the low-carbon opportunities endowed by the Paris Agreement, Chunghwa Telecom 
has been taking steps to transform itself into a green enterprise. The Company has participated in the ‚Äú4G Smart City 
Broadband Subsidy Program‚Äù organized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in which the Company collaborations 
with 15 city/county governments to create a convenient, healthy and friendly city through technology. Also, Chunghwa 
Telecom has  contributed its advantage and expertise as an information and communication leader to fulfill its 5G 
(Green) vision: ‚ÄúGreen Energy, Green Procurement, Green Operations, Green Stores and Green Supply Chain.‚Äù It strives 
to become a green enterprise with a balanced focus between business development and environmental protection.
In terms of sustainable actions, Chunghwa Telecom purchased 4 million kWh of green electricity in 2016, ranking first 
in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry and second nationwide. The Company has also been 
active in the development of renewable energy, and installed 42 solar energy stations throughout Taiwan. In 2017, the 
Company‚Äôs solar power plants are expected to achieve a total capacity of more than 500kWp. Furthermore, we are 
planning to turn all our service centers nationwide to Green Stores to provide more green products and services to 
consumers. Chunghwa Telecom expects revenues from green products and services to exceed NT$ 1 billion by 2020.Message from the Chairman
102-14
While pursuing innovation, Chunghwa Telecom also ensures the citizens‚Äô rights to basic communications. We support 
the United Nation‚Äôs Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the government‚Äôs ‚ÄúDIGI+‚Äù program by contributing to 
people‚Äôs rights to broadband Internet access. Our actions in this respect include construction of fiber optic networks, 
infrastructure development in remote areas and the creation of an environment that facilitates digital innovation. It 
is our commitment to narrow the digital divide and create digital opportunities. We build and maintain broadband 
networks in 84 remote locations throughout Taiwan, which helps the indigenous people connect to the world and earn 
income in the form of tourism and agriculture. Through Chunghwa Telecom Foundation‚Äôs long-term programs such as 
‚ÄúDigital Community‚Äù and ‚ÄúClick Taiwan,‚Äù we utilize technology to inspire a cycle of decency and enhance Chunghwa 
Telecom‚Äôs connection with residents in various parts of Taiwan.
In the future, Chunghwa Telecom shall commit to its ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù brand spirit and devotion of ‚Äúvalue and responsibilities,‚Äù 
and inspire a cycle of decency by delivering performance not just in profits, but in terms of environmental protection 
and social inclusion as well. Through integrative thinking, we hope to propose solutions that are mutually beneficial 
to the society, the environment and the industry, and continue building our reputation as ‚Äúthe most valuable and 
trustworthy ICT company‚Äù with our expertise, technologies, and visions.
Chairman of the Board 
 Determining Materials 
and Stakeholders
We intend to provide all stakeholders concerned with the future of the telecommunication industry and Chunghwa 
Telecom with a more comprehensive understanding of how Chunghwa Telecom has exerted its industry influence on 
CSR issues. This purpose has improved the quality of our actions and disclosures.
Boundaries of Material IssuesStep.1 CSR Secretariat is responsible for collecting the materials including international guidelines, sustainability 
rating survey, international benchmark (ex. GRI 3.1 Telecommunications Sector Supplement), etc. to 
support the meeting of sustainability report.
Step.2Through opinions, feedback and external questionnaires, we re-assess short/medium/long-term CSR 
goals and accomplishments, then review our strategies, management practices, measures, responses, 
and possible adjustments and improvements of our goals.
Step.3Based on internal consideration, industry status, industry chain practice, and the recommendation of 
stakeholders, we asked CSR Group members to confirm the potential impact of the material issues within 
and outside the organization, in other words, the positive, negative, or potential impact on the economy, 
environment, and society, and later invite key parties within and outside the organization to conduct 
discussion and disclose the impact.
Step.4We assemble an assessment team consisting of members from related departments to identify the 
materiality matrix on the ground of internal and external information.

Chunghwa Telecom is also willing to disclose issues that are not identified as material issues in 2016, please refer to p.118 
and take note of the themes with the asterisk (*).
Identification of key stakeholders and issues is the main focus of implementing CSR. By preparing the conference of 
CSR reports, we invite members from all departments to exchange the issues related to current key stakeholders and 
their concerns. Upon reaching mutual understanding, the result is incorporated into a table which in turn is regarded as 
the essential reference for preparing the disclosure in the report.

we consult the opinion and recommendation of the internal and 
external stakeholders, important relevant mechanisms including

 Issue #1: Concerns Toward the Emission of Electromagnetic Waves from Base Stations
Service providers are compelled to provide good quality voice transmission and fast mobile connection to the 
Internet. However, some citizens still have concerns about the electromagnetic wave. As such, people tend 
to request for the removal of base stations already installed as ‚Äúelectromagnetic waves will jeopardize our 
health‚Äù even though the landlord has agreed with the installation. The valid cognitions about electromagnetic 
wave are: 
1. The electromagnetic wave emitted from the base station is non-ionizing radiation and the 
electromagnetic  particle entails very low energy. It will not give out heat or cause damage to the cell 
molecules of organisms. As such, it will not affect the health of h uman beings. 
2. The measurement of the electromagnetic wave in the environment conforms to the standard of the 
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), which must be lower than 
0.45 ŒºW/cm2 at 900MHz and must be less than 0.9ŒºW/cm2 at 1,800MHz. Modern users typically leave 
cell phones on almost 24 hours a day. As long as the cell phone is on, the device will continuously emit 
electromagnetic waves to keep its connection with the base station; in other words, ‚Äúusers are exposed to 
more electromagnetic wave from cell phones than from base stations, by as much as one thousand times 
and above.‚Äù
According to ‚ÄúGlobal Mobile Consumer Trends,‚Äù 
the global population averages 40 cell phones uses per person, per day.
According to a report by World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to base stations and Wi-Fi signals 
does not affect human health; currently, there is no scientific evidence to suggest harmful effects of 
electromagnetic waves emitted from base station on the human body.
As described above, the electromagnetic waves generated by base stations are not as damaging as rumored. 
There are many professional websites, local and abroad, that support this claim. However, any resident who 
has concerns regarding base stations near their home can request a complimentary measurement of the 
strength of the nearby electro- magnetic waves by calling 0800-580-010.

1.Definition of ‚Äúconfined space‚Äù
(According to article 19-1 of the Regulations Of Occupational Safety and 
Health Facility)
‚Ä¢ The space that is not provided for the workers to perform regular jobs.
‚Ä¢ Space where the accessing is restricted.
‚Ä¢ Space where sufficient and clean air cannot be maintained by natural 
ventilation method.
2.Confined space operating hazard prevention measures
‚Ä¢ Before starting the work, check if the worker‚Äôs physical status and the air 
change device are presenting any abnormal signs. In the meantime, it is 
also required to examine the concentration of the oxygen and the harmful 
gas at the job site.
‚Ä¢ The oxygen in the operating space shall be appropriately replenished, and 
the oxygen concentration of the operation site shall be over 18%.
‚Ä¢ When performing the dangerous oxygen deficiency operations, it is 
required to assign more than one supervising person and the rescue crew 
to the job site.
‚Ä¢ All workers shall receive the required safety and hygienic education and 
training.
‚Ä¢ Check and replace the operations and test equipment on a periodically. One of Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs contractors was assigned to lay optic fiber cables in Qishan District, but due 
to lack of proper ventilation inside the manhole, the workers inhaled hazardous gas, causing one injury and 
one death. The accident was escalated through the major accident reporting system as soon as it occurred. 
We then coordinated fully with the Labor Inspection Division to make the necessary improvements, and 
supervised the contractor to compensate the victimized workers and family members.

Chunghwa Telecom is the largest integrated telecommunication carrier in Taiwan. Our head office is located at 21-3 
Hsinyi Road, Section 1, Taipei. In August 2005, we became a privatized company as the ownership by the government 
was reduced to less than 50%, and the management system officially transformed from a state-owned enterprise to a 
privately-owned enterprise. 
Our main business consists of three major areas: fixed, mobile, and data communications, providing voice services, 
private circuits, Internet, broadband Internet, smart network, virtual network, e-commerce, corporate customer 
integration ICT services and various value-added services. There are 742 service locations. We use the best network 
and service quality as the backing to create intelligent communication environments and exciting yet convenient digital 
lives for our users. Chunghwa Telecom is also an important business partner of other international telecommunication 
carriers. We have been actively involved in different ‚Äúcorporate social responsibility‚Äù conducts in recent years, and

In 2016, Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs tax expenses were

e-Commerce, Electronics and Entertainment into a new segment called eICT to recognize the increasingly common 
cross-industry collaboration.
The wave of digital convergence brings new values to the telecommunication industry and opportunities to meet

Intensive Competition of the 4G Market
The introduction of 4G technology has enabled carriers to exceed existing bandwidth and speed limitations 
and deliver faster Internet services. In turn, it gave rise to broader applications and presented both risks and 
opportunities to Chunghwa Telecom. In 2016, Chunghwa Telecom opened up the 2600MHz band ahead of 
its peers, and dominated the industry with a maximum bandwidth of 130MHz. By utilizing ‚Äútri-band carrier 
aggregation‚Äù technology, the Company managed to increase 4G speed beyond 300Mbps and once again 
led Taiwan‚Äôs mobile communication industry into a new era of high-speed 4G service.
Chunghwa Telecom had accumulated 6.71 million 4G customers by the end of 2016. In an attempt to keep 
up with the rapidly changing and increasingly competitive environment, the Company has committed 
significant resources to innovative research and development (totaling NT$ 3.8 billion in 2016; representing 
1.6% of overall revenues) to improve customers‚Äô mobile broadband experience and digital lifestyle and 
continuously exploit bandwidths of the 4G technology.
Risks
Five carriers offer 4G services in Taiwan, making it a highly competitive business. Competition in 4G mobile 
will only intensify and pose a threat to Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs operations in the future.
Opportunities
Smart city and Internet of things (e.g., Internet of vehicles, remote education, hospital monitoring, smart 
home, smart energy, etc.) are two prominent trends. Combined with big data applications, they open up 
new products and services for Chunghwa Telecom.
Target
Introduce 4G/Wi-Fi service to Taoyuan Metro and Taiwan High Speed Rail, increasing customer base to 8.71 
million; explore innovative and value-adding applications to enhance mobile Internet usage.The Scope of Chunghwa Telecom Risk Management Regulations

Chunghwa Telecom places great emphasis on business risk management as a means of ensuring stability against 
impacts from the external environment and internal operations. It has the ‚ÄúRisk Management Policy‚Äù in place to guide 
employees‚Äô actions. The board of directors outlines the Company‚Äôs risk management policies, framework, and culture. 
The secretariat assists the board in the implementation of risk management practices throughout the Company.
The Audit Division audits risk practices and reports findings back to the board. In 2016, the Company established its 
Risk Management Committee consisting of the President as the convener and senior managers as members of the 
committee. The committee supervises risk management throughout the organization and is responsible for prioritizing 
the identified risks, formulating response strategies to key risk issues, and reporting to the board of directors at times 
deemed necessary.
Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs risk management practices involve ongoing analysis of operational goals, the accuracy of 
financial reports, and impacts of high-risk events. These findings are constantly reviewed to ensure that all business 
risks can be identified and controlled, and thereby maintain business operations while protecting stakeholders‚Äô 
interests. We also have an enterprise risk management (ERM) system in place to control risks associated with our 
businesses. Risk managers have been assigned to all departments to monitor risk targets and risk events, and 
report findings on a monthly basis. Risk managers are also involved in the review and adjustment of risk measures, 
assessment of risk impacts, and execution of systematic records, management, and follow-up trackings.
We use a ‚Äúrisk map‚Äù for assessing regulatory risks, network maintenance risks, market competition risks, and financial 
risks. For every major concern identified in our operations, we conduct intensive sensitivity analysis and stress-testing 
to decide whether we should take steps to accept, transfer, mitigate or avoid the associated risks, thereby minimize 
our possible losses. Risk management expenditures are expected to be disclosed in 2017.Responsible

Involvement in Next-generation Telecom Technology
In attempting to gain an early insight into next-generation telecommunication technologies, Chunghwa 
Telecom has not only committed significant resources to R&D and actively involved itself in setting the new 
standards (under 3GPP), but also explored means to strengthen connections with local and foreign industry 
participants. In 2015, Chunghwa Telecom joined Taiwan Association of Information and Communication 
Standards (TAICS) and Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance (NGMN); both of which are significant to 
the development of 5G technology. 
Chunghwa Telecom is the only Taiwanese carrier to join NGMN, which now has 28 members from around the 
world. Chunghwa Telecom has one representative on the NGMN board to bridge Taiwan‚Äôs 5G development 
with the world. 
*O
‚Ä¢ February - Chunghwa Telecom participated in the Mobile World Congress (MWC) organized by NGMN 
in Spain to discuss work plans and short-term goals of NGMN. This involvement raises the influence and 
visibility of Taiwan‚Äôs telecommunication carriers globally.
‚Ä¢ March - Chunghwa Telecom hosted NGMN‚Äôs first member conference in Taiwan to help connect Taiwan‚Äôs 
telecommunication industry with the world.
‚Ä¢ October - Joined TAICS and MediaTek in hosting a 5G Technology Workshop that helped Taiwanese 
industries connect with the rest of the world and made early investments to 5G technology. 
In early 2017, Chunghwa Telecom led industry participants and equipment suppliers to completing a Pre-
5G NB-IoT test in collaboration with Nokia. By expanding the mobile network to connect all things in life, 
the Company helped create a broader diversity of applications and services. Chunghwa Telecom signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding for collaboration on SDN/NFV With NTT Japan and the headquarters of 
ITOCHU. All parties will be collectively engaged in the development of the common specifications for the 
next-generation network.
Pay Attention to Digital Convergence Development
Chunghwa Telecom maintains constant communication with government agencies and authorities to keep 
informed of the possible changes in important policies and regulations. The one amongst all that concerns 
the competitiveness of the ICT industry the most would be the ‚ÄúDigital Convergence Plan.‚Äù
The National Communications Commission (NCC) announced its new policy guidelines in August 2016 
that includes an adjustment and re-drafting of the existing regulatory framework for digital convergence. In 
January 2017, the NCC announced the draft ‚ÄúTelecommunications Management Act‚Äù and the draft ‚ÄúDigital 
Communication Act‚Äù and solicited comments from the public. Once the administrative procedures have 
been completed, these two drafts will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and consideration. 
Chunghwa Telecom will keep monitoring the situation of regulatory amendments and express our opinions 
where appropriate.

The climate change issues and a company‚Äôs long-term business positioning is closely related. To reduce climate-
related cost and risk in the value chain and evaluate the result of voluntary carbon reduction measures, Chunghwa 
Telecom initiated ‚ÄúGreenhouse Gas Inventory‚Äù in 2008.
Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs initial carbon management goals were to ‚Äúreduce greenhouse gas emission to 2007 levels by 2012,‚Äù 
which had been achieved ahead of schedule in 2011 due to proper control. Assuming an annual growth of 2% for 4G and 
mobile communication services, the Company will inevitably be required to install additional communication equipment, 
which consumes more power and emits more greenhouse gases. In view of this development, we have revised and set a 
new greenhouse gas target in 2013, which is to:
The total greenhouse gas emission is 839,172.07 t-CO 2e in 2016, including CO 2, CH 4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF 6. As an 
integrated telecom carrier, most energy source consumed by Chunghwa Telecom is electricity, which is classified as 
Scope 2 (purchased electricity) gas emission and accounted for 96.71% of total gas emission. Scope 1 gas emission is 
normally sourced from greenhouse gas emissions such as offices and accounted for 3.29% of total gas emissions.Benchmarking 2012 GHG emission standard, 
and control the annual growth of GHG emission to no more than 2%.

world, Chunghwa Telecom has also discussed carbon footprints 
associated with employees‚Äô business travels in 2013. Boundaries 
have been set at ‚ÄúScope 3,‚Äù as specified by World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), while emission 
was calculated based on mileage. 
The Company‚Äôs Scope 3 emission in 2016 was 240,879.02 kg-
CO 2e. Emission from employees‚Äô business travels was calculated 
based on the two main forms of transportation: high-speed 
rail and airplane. On a long-term perspective, the Company is 
planning to include consumers‚Äô impacts into Scope 3 calculation 
so that the greenhouse gas inventory system may produce a more 
comprehensive picture.
Action Program in Response to Climate Change
In order to manage risks caused by climate change, we completed the ‚ÄúChunghwa Telecom Environmental

maintained up to 72 hours (3 hours in regular facilities) to support the remote areas, when necessary, SMR 
capacity can be enlarged.Unit: kg-CO 2e
Go All Out - Typhoon Disasters
Typhoon disasters repeatedly ravaged Taiwan in 2016. Typhoon Nepartak, Meranti, and Megi were the 
most severe, all achieving wind force of 17 on the Beaufort scale that caused massive damage. Chunghwa 
Telecom‚Äôs networks have been planned, designed and constructed after fully taking into account disaster 
prevention and backup capacity, in order to prevent disaster areas from being isolated from the outside 
world. Although the series of Typhoon disasters caused severe damage to base stations throughout the 
nation, no remote town or village was rendered completely isolated due to loss of mobile communication.
Due to previous experiences with emergency repairs during the arrival of Typhoon Soudelor in 2015, 
Chunghwa Telecom had put many efforts into preparation for Typhoon. By adding protections to key 
communication facilities, and supplying service stations in disaster-prone areas with backup power, tools, 
fuel, cables, and satellite phones, the Company may minimize its damage and deploy tools properly to 
shorten the time of repair. In addition to monitoring Typhoon news, we prioritized our technicians to service 
critical networks and base stations in the event of a disaster. Engineers were called to different areas to 
support the repair, and a total of 15,642 people were mobilized throughout the typhoon disasters to ensure 
restoration of basic communication within the shortest time.

Reports, CSR Reports, press conferences and investor conferences to facilitate transparent communication with 
stakeholders. Furthermore, measures have been taken to ensure the timeliness, quality, balance, and credibility of 
information disclosed.
Since information disclosure assessment was launched by Securities & Futures Institute in 2004, Chunghwa Telecom 
has been rated A++ and ranked among the top 10 in every year. Also in 2015 and 2016, the Company ranked among 
the top 5% in TWSE‚Äôs corporate governance evaluation. These two achievements are a testament to the efforts we 
have devoted in information disclosure.Chunghwa Telecom has the ‚ÄúEmployee Appraisal Guidelines‚Äù and the ‚ÄúEmployee Reward/Disciplinary Standards‚Äù in 
place to evaluate employees‚Äô performance. Rewards and disciplines are issued according to these rules whenever 
employees exhibit conducts that deserve them.
Information such as grievance hotline has been made available at Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs intranet/employee portal. The 
Company accepted and closed 42 cases of complaint in 2016; 7 were associated with violation of the code of conduct 
(no corruption events). All complaints were investigated and handled according to Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs internal policies

ManagementWe published the ‚ÄúCode of Corporate Social Responsibility for Suppliers of Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd.‚Äù in 2011, and 
it clearly outlines the Company‚Äôs expectations in terms of ‚Äúbusiness, ethics, labor, environment, safety, and health.‚Äù 
The guidelines apply to all suppliers that provide products or services to Chunghwa Telecom or its subsidiaries or joint 
ventures, and extends to other participants of the supply chain that the supplier is directly or indirectly related to. We 
hope that suppliers may commit to our values and take more proactive steps toward maintaining a sustainable business 
relationship.
Chunghwa Telecom share our resources with the suppliers to help them develop R&D capabilities and future 
technologies. We also devote ourselves in the creation of a friendly and innovative environment. We engage suppliers 
in R&D projects and reward their contributions, and make arrangements to transfer acquired technology licenses fairly. 
Regarding hardware, we continue to support the development of telecom facilities and testing environment; in terms of 
software, we utilize open platforms to share our benefits with supplier s.Mutual Benefits with Business Partners

accountability from the source and among manufacturers. In doing so, we invited suppliers to realize our 
green product vision.
Invitation to an ecological tour
The ecological tour is a responsible way to travel. By changing people‚Äôs lifestyles and travel behaviors, we 
aimed to reduce impacts of human activities to the environment.
Professional corporate social responsibility courses
According to suppliers‚Äô feedback, most suppliers desired a ‚Äúbetter understanding of corporate social 
responsibility management system.‚Äù Through courses and exchange of experiences, we engaged suppliers 
in a series of discussions about corporate social responsibility management and helped each other moving 
forward.

Sustainable Products and Services
Changes in the global environment and climate have given rise to the idea of low-carbon economy and green 
consumption. Sustainable products and services will gradually become the mainstream in consumers‚Äô purchases, 
which we believe will be made possible once the smart city and related applications become available.
Chunghwa Telecom remains devoted in green innovation, and strives to accomplish our goals through green 
consumption, green service, and green activities. We hope to apply our advantages in environmental protection and 
energy conservation onto existing products and services, as we view business and environmental sustainability our 
competitive focuses and opportunities. In 2016, there were NT$ 6.36 billion revenues from green products, which 
accounted for 2.8% of total revenues.

National Time and Frequency Standards - Leap Second Service
Chunghwa Telecom has been commissioned by the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection, Ministry 
of Economic Affairs, to maintain time and frequency to the highest standard. It compares data with the rest 
of the world to ensure consistency with global standards. Chunghwa Telecom is a participant of International 
Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), and joins other participants in maintaining Coordinated Universal 
Time (UTC) and International Atomic Time (TAI). Domestically, Chunghwa Telecom serves as the common 
source for all time-frequency analyses and calibrations performed by local businesses; it distributes national 
standard time via telecommunication technology to satisfy the public‚Äôs need for standard time.Pre-5G NB-IoT Testing 
Driven by a dedication to innovative research and service, Chunghwa Telecom joined Nokia and led the 
nation in the testing of NB-IoT (Narrow Band Internet of Things) over Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs 4.5G network. In 
doing so, the Company contributes to the development and popularity of IoT applications in Taiwan.
We have collaborated with Nokia to install smart outdoor sensor s with built-in NB-IoT modules at farmhouses 
located in Taoyuan City. The sensor gathers environmental data such as atmospheric pressure, humidity, 
temperature, etc. and transmits them to data users far away for real-time monitoring and analysis. The project 
helps detect frost damage on crops and enables analysis of climate impacts on crop growth. Other possible 
applications include air quality monitoring, water quality monitoring, and pet tracking.
The difference between 5G and 4G lies in the connection between objects. NB-IoT is the current IoT 
technology used in the Pre-5G stage; it has many advantages such as wide coverage, low power 
consumption, low cost, large-scale connection support, stability, reliability and security that make it suitable 
for IoT applications including smart meter, smart road lamp, and smart parking. It has been regarded as the 
leading technology for 5G IoT applications, and is believed to have the potential for vertical applications.

We have launched the transformation and upgrading plan for the stores to renew our service quality and allow 
consumers to receive quick and convenient service. Related measures are:
‚Ä¢ Develop more business locations for bolstering our service network: by the end of December 2016, we have 
established 167 service centers, 463 stores, and 279 franchised stores, which made up the total of 742 
service stations.
‚Ä¢ Set ‚Äúdistrict consultant‚Äù who is responsible for coaching retail store management and marketing 
performance, to enhance the management efficiency of the store operations.
‚Ä¢ Establish the system of self-inspection, audit, and supervision for service quality; all stores must conduct 
self-inspection and business offices will conduct random inspection and audits to upgrade over-the-counter 
service quality.
‚Ä¢ We actively support the ‚ÄúGreen Consumption‚Äù program of the Environmental Protection Administration, 
Executive Yuan, as part of our energy conservation and environmental protection initiative. More than 
NT$ 59 million worth of energy-saving products were sold in 2016. We expect to convert 406 service 
centers into ‚ÄúGreen Stores‚Äù in 2017, and sell more than 3 environment-certified products through each of 
them. Through the introduction of ‚ÄúChunghwa Telecom Green Stores,‚Äù we encourage consumers to make 
green products the priority of their purchases.
Quantity of Products and Services Approximately 2,873 unit.
Customer Service KiosksServe as the ‚ÄúDrop-off Section‚Äù for business and engineering-related information. Upon 
receiving new business or engineering-related information, the accountable employee

Information Incident Procedure Handbook.‚ÄùProper Management of Personal Information
Chunghwa Telecom duly observes the Personal Information Protection Act in the collection, processing, and use of 
personal information and guarantees the security of customer information through the strictly designed management 
system. We have assembled a Personal Information Protection Task Force under the Information Strategy Committee 
and complied with regulations of the National Communications Commission by implementing personal information 
protection policies, organizing information security training, enforcing risk management measures, and creating 
performance indicators. We also actively enforce personal information management and auditor certification for 
internal employees, and invest resources into the training of personal information managers and internal assessment 
specialists.
In 2016, there were 35 cases of complaints on alleged information leaking, increased 8 cases than 2015. Complaints of 
this type approximately accounted for only 0.0001% of our customer service hotline. Cases of complaints were filed via all 
available channels, none of which had been proven to violate the relevant regulations.
In an attempt to provide each department with the right incentives to enforce personal information protection, we 
organize one competition every 6 months and reward top 3 performers with trophies and prizes. The competition 
rates participants on several aspects including cross-server virus alert, social engineering email test, third-party 
verification, IRMAS (Windows patch, virus code update), and personal information incidents.
Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs customer service principles - ‚ÄúListening, caring, and engaging.‚Äù 
We serve customers with passion and professionalism; 
we relentlessly refine and pursue better service quality.
To focus on enhancing service quality, the customer service hotline has obtained many international certifications over 
the years. Since the end of 2016, the Company has set its goals to deliver the best customer experience. Some of 
the customer experience indicators and service quality indicators were therefore implemented at points of direct and 
indirect contact with customers. We tapped into these points of contact by gathering customers‚Äô voices and applying 
big data analysis to uncover hidden problems and ways to optimize existing procedures. We also use big data 
analysis to learn customers‚Äô true needs and take the initiative to care for customers and offer customized services and 
products. Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs customer-centric brand commitment and its efforts in promoting customer experience 
management across all channels were awarded the ‚Äú2016 APCCAL Awards - Best Customer Experience Management 
in Taiwan.‚Äù
We treat customers with respect and welcome them like family. We value training and skill development of our 
employees, and have internal consultants and counselors in place to guide service staff through every critical moment 
of contact they have with customers. We strive to deliver service in the utmost ‚Äúsincerity, patience, compassion and 
attentiveness.‚ÄùRefined Customer Service

ServicesInnovative Customer Service
In the era of mobility, cellphones have become an essential device that people use to connect to the 
world. Meanwhile, the demand for mobile service has increased significantly due to the introduction of 
4G technology. We value customer service as the most important factor in maintaining relations and trust, 
and the key to delivering higher customer experience. We started integrating voice applications into our 
customer service platform in 2016 and developed related technologies that help us quickly understand 
customers‚Äô problems and find solutions at a lesser cost.
‚Ä¢ Interactive voice response (IVR): Improvements were made to IVR not only to provide customers with 
brand new call experience, but also to help them find the services they need while reducing the time they 
spend listening to options. The system has so far completed its phase 1 functionality and stress test. It is 
expected to be launched by the end of 2017.
‚Ä¢ Voice recognition: The App is an important way for the Company to communicate with customers. To 
enhance customers‚Äô experience, the Company has so far completed a structure of the voice recognition 
system and is currently developing the required functions. In the future, customers simply need to speak 
to their phone to have the App present the requested information.
‚Ä¢ VOC and smart quality inspection: Chunghwa Telecom records and analyzes customers‚Äô calls to learn 
customers‚Äô real voice. Our focus in the beginning stage of development is to convert words, phrases, 
and sentences spoken by customers into texts, so that we may have a complete picture about what 
customers want and take steps to meet their expectations.
‚Ä¢ Text/SMS-based customer service bot: As mobile Internet grows popular, texting has emerged to 
become a new way to serve customers. A text bot offers the advantage of quickly gathering information 
from customers without having to worry about information leak.

Video of the eventEnsure Service Quality
Chunghwa Telecom makes ceaseless efforts to expand the volume and upgrade the quality of our 4G mobile 
communication system. We introduced advanced technologies such as Carrier Aggregation and Voice over LTE, which 
echo with the 900/1800/2600MHz base stations. This arrangement allows for the coverage of service from points, lines, 
and to planes for even more extensive and better quality mobile broadband network service.
Given upcoming demands for digital convergence and new digital lifestyles, Chunghwa Telecom has launched high-
speed fiber services at 300Mbps to satisfy users‚Äô need for high-speed applications. With this service, Taiwan has 
formally progressed from the megabit era to the gigabit era. In support of the government‚Äôs ‚ÄúDigital Convergence 
Program,‚Äù Chunghwa Telecom made the budget to invest NT$ 100 billion over many years, and had accomplished 
its goal to accumulate 7.2 million optic fiber users and 11 million wireless broadband users by 2015. To support the 
‚ÄúDIGI+2025‚Äù initiative introduced by the Executive Yuan, we expect to increase the coverage of 1Gbps network to 72% 
by the year 2020.
Wireless Internet Connectivity Aboard Public Transportation
By integrating 4G mobile network with Wi-Fi service, Chunghwa Telecom brings wireless Internet connectivity 
to public transportation, giving people more incentives to ride public transportation instead of personal cars 
and motorcycles. This solution not only contributes to the reduction of energy and carbon, but also solves 
traffic congestion as well.
Application on buses
Chunghwa Telecom has been collaborating with Hsinchu City Government to introduce ‚ÄúFree 4G Wi-Fi on 
Bus‚Äù by installing Mobile Wi-Fi kits on 20 buses including Hsin Chu Bus route number 1 and Champion 
Transportation routes number 50-53. This equipment has been integrated with iHsinchu to enable 
authentication for free wireless Internet service. Meanwhile, the Company also works with Taoyuan City 
Government to support the ‚ÄúUrban 4G Smart Broadband Application Subsidy Program‚Äù introduced by the 
Ministry of Economic Affairs, and has chosen 95 buses from 8 bus routes to provide free ‚Äú4G Wi-Fi‚Äù service. 
Commuters simply need to log in to ‚ÄúiTaoyuan or iTaiwan‚Äù to connect to the Internet for free.
Application on Taoyuan Metro
We will be providing complimentary Wi-Fi service on Taoyuan Metro. Currently, we have completed the  
installation of 84 Mobile Wi-Fi kits on 31 trains (including 20 commuter trains and 11 express trains). Once 
Taoyuan Metro begins operation, the commuters will be able to enjoy complimentary Wi-Fi service.
Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs 4G service may also be used for the safety of Taoyuan Metro. In-car images, for 
example, can be transmitted back to the Operational Control Center for real-time monitoring; furthermore, 
accidents can be quickly notified to facilitate timely rescue.
Application on High-Speed Rail
Chunghwa Telecom is currently conducting PoC tests with Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation and has 
Mobile Wi-Fi kits installed in two cars. We expect to commence service on all high-speed trains in 2017 
officially.Application on Taipei MRT
To improve the quality of Internet service, we have 
installed 870 public pay phones throughout 117 
Taipei MRT stations, and fitted 279 pay phones 
with Wi-Fi APs. In 2016, the MRT payphone Wi-Fi 
system received 18.55 million users, 28.79 million 
connections, and transmitted 102TB of data in total.
Marketing
ServicesWe have also supported the government‚Äôs initiative in promoting free wireless Internet services on a nationwide scale. 
With the availability of a reasonable Wi-Fi rental package, a robust user authentication platform and a nationwide 
maintenance/monitoring system, we have helped the government deploy free Wi-Fi hotspots all over the country. By the 
end of 2016, we have installed more than 55,000 public Wi-Fi hotspots, giving users access to stable, high-bandwidth 
and densely covered Wi-Fi service. 
In terms of social engagement, we have been working with local county/city governments to install hotspots and enable 
Internet access during festive occasions, such as the 120 hotspots installed for New Year‚Äôs Eve event and the 53 
hotspots installed for Lantern Festival. Overall, the Company had  spent more than NT$ 2.17 million in this regard.
We conduct a broad variety of satisfaction surveys to identify consumers‚Äô most concerned issues and expectations, 
and use these findings to guide our future improvements. 
After each survey, consumers‚Äô opinions and suggestions are conveyed promptly to product or business personnel 
(including Risk Management and Public Relations Departments) using the consumer feedback system. Furthermore, 
consumers‚Äô opinions are brought to the attention of the head of product and customer service departments, and 
discussed in monthly meetings to ensure that consumers‚Äô expectations are met.
Regarding the items belonging to the fourth quadrant (high importance and low performance) according to the results of 
the annual satisfaction survey, we will request relevant functional units to conduct further analysis and propose concrete 
improving measures annually. Also, there will be a follow-up keeping track of the condition of corrective actions next 
quarter.To make sure that consumers‚Äô needs are satisfied, we conduct customer satisfaction survey for Chunghwa Telecom 
service center, customer service hotline and installation & repair service every year so that we can provide the best 
possible service and continuous improvement on our services. In addition to regular consumer satisfaction survey 
conducted by the third party, we also accept NCC‚Äôs service quality survey on telecom carriers on a regular basis. The 
results show that our performance is significantly better than the  standard requested by NCC.Expand Wireless Hotspots

Services Sought to minimize the impact of disasters through prompt information communication service, Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs 
‚ÄúEmergency Response SMS System‚Äù sent out more than 320,000 SMS alerts in 2016. Its role in disaster prevention 
and notification is outstanding; in addition, a ‚ÄúPublic Warning System‚Äù (PWS) was established in support of the 
national policies. Between September and December 2016, the PWS was activated 4,367 times to disseminate 
messages concerning landslides, earthquakes, and roadblocks in various parts of Taiwan.
In 2016, we assisted the Ministry of National Defense and Nantou County Government in organizing the ‚ÄúAll-out 
Defense Mobilization Drill,‚Äù assisted Taipei City, New Taipei City, Taoyuan City and Keelung City Governments in the 
‚ÄúCoordinated Disaster Prevention and Rescue Drill,‚Äù and participated in the ‚ÄúNuclear Safety Drill No. 22‚Äù at Taiwan 
Power Company‚Äôs 3rd nuclear plant.Disaster Reporting and Upgraded SafetyEnhance Disaster Response and Communication Coverage
Chunghwa Telecom continues to install repeaters, backup wireless routers, and backup power supplies to increase 
transmission capacity in remote areas. By increasing the capacity of backup batteries to more than 72 hours, the 
Company ensures that residents in remote locations may stay connected even when the power supply is disrupted 
due to natural disasters.
Response 
MeasuresWe conduct annual rehearsals on a broad number of situations from coordinating network resources 
and equipment to emergency repairs. Our base stations have been deployed in a diversified manner 
and are covered by robust backup plans so that failure of circuitry, power or equipment at any base 
station would not disrupt another base station nearby.
Occurrence 
of DisasterIf communication is severely disrupted in the unfortunate event of natural disasters, we will take 
contingency measures (such as microwave radio, satellite transmission, portable base station, etc.) 
depending on the actual circumstances to maintain communication between the disaster locations 
and the outside world.
Special 
CasesAreas that are enclosed and accessible only through one road, such as Suhua Highway, are covered 
using multiple base stations so that even if one station were to be damaged due to natural disaster, 
other paired stations may still function and keep the area covered with signals. This arrangement 
has served its purpose in major accidents happened in the last two years, and kept the disaster area 
connected at all times.
Green Base Stations 
1.Green base stations:
A small percentage of base stations have been fitted with solar 
energy modules; some environmentally suitable base stations were 
upgraded with axial-flow fans and used natural air below 27¬∞C 
Celsius for cooling (free cooling). Currently, a total of 551 base 
stations use free cooling, saving 1.87 million kWh of power between 
2008 and 2016.
2.Renewable energy-powered base station: 
Chunghwa Telecom was the first in the industry to embrace green 
energy by installing solar power systems with 2 to 3 kW rated 
capacity at 6 of its base stations in 2008. This movement was made 
to experiment using solar energy to power base stations. By the end 
of 2016, Chunghwa Telecom had installed solar energy modules 
with 1 to 2 kW rated capacity for 10 base stations located in remote 
areas. These solar modules provide base stations with clean, 
carbon-less energy under normal circumstances, and can be used 
to power emergency communication if primary power is disrupted 
due to natural disasters.
Alleviate Public Concerns over Electromagnetic Waves
Research conducted by international organizations including WHO has found no conclusive scientific evidence 
regarding the harmful effect of electromagnetic waves on human health. Nevertheless, to eliminate customers‚Äô doubts, 
Chunghwa Telecom ensures strict compliance with the authority‚Äôs safety standards when constructing telecom 
infrastructures.
In 2016, Chunghwa Telecom was incurred NT$ 6.5 million of fines and administrative penalties on 13 counts of 
violation associated with base stations. These violations had occurred as we sought to address consumers‚Äô demand 
for ‚Äúgood reception‚Äù and concern towards ‚Äúnegative health impacts from base stations.‚Äù The Specific Absorption 
Rate (SAR) of all mobile communication products purchased have complied with the restrictions of the National 
Communications Commission (NCC). Given the scarcity of suitable base station locations and the need to assure 
consumers‚Äô rights to quality communication, the Company will strive to comply with regulations by taking precautions 
at different stages of installation.

Communication 
and 
Assessment 
PhaseAssess factors such as the size and concentration of population, radio coverage, and the number of customer 
complaints, the capacity of existing base stations nearby, and residents‚Äô tolerance towards a new base 
station. Once consent has been obtained from the building management board or residents, the Company 
may proceed to rent land and space for the construction of base stations.
Installation 
PhaseInformation of the proposed base station is submitted to NCC for review; installation may begin 
only if the proposal passes the review.
Pre-operation 
Phase‚Ä¢ Conduct emergency phone tests to pass NCC‚Äôs base station assessment tests that have been developed

‚Ä¢ All our base stations have been tested to exhibit power density that complies with standards.
After-
operation 
Phase ‚Ä¢ To prevent antennas from promising visual appearance, the Company will coordinate with other carriers to 
make coherent and integrated base station designs that conform to the overall environment. Doing so would 
minimize environmental impacts and facilitate more effective use of limited space.
‚Ä¢ The Company had completed visual improvements on 63% of base station antennas under ‚ÄúRegulations for 
Administration of Base Stations of Mobile Communications Network Businesses.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ The Legislative Yuan passed the ‚ÄúRecognize performance credit for offering state-owned building or land in

Advocate the Accurate Understanding
Chunghwa Telecom has been working closely with Taiwan Telecommunication Industry Development 
Association to convey to the public the correct information about electromagnetic waves, by organizing 
conferences and issuing promotional materials.
‚Ä¢ The Company joined NCC and 19 county/city governments nationwide to host 19 seminars on the topic of 
electromagnetic waves. 168 complimentary electromagnetic wave measurements have been completed 
to date; all results are compliant with government regulations.
‚Ä¢ Local government bodies were issued promotional materials and pamphlets on the knowledge of 
electromagnetic wave, which could be distributed to the public during various activities to promote proper 
understanding.

work rights, Chunghwa Telecom signs ‚Äúemployment contracts‚Äù with individual employees and notifies them of 
changes in terms of employment by Labor Standards Act. Furthermore, we exploit various communication channels 
including seminars and labor-management meetings to maintain a harmonious and mutually beneficial working 
relationship.
We have a ‚ÄúCompensation Committee‚Äù in place to ensure the competitive compensation for the best talents. In 
addition, the Company has a transparent system of sharing business performance with its employees. Compensations 
for the executive management have been standardized with details publicly disclosed in annual reports. The Company 
offers equal compensation for entry-level employees of the same grade. Those who possess relevant skills and work 
experience may have compensation evaluated based on educational background, career experience, expertise, and 
professional certification. Under no circumstances will the compensation be determined based on gender or racial 
differences. In 2016, we raised employees‚Äô salaries by an average of 0.81% and a maximum of 1.68% as a response to 
the government‚Äôs new employment policy, and to boost employees‚Äô morale against market competition.A Competitive Compensation System

total staff, while female managers accounted for 25.41% of total managers. To conform with the essence of Act of 
Gender Equality in Employment, the Company has outlined its sexual harassment prevention policy and established 
a ‚ÄúComplaint Investigation Committee‚Äù that specializes in handling employees‚Äô complaints regarding work-related 
discriminations and improper behaviors. The investigation committee has 5 members, with 3 female members. 
Because of  our effective control, no incident of discrimination was reported in 2016.
With regards to the diversity of manpower, we have been hiring persons with disabilities above the quota specified 
in Article 38 of Persons with Disabilities Rights Protection Act. In 2016, the number of persons with disabilities hired 
by the Company was 3.66 times more than the statutory quota (statutory quota: 212; actual hire: 795). As for the 41 
indigenous employees onboard in 2016, we fully respect their cultures, and therefore no violation of work rights or 
human rights was reported during the year.
Chunghwa Telecom is the only telecommunication carrier in Taiwan with 
union establishment; it has also signed a collective bargaining agreement 
with the union. This agreement covers an extensive range of issues from 
redundancy, reward, discipline, promotion, to health and safety. This initiative 
not only complies with local laws and international human rights conventions, 
but is also a show of our commitment to protect employees‚Äô interests. In 
addition to the union established by Chunghwa Telecom, employees have 
also assembled 11 other unions under the organization. In 2016, 99.86% of 
employees had attained union membership. A director seat has also been 
reserved for workers‚Äô representative, so that employees can more freely 
express their opinions.
We have open communication channels in place to make sure that employees‚Äô needs and suggestions are heard. Any 
violation or misconduct discovered at work can be reported to the relevant department using the channels provided. 
Chunghwa Telecom received no internal complaint regarding human rights issues in 2016.
We hold regular labor-management meetings to maintain active communications between employees and the 
employer. Employees and the employer each assign 9 representatives and take turns to chair the meeting. The 
Chairman and President of Chunghwa Telecom constantly engage with the union‚Äôs Chairman, Directors, and 
Supervisors in communication via meetings and telephone. The Chairman of Chunghwa Telecom Workers‚Äô Union is 
entitled to participate in disciplinary review meetings, performance appraisal meetings, and business report meetings 
to make sure that workers are kept up to date on news of the Company.
In 2016, the Company held 5 nationwide labor-management meetings and 1 extraordinary meeting, during which 
employees and the employer were able to reach consensus on many issues. Furthermore, the Company held 6 
coordination meetings to discuss terms of employment, including the removal of mandatory requirement to take the 
7-day special leave.Gender Equality and Diversity

a need to transfer a union member due to organizational changes (such as establishment, alteration, merger, and 
termination of department), the Company will arrange so only if necessary and will respect the member‚Äôs will. In 
addition, all transfers are bound to comply with the ‚ÄúFive Principles‚Äù stated in the Labor Standards Act.

CareValue Employee Training and Development
We adopt a business focus of ‚Äúcore competitiveness, professionalism, efficiency, and service‚Äù and seek to develop 
innovative talents through a combination of internal and external training.
We have a comprehensive training system to assist employees‚Äô development in all dimensions. The system 
incorporates ‚Äúneeds analysis‚Äù and ‚Äúin-depth planning‚Äù before a program begins, and follows up with performance 
assessment and review after a program ends. This systematic approach enhances employees‚Äô professional skills and 
work efficiency, and enables the Company to make better coordination of human resources.
Talent Development Strategies
Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs Telecommunication Training Institute has devised human resource development

«∂Alignment of training and business development    «∂Nurturing of managerial talents
«∂Professional training     «∂Digital and diverse learning
Social learning
Chunghwa Telecom has introduced an online learning social 
network (the Digital College) and an e-Learning approach, unlike 
the conventional classroom teaching. Instead of one-way teaching, 
the social network provides an environment where users may share 
and transfer knowledge at lower cost and yield better results. The 
broadband installation college, for example, is a platform where 
information such as technical documents, cases, video tutorial, 
and technical discussions can be exchanged and learned.
Online broadcast
Online broadcasts can be used to teach topics related to specific 
works. They are delivered over the internal UC platform, and offer 
employees a fast and convenient way to learn new knowledge and 
trends. Topics covered in 2016 included: new ICT technologies, 
big data applications and development, energy and carbon 
conservation trends, green energy, marketing information, and 
business administration. 113 training sessions were held to a total 
audience of 8,369.
Results
1.Information security certification
‚Ä¢ 4 employees obtained EC-CHFI certification and 32 employees obtained EC-CEH certification in 2015; 
after a series of focused training, these two numbers had increased to 26 and 39, respectively, in 2016.
2.Improved sales performance
‚Ä¢ Employees who underwent the 4G Service Talent Enhancement Program have shown near 15% 
improvement in sales performance. 
‚Ä¢ 52% of employees who underwent MOD and Fixed Network Specialist Training have exhibited 
improvement in sales performance at their respective service outlets. 
3.Enhanced professional skills
‚Ä¢ Employees who underwent 4G Network Quality Improvement Talent Program have exhibited 15% 
capacity improvement on average. 
4.New business potentials
‚Ä¢ The Company organized 31 courses to train facilitators, promoters, planners, designers, and maintenance 
workers for photovoltaic technology; these courses received a total of 867 enrollments.In order to sustain competitive advantage, Chunghwa 
Telecom has founded a ‚ÄúTelecommunication Training 
Institute‚Äù that specializes in training technical as well 
as managerial talents in the telecommunication field. 
Furthermore, a ‚ÄúTalent Development Team‚Äù has been 
convened by the President to conduct regular reviews 
on the planning and outcome of the Company‚Äôs training 
efforts, thereby making sure that the training programs are 
practical and closely aligned with operational policies.
The Institute currently offers 870 professional training 
courses in 18 categories including networking and 
marketing. It also has managerial courses available to 
enhance employees‚Äô technical as well as managerial 
capabilities. A total of 24,646 persons enrolled in 
professional training courses in 2016, while managerial 
courses were held to a total of 832 persons.
To meet organizational needs, personal interest and personality traits of employees, Telecommunication Training 
Institute provides a diversity of channels for leaning, to help employees develop their professional skills in depth 
and renew their management skills. These measures help to bring about growth and proper career development of 
employees.
Employees can receive training at the Telecommunication Training Institute during regular hours and in the evening 
or on holidays. Telecommunication Training Institute can also dispatch tutors to relevant business units for organizing 
training. We offer diversified learning channels: class teaching, distance education, digital learning, direct-broadcast 
courses, Digital College, tutor, take programs externally, and digital library.
The orientation is intended to provide newly recruited with a general understanding of the organization‚Äôs vision, 
values and culture that would help them adapt faster. In 2014, we established ‚ÄúNew Recruit Counseling Guidelines for 
Chunghwa Telecom and Subordinate Institutions‚Äù and introduced a counselor system along with digital learning tools 
to help shorten employee‚Äôs learning curve.Dedicated Training Units

Recruitment and Development of the New-Generation Talents
According to an internal manpower survey, Chunghwa Telecom will encounter a retirement wave of senior 
managers in 5 years. The following measures have been developed in response to the retirement wave and 
to resolve possible disruptions in the transfer of knowledge:
‚Ä¢ Engage Honghwa where necessary to fill in shortfalls of frontline staff.
‚Ä¢ Recruit additional talents for the R&D of IT, ICT and 4G technologies and to support business growth. 
Recruitment needs are to be approved on a case-by-case basis.
‚Ä¢ Nurturing the next-generation talents: The Company outlines talent-training programs on a yearly basis. It 
provides employees with professional and diverse training options, and certifies their skill development.
‚Ä¢ Emerging businesses: new ICT technologies are being integrated with knowledge in different fields, the 
Company will focus on training professional talents that can adapt and apply knowledge across different 
fields of expertise from cloud computing, big data, product packaging, to actual practices.Employee 
CareChunghwa Telecom is dedicated to providing employees with a diverse learning environment. In 2016, Chunghwa 
Telecom incurred more than NT$ 500 million in training expenses and trained employees for a total of 1.07 million 
hours. Meanwhile, we encourage employees to commit to life-long learning, offering as much as NT$ 30,000 of 
education subsidy per semester. 669 people had applied subsidies, and the Company compensated their efforts for 
NT$ 9.21 million.Nurturing of Professional TalentsChunghwa Telecom has instituted the ‚ÄúEmployees Performance Evaluation Guidelines‚Äù which apply to all employees 
to evaluate the performance of employees and develop the corporate culture where employees, customers, 
shareholders, and the Company are winners. For particular employees who are underperforming, the Company 
will give supervision to guide the corrective actions and keep track until improvement is made under appropriate 
procedures.
Chunghwa Telecom conducts performance appraisal in 3 different levels: entry-level staff, entry and mid-level 
managers, and senior managers. A performance appraisal involves a series of face-to-face discussions between 
employees and line managers at the beginning of a year to set personal goals, and at mid-year and year-end to 
evaluate employee‚Äôs contributions to the Company‚Äôs performance. During these sessions, managers would also 
discuss with employees about career plans and suggest courses that are relevant to their future careers. Performance 
bonus and employee remuneration are tied to employees‚Äô performances.Fair Assessment Mechanism
2016 Production and Sales Conference Discussion: IoT
The Telecommunication Training Institute has envisioned itself as a communication platform for ‚Äúproduction, 
sales and research‚Äù activities. By facilitating communications, it contributes to reducing the R&D cycle 
and ensures that production, sales and research activities are coordinated to meet customers‚Äô needs. The 
conference is where internal departments develop a preliminary understanding of product specifications, 
goals, and delivery time; these details are further revised based on interactions and feedback from 
customers to better conform with customers‚Äô expectations.
The 2016 IoT Production and Sales Conference had 114 participants. They were gathered to discuss IVS, 
iEN, eHome, ITS and platforms, which are the five key elements to developing IoT. The conference provides 
an opportunity for product, R&D and supervisory departments to exchange opinions and communicate in 
ways that contribute to the development and operation of IoT.2014 2015 2016

CareHealth Promotions for Senior Employees
A significant portion of Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs employees are aged 50 and above, which is why we consider 
health care an important issue, especially for senior employees. In 2016, we launched a series of health 
checkups and health management programs for senior employees. In addition to helping them develop 
physical capabilities, it was also part of our intentions to create a support system among friends.
1.Health checkups: The Company provided checkup services that were specifically targeted at senior 
employees, including carotid duplex and echocardiography for risk of ischemic stroke, coronary artery 
narrowing and incomplete closure of heart valve, and fundus photography for checking of macular 
degeneration, retinal vessel and glaucoma.
2.Health seminars: The Company invited Chief of Rehabilitation Medicine from Taiwan Adventist Hospital 
to host a seminar on ‚ÄúPrevention of Common Muscle and Bone Diseases for Office Workers,‚Äù which taught 
employees that human body functions degrade over time, and the importance of starting plan making to 
maintain physical health.
3.Participation in external events: Taipei City Government‚Äôs ‚Äú2016 Sports Frenzy‚Äù and INBODY program, 
that include analysis and explanations of body composition and introduction to stretching and aerobic 
exercises that can be performed at home and office; and Kaohsiung City Government‚Äôs ‚ÄúWalking Against

certificationOccupational Safety Competition 
The Company has established a set of ‚ÄúWork Safety Competition Guidelines‚Äù as an encouragement to 
complying with work safety and preventing accidents. Under the guidelines, accidents may include: 
1. Traffic accidents occurred while commuting, for which an occupational injury leave of one day or above 
has been taken.
2. Injury, death or damage from property suffered by employee or others while performing duties or caused 
by Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs facilities; and damage caused to Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs property while performing 
duties.
All employees on the roster at the end of December each year are reviewed by the occupational safety 
unit of the respective institution. Once the assessment results have been approved by the Occupational 
Safety Committee, employees will be rewarded for the level of safety they have exhibited, according to the 
terms of the work safety competition. Contesting departments are classified and grouped by work nature 
and headcount; if no accident occurs for an entire year, employees of that department are awarded prizes 
equivalent to the full value as an encouragement. For departments that encounter accident during the 
year, the value of prizes may be halved or waived entirely depending on the frequency and severity of the 
accident, as stated in the ‚ÄúWork Safety Competition Prize Standards.‚Äù In any case, no prize is awarded to the 
employee that causes the accident in the given year.Injury Rate (IR) = (Total number of injuries/Number of hours worked by all employees) x 200,000
Occupational Diseases Rate (ODR)= (Number of occupational diseases/Total work hours) x 200,000 
Lost Day Rate (LDR) = Total loss of work days * 200,000/Total work hours
Absentee Rate (AR) (Including personal and sick leaves) = (Total number of missed (absentee) days/Total number of 
workforce days) x 100%Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs ‚ÄúWork Accident Guidelines‚Äù contain detailed procedures for assessing occupational illness. 
Employees who are suspected to have suffered from occupational illness are assisted in applying for verification at the 
local municipal/county/city authority, in accordance with the Act for Protecting Worker of Occupational Accidents.
We manage risks at the source, making sure that construction risks are within control as early as in the design stage. 
The line construction management system has been added with remarks to highlight high-risk operations along with risk 
assessment information. The system was launched in March 2015, giving workers the effective means to identify risks 
and take precautions.
All high-risk operations are subject to approval. Workers are also required to take site pictures with handheld devices 
and upload them to the monitoring system, so that precautionary measures can be identified and taken to prevent falls, 
oxygen deficiency, etc. To promote employee‚Äôs awareness and skills on safety and health, we organized 208 training 
sessions and received 9,000 enrollments in 2016. The Company encountered 33 cases of occupational hazard in 2016; 
20 of which had occurred during work while 13 had occurred when commuting. The top 3 accidents were work-related 
injuries, traffic accidents while commuting, and falls. Main reasons of these accidents included: lack of attention to road 
conditions (neglect of incoming vehicles when turning or changing lanes), failure to maintain a safe distance (inability 
to respond in time), failure to give way, and lack of attention to the road surface. Employees are being reminded 
repeatedly during Occupational Safety and Health Committee meetings, work safety meetings and training sessions to 
exercise greater attention over personal safety and safe driving.Reducing Occupational Hazards

Cloud-based E-invoice
A business that prints 3.8 million sheets of digital invoice per month would be able to 
save 4,600 trees a year, and given the average carbon absorption capacity of 10-20 
kg per tree, the solution may reduce carbon by 90,000 kg a year. In 2016, Chunghwa 
Telecom had 283 customers using the digital invoice system, which generated annual 
revenues totaling NT$ 51.4 million.Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs cloud-based e-invoice service allows corporate customers to store invoices 
permanently in digital form on a cloud server for ease of filing. Meanwhile, printed copy of the digital invoice 
has been downsized to no larger than 5*8 cm, and only one sheet of paper is printed regardless of the 
number of items purchased. As a result, the amount of pulp used has been reduced to somewhere between 
1/3 and 1/4, which effectively reduces costs for businesses.Chunghwa Telecom Hostels provide accommodations for employees‚Äô business or leisure travel. In response to 
environmental protection and personal hygiene, the hostels do not provide disposal consumption goods and towels, 
and implement energy-saving measures such as solar water heater, air conditioning heat pump and LED lighting. 18 
hostels had been certified as Environmental Friendly Accommodation in 2016. 
In response to Hotel Carbon Measurement Initiative (HCMI 1.0) formulated by World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) 
and International Tourism Partnership (ITP), we introduced the ‚Äúcarbon footprint calculator of hotel rooms‚Äù in Siziwan 
hostel, along with the combination of iEN system to manage the use of facilities and electricity in the hostel. We also 
construct comprehensive power monitor and room management model to reach maximum energy and water saving 
efficiency.
Launched by world‚Äôs leading institutional investors, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) began issuing a series of 
questionnaires in 2003 to learn about the risk management practices and responding measures that businesses 
have in place with regards to carbon issues. In response to global institutional investors‚Äô interests on how Chunghwa 
Telecom discloses and reduces carbon, we have chosen to adopt the World Cafe Method since 2010, and we are now 
the only Taiwanese telecommunication carrier to have consecutively participated in CDP. We actively discuss across

EnterpriseTarget Low-carbon Industries and Promote Solar Energy
Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs venture into the energy industry has 3 focuses: solar energy, LED road lamp, and wind 
power. In terms of solar power, Chunghwa Telecom completed the construction of solar power systems at 
‚ÄúChengkung Telecom Tower and Anping Database‚Äù in 2016. Both installations have been recognized as 
Exemplary Sites under ‚ÄúTainan City Autonomous Regulation on Low-carbon City.‚Äù Both installations feature 
the use of Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs intelligent energy system (iEN), which enables real-time monitoring/analysis 
of power capacity, conversion efficiency, and reporting of abnormalities.
Business model:
‚Ä¢ Choose a suitable location for solar panel installation
‚Ä¢ Choose an installation service provider
‚Ä¢ Plan system capacity and engineering structure
‚Ä¢ Sign contract to sell electricity to Taiwan Power Company once power generation commences
Benefits:
‚Ä¢ Inject green electricity into Taiwan‚Äôs power system: The ‚ÄúChengkung Site‚Äù has a rated capacity of  65.52 
kWp and generates about 84,000 kWh per year; the ‚ÄúAnping Site‚Äù has a rated capacity of 43.68 kWp and 
generates about  56,000 kWh per year.
‚Ä¢ The creation of SOP panels allows solar power systems to be modularized to the needs of government 
agencies and private businesses in the future.
‚Ä¢ After deducting the cost of maintenance and equipment replacement, the solar power stations are expected 
to generate NT$ 150,000 in net profit over 20 years, which is equivalent to 7.28% annual return on investment.
Short-term plan: 
The Company will actively expand construction of solar power facilities, including proprietary and 
commissioned construction. The capacity of proprietary solar power plants is estimated to exceed 500 
kWp in 2017 and will contribute more than NT$ 1 billion in revenues.
Growing demand for telecom services has forced us to install additional equipment, 
which makes it rather difficult to control increases in the use of power. Nevertheless, we 
pursue different measures from the energy saving in our buildings as the starting point. 
Owing to a series of effective controls, we were able to reduce power consumption by 
305 million kWh (30.05%) by the end of 2016, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 
161,040 t-CO 2e compared to 2007. This effective control of power usage was achieved 
through a combination of enhanced environmental sustainability management system 
and closer monitoring of telecommunication equipment power usage.
Driven by its care towards environmental sustainability, Chunghwa Telecom actively 
supports the government‚Äôs Green Power Purchasing System by purchasing 2 million 
kWh of green electricity in 2015 followed by another 4 million kWh in 2016. These 
purchases placed us the first in the ICT industry and the second nationwide, for which 
we won ‚ÄúCorporate Vision Award‚Äù from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In the future, 
we shall carry on our determination in promoting renewable energy source and assist 
the government in the creation of green energy economy, thereby contribute to a three-
win concerning energy supply, industry development, and environmental protection.No.1 in Green Power Procurement
Green Energy 2G
Given the changing climate and energy shortage, the Taiwanese government began the ‚ÄúNational Energy 
Transformation Program‚Äù in 2016 that sought to bring new ideas on energy conservation, innovation, logistics, and 
intelligent systems. Solar energy is one of the key focuses of this program. Being the largest telecommunication 
carrier in Taiwan, Chunghwa Telecom recognizes its duty to support government policies and has made energy and 
carbon reduction as part of daily practices, with strategies and goals set up to guide our actions. We are also taking 
count of proprietary buildings that would be suitable for the construction of solar power system; furthermore, new IDC 
servers are being constructed preferably using renewable energy.
Chunghwa Telecom has been applying its long-accumulated ICT background into the construction of solar power 
stations for many years. By the end of 2016, the Company had 42 solar power stations throughout Taiwan with a total 
rated capacity of 419 kWp. We aim to expand capacity to 500 kWp by the end of 2017, and at the same time assist 
government agencies and private businesses in the coordination of photovoltaic projects.Air-conditioning

Electricity Consumption of IDCsChunghwa Telecom places great emphasis on the energy efficiency of our data centers, and is currently implementing 
energy conservation measures on telecommunication data centers (including IDCs). The Ankang Data Center, for 
example, obtained its green certification in 2013, while the cloud data center located in Banqiao was also certified for 
green building in 2016. All future data centers will be featuring our proprietary iEN smart energy management system, 
which is our scientific approach towards reducing energy, carbon and thereby protecting the environment. Energy 
conservation measures for telecommunication data centers include: Note. 1. The method of calculation was modified in 2016 to more efficiently present power usage. This modification 
resulted in a significant change in data under columns B-F , but total power usage had actually decreased 
compared to the previous year.
2. Data under columns E and F in 2016 will be presented in 2017 instead due to adjustment of calculation and

‚Ä¢ Rated LEED Gold and obtained Green Building and 
Smart Building certification in Taiwan.
Currently, Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs annual business growth is 2%; therefore, we benchmarking 2012 water usage 
standard, control the annual growth of water usage to no more than 2% and promote water-saving measures 
accordingly, including:
‚Ä¢ Install sink faucet sprayer to reduce water waste.
‚Ä¢ Replace toilets with dual-flush toilets to reduce flushing water.
‚Ä¢ Recycle rainwater for office plants watering.
‚Ä¢ Encourage the installation of water reclamation equipment in new buildings, so that the treated sewage water can 
be reused for non-potable and physical separated uses after reaching certain water quality standard.Note: The amount of water in 2015 had reduced significantly due to severe drought, which was believed to have been 
caused by climate change.
Water Resources Management
Water usage at Chunghwa Telecom is mostly for domestic 
purpose. Apart from bathroom use, air conditioner cooling 
accounts for another major water use. Given the ongoing 
increase in business activities and manpower, there is limited 
room for water reduction besides recovery of rainwater and 
cooling water.
We have identified water resources as part of our 
management focus, and introduced many initiatives to 
improve water efficiencies, such as water conservation 
measures, centralized water bill management, and water-
saving goals. Apart from adding a new water leakage 
detection feature, we have also incorporated water usage 
monitoring into our environmental sustainability system. 
Data collected from these two functions are analyzed and 
managed. Other conservation measures such as recycling 
and reuse of rainwater and domestic effluents are also being 
implemented on an on-going basis. Unit: ton

waterStarted from 2007, Chunghwa Telecom initiated water conservation measures by including water resources 
management into EARTH system, while registering centralized water bill payment through EARTH‚Äôs ‚Äúwater bill 
management‚Äù function to reduce printing of water bills. Through the information interface, managers can search, 
generate trend charts and report forms, provide exception reports to avoid mistakes in billing and meter reading. 
Managers can also review the situation of water uses, reduce expenses in water, and improve the efficiency of 
management.
We have scheduled a five-year plan to enhance the effectiveness of water recycling and reuse. In the plan, we are 
expected to establish underground raft foundation water collection systems to collect clean rainwater from rooftops 
and the ground. Meanwhile, we also initiated recycle of the cool-condensed water project for office air-conditioners. 
The recycling water will be reused for watering plants and cleaning the sidewalks.
Understanding the importance of resources reduction, recycle and 
reuse, Chunghwa Telecom combined our five-year environmental 
sustainability development plan and EARTH system to manage the 
use of resources and control energy efficiency, while conducting 
systematic management on recycled and waste treatment.
Chunghwa Telecom designated professional waste treatment 
company to transport our daily waste to landfills or incinerator for 
necessary treatment. For recyclable waste, the contracting cleaning 
company is designated for the classification and disposal treatment.
The scrapped lead-acid battery is a recyclable industrial waste regulated by the EPA. To reduce pollution, toxic 
substance and waste disposal is joint responsibility for the business organizations. In this regard, the recycling and 
disposal operations are outsourced by joint contract based public auction. The contractor must be a qualified service 
provider listed on the website of the Recycling Fund Management Board of the EPA to ensure legitimate management 
and disposal.
All the lead-acid batteries scrapped by each business unit are auctioned on site, and proper documents for 
their disposal are filed for audit tracking. There were 21,781 scrapped lead-acid batteries, sold for NT$ 18,177 
thousand with a total weight of 1,208,580 kg disposed in 2016. The public and private waste clearance and disposal 
organizations recognized by environmental institutions are designated to handle the treatment of other industrial 
waste such as cable and hardware miscellaneous.Waste ManagementRecycling of Water Resource

EnterpriseChunghwa Telecom prides itself as a highly-localized telecommunications carrier, a contributor to community 
development, and one of the most important partners to telecommunication carriers around the world. As 
technologies progress, we began to operate outside the conventional telecommunication boundaries and gradually 
incorporated corporate social responsibility concepts into product/service research, development, and application, 
and into the Company‚Äôs management strategies. For details regarding green products, please refer to p.52-53.
In addition to developing products that are friendly to the environment, we have actively been promoting Green 
Stores and was the first company in Taiwan to turn service outlets into Green Stores. We expect to convert all 406 
service centers into Green Stores by 2017, and sell more than 3 environmental/energy certified products. Information 
on future service outlets can be found at the ‚ÄúGreen Stores‚Äù section of the website of the Environmental Protection 
Administration, Executive Yuan.
Merger of Electronic Bills
Since 2001, we have been combining customers‚Äô bills and mailing multiple bills from the same address in one 
envelope, which not only makes billing easier for customers but also helps protect the environment. The Company 
introduced electronic bills in 2005, saving 420 million sheets of paper each year and was estimated to have saved 
38,027 trees, as 7,529 tons of carbon by the end of 2016. It was a good example of how the Company had satisfied 
customers‚Äô needs while at the same time contributed to the mitigation of global warming.Cross-industry Alliance and Low-carbon Transportation 
Chunghwa Telecom actively expands product diversity by utilizing its distribution advantage and forming 
alliances with partners from different industries. In view of rising environmental awareness and green energy 
trends, the Company has worked with China Motors since 2016 to sell e-Moving, a two-wheel vehicle, at all 
direct branches throughout Taiwan (excluding offshore islands). It shows our dedication to supporting low-
carbon vehicles with actions.
One of the most significant features about e-Moving is the simple charging solution. The biggest advantage 
it offers is energy efficiency, which has been well-recognized by the Chiayi Forest Bureau and courier 
companies. Due to the simplicity of its parts and design, e-Moving only requires changing of gear lubricants 
and costs only one-fifth the amount required to maintain a gasoline-powered motorcycle. Through its sales 
and service system, Chunghwa Telecom hopes to promote the use of green transportation and build a 
sustainable environment with the assistance of allied business partners.
Note:1. From 2014 onward, the calculation is based on the quantity of paper saved and reduction of carbon emissions 
after using e-Bills and combined bills.
2. Each electronic or combined bill saves 2.5 sheets of A4 paper on printing and envelope. Total amount of paper 
saved: 14,472,159 records * 12 months * 2.5 = 434,164 thousand sheets of paper.
3. One sheet of A4 paper generates 18 grams of CO 2; the amount of carbon emission reduced: 434,164,000 
sheets * 18 grams CO 2 = 7,815 tons CO 2.88%88%88%Ratio of customers applying

Green Procurement (‚ÄúGreen of ICT and Green by ICT‚Äù are Chunghwa Telecom‚Äôs responsibilities and missions as the leader in the 
telecommunication industry.
The trend towards green enterprises is contributed by 2 forces: ‚Äúmarket and non-market.‚Äù The non-market forces 
come from government regulations, whereas market forces come from supplier management. To co-exist with the 
environment, businesses must implement ‚Äúgreen practices‚Äù throughout the entire supply chain. Chunghwa Telecom 
has been implementing related measures since 2008, and at the end of 2016, we introduced our proprietary green 
product label and invited every supplier to apply for certification, so that we may ensure the use of energy-saving or 
green energy products throughout the supply chain, from raw materials, production to packaging.
The concept of a green supply chain is a win-win solution for businesses and suppliers, because it has the potential 
to increase revenues (financial advantage) and at the same time minimize risks and impacts on the environment 
(non-financial advantage). In the future, a green supply chain will be more than just having suppliers commit to 
environmental protection and introduce green products. Chunghwa Telecom will continue exploring value-added 
applications of ICT, and introduce robust systems to facilitate coordination, management and complete monitoring of 
its supply chain.
Chunghwa Telecom supports the government‚Äôs policies and makes budgets on an annual basis to purchase green 
products that are either environmental-certified (less polluting, recyclable, resource-saving or green materials) or 
self-declared to be of less environmental impact throughout the product lifecycle (from raw materials to disposal). 
The Company also actively participates in green procurement programs and activities in the hope of inspiring green 
purchases among the industry and the public.
Our goals and policies concerning green procurement have been explained in detail in the five-year plan mentioned 
above. We hope to maintain green purchases at more than 5% of the total purchases per year over the mid-term, and 
increase this percentage to more than 50% over the long term.Note: For information on supply chain management, please refer to p.44-49

Chunghwa Telecom worked with Suang Lien Foundation for the visually impaired to gather 200 secondhand 
iPhones. With the help of volunteers, these used iPhones were reset to factory settings and installed with 
VoiceOver, a software designed specifically for iPhones to assist visually impaired persons in communication.
In 2016, we recruited 57 volunteers to undergo the ‚ÄúVolunteer Training for iPhone Use by the Visually Impaired,‚Äù 
then organized 7 sessions of ‚ÄúiPhone Course for the Visually Impaired‚Äù and helped 120 visually impaired 
persons complete the course. The visually impaired persons who completed the training were given one used 
iPhone each, so that they may enjoy the convenience offered by smartphones.
We believe humanity to be the foundation of technology innovations. In 2013, we launched a ‚ÄúVoice-
based Personal Assistance App‚Äù that was specifically designed for the visually impaired. The app 
incorporates image, voice, reading, and lifestyle functions to assist the visually impaired and elders 
conquering many difficulties they encounter in life. By the end of 2016, the app received 15,373 
downloads, making it one of the most convenient and useful personal assistant to the visually impaired.
Results Achieved
Completed development of cloud-based image recognition technology, which helps visually impaired people 
recognize objects, texts, faces and landmarks through the use of a smartphone. Furthermore, by integrating the 
online broadcast features of National Education Radio, the Company can provide visually impaired persons with 
broader means of mobile learning, and help them solve problems encountered in life and improve their quality of 
life effectively.
A 4G-based smart guidance feature will be added to bring live video assistance and Beacon 
assistance to the visually impaired. Using 4G live video assistance, volunteers can see for the 
visually impaired and help them resolve problems such as shopping and reading without having 
to be physically present. The app and volunteers‚Äô assistance will enable visually impaired persons

skills of the phone customer service personnel in responding to the needs of the visually impaired.
‚Ä¢ In 2015, the Company completed an upgrade for Taipei City‚Äôs 1999 hotline, making it user-friendly to the visually 
impaired. This upgrade included: a real-time notification system, a three-way call feature with voice recording, 
English/Japanese services, the verbal abuse referral feature, a call duration reminder, a health regulation inquiry 
feature, and a quick link to service sub-categories. These upgrades were made to improve the scope and 
efficiency of services delivered by the customer service personnel.
‚Ä¢ By the end of 2016, the ‚ÄúTotal Solution‚Äù had provided 8 satisfaction surveyors for Chunghwa Telecom and 15 
customer service personnel for Taipei City‚Äôs 1999 hotline, who process more than 8,000 calls each month. One of 
the visually impaired surveyors had even passed the internal assessment and became the head of the customer 
phone service unit.
The automated voice donation system developed by Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories continues to prove helpful to 
charity, social welfare, cultural, educational, and environmental protection institutions, as it provides donors with a 
more convenient means of donations using cellphones, and has proven to raise more donations than conventional 
methods. Donors simply need to pick up their cellphones, dial the number and follow instructions as prompted by the 
voice system to contribute care to those in need. This service had raised NT$ 10 million in donations in 2016.
In 2013, the Company introduced a QR code-based mobile payment service that allows users 
to make donations more conveniently simply by scanning the appropriate QR Code. This 
feature enables funds to be raised through multiple channels other than convenience stores 
and websites, while at the same time reduces the manual work. From its initial launch to the

For the next decade, Chunghwa Telecom Foundation shall continue contributing to the sustainability of Taiwan‚Äôs 
communities, by utilizing its advantage in terms of digital technology, streaming service, culture and creativity. In 
2016, the Foundation invited world-class director Cheng-Sheng Lin to direct a documentary for its Digital Community 
program. The title of the documentary, ‚ÄúWitness the Promising Future,‚Äù truly captured the Foundation‚Äôs care for the 
local communities, and inspired the imagination to the promising future. Through the documentary, the Foundation 
hopes to present the strength of Taiwan‚Äôs society, and bring the unknown stories of people living in the far corners of 
the country that the Foundation had uncovered over the last decade to the viewers. The CHT Foundation

The CHT Foundation is conceived with the spirit of ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù and dedicated to ‚Äúnarrowing the digital divide,‚Äù  
‚Äúcreating digital opportunities,‚Äù ‚Äúassisting local industries,‚Äù ‚Äúcultivation of community life,‚Äù and ‚Äúkeeping local events 
on record‚Äù as the direction of its work. The foundation enters the communities from the cultural, industrial, living, and 
education aspects to share the growth with them.
The beauty of Taiwan lies in the 368 towns and districts that make up the nation. We believe each town and district 
is unique in its own way, which is why we respect the autonomy of our local offices and encourage them to take 
sustainable actions to the needs of residents. Due to resource constraints, it is our goal to maximize our influence by 
exploring needs first before committing resources.
Since 2006, the foundation has been utilizing the core advantages of Chunghwa Telecom to develop ‚ÄúDigital 
Community‚Äù throughout the nation including offshore islands. This program provides local communities with 
computer classrooms and open space of information to assist people who are willing but lack the resources to learn. 
Unlike one-time donations, ‚ÄúDigital Community‚Äù is a long-term program thoughtfully structured from early planning, 
equipment deployment, to maintenance.
Each Digital Community is assigned a different purpose; they may be designed to cater for children of disadvantaged 
families, or to develop local business activities, or to serve local religious organizations. We have accumulated 
abundant experience from our long-term engagement with the beneficiaries; for this reason, Chunghwa Telecom 
Foundation continues to organize Digital Communication Meeting on a regular basis to facilitate exchanges of 
experience between different project groups. The ‚ÄúField Trip‚Äù in 2016 took participants to the ‚ÄúManna Organic 
Culture Park,‚Äù a Digital Community located in Alisan, Chiayi, where they experienced the lives of locals through trips 
and workshops, and learned ways to improve the existing Digital Community program. By the end of 2016, we have 
established a total of 76 Digital Communities; our efforts will endure long into the future and become a part of the 
local communities.Digital Good Neighbors, New Cloud Vision

Pei-Chun Kuo from Tamkang University Department of Mass Communication had just 
completed a junior entrepreneur camp prior to participating in Click Taiwan. She had troubles 
blending into the tribe of indigenous people, and could only observe the local sports games 
from a distance. She began to wonder that ‚Äúperhaps Click Taiwan is not suitable for me.‚Äù 
However,  as the program progressed, she started to interact with the young locals and tried 
to dress up like them and joined them in songs and rituals. After experiencing their selfless 
and friendly culture, Kuo started to realize that ‚Äúmy purpose here is to record as much as I 
can.‚Äù At the end of the program, she thought to herself ≈à+UJQWNFDGOQTGITCVGHWNHQTYJCV+

During the Click Taiwan program, Yuan-Yu Huang from National Taiwan University of Science 
and Technology Department of Construction Engineering joined her partners to accompany 
children of the community in learning the history of design, making clothes out of leaves, 
experiencing creative architecture, and joining the elders in conversation and meals. During 
the program, she often heard elders complaining about how lonely they felt, and started 
thinking about the things her grandfather once said, ≈à6JGVJKPI+TGITGVVJGOQUVKUPQVDGKPI

touch. It is people who create stories and inspire emotions and motivations. Through Click 
Taiwan, Huang found the story that motivated her to capture the real moments in life, which 
she may inspire others to ‚Äúfeel, experience and think in introspection.‚ÄùYouth Training Scheme is a program organized by Chunghwa Telecom Foundation and Department of Radio & Television of 
National Chengchi University that encourages young adults to make real changes in life, step outside of the comfort zone to 
experience different things, to learn about themselves and the environment they grow up in through a different perspective. During 
summer vacations, university students were invited to provide service for 15-20 days at various Digital Communities. They were 
encouraged to apply what they learned in the local community and at the same time capture local stories on camera.
The 8th ‚ÄúYouth Training Scheme‚Äù program received entries from 50 university students, who were assigned to perform services 
and capture stories at Digital Communities. These students came from different backgrounds, schools and departments, and had 
devoted themselves to community services by contributing their own specialties such as storytelling, graffiti arts, creative crafts, 
photography tutoring, cooking lesson, elderly exercise, event recording, journalism and editing class, weaving/dyeing assistance, 
translation assistance, tour assistance, tribal family photo-taking, remodeling of old houses, and life exploration courses. In the 
meantime, they captured real and motivating stories through cameras.
The purpose of this program is to share with the public on how the young people see and perceive the stories around them, and 
in turn motivate others to re-think their connections with the environment and contribute to the local communities. In addition 
to touring photography exhibitions through campus and expanding the influence to young people, the program has also been 
extending its reach to distinctive coffee shops in Taiwan and presenting their interesting stories through the camera since 2016. 
It was a way to inspire young people to observe and appreciate local culture up close. Next, the National Library of Public 
Information joined as a new tour destination, and the Foundation invited Principal Ching-Chen Chen of Chang Hu Junior High and 
Elementary School of Ecology, renowned children‚Äôs book writer Arlene Hsing and world-renowned choreographer Bulareyaung 
to share their observations and opinions about the exhibition theme - ‚ÄúOur Stories.‚Äù The event received overwhelming responses, 
and saw visitors leaving comments such as: ‚ÄúThere are stories to be found every day in every corner of the world‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Every person 
who lives life to the fullest is truly extraordinary......,‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you for showing the sincere hearts of people around us through the 
perspectives of others......,‚Äù ‚ÄúThere are many exciting lives outside of the ones we live; thank you Click Taiwan for sharing the 
balance, purity, completeness, and meanings of life......‚ÄùSocial

The Foundation has long been dedicated to community care. 
In an attempt to increase the visibility of local businesses, the 
foundation once organized a series of events such as ‚ÄúMarket 
of Love‚Äù and festive gifts fairs to help market local products. 
In 2016, the foundation introduced ‚ÄúCloud Market,‚Äù a platform 
that integrates virtual with physical distribution channels to 
provide tribal communities with broader means to sell their 
products. The platform also gives employees the opportunity 
to approach local businesses up close, and offer them the 
most direct encouragement and support through action.
The Cloud Market was created with 4 main features: 
‚Äúenvironmental friendliness, direct sale, supporting small 
farmers, and social enterprise.‚Äù Partners of this platform 
consist mostly of the Foundation‚Äôs long-time ‚ÄúDigital 
Communities.‚Äù Products sold through Cloud Market include: 
high-altitude vegetables from Alishan (Chiayi), persimmon 
from Jianshi Township (Hsinchu), brown glutinous rice 
and vegetables from Pangcah Farm (Hualien), Qiansui 
Tofu Crackers made by Yunlin County Kouhu Township 
Senior Citizen‚Äôs Association, pastries made by volunteers 
of social enterprise Love-Family-One (Sanchong District, 
New Taipei City), and processed agricultural products from 
social enterprise Xingfu Shijian (Gaoshu Township, Pingtung 
County). Every order sold through Cloud Market carries the 
dreams of its maker, and by linking to the outside world, the 
foundation helps make dreams come true.The First Step to Knowing Quality Farmers -

Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L) is a way of evaluation of environmental impact from currency value and 
quantitative industries. Environmental cost and benefit of the value chain being affected by the corporate operation 
will be calculated in order to quantify the environmental externality into the monetary unit. In addition to the economic 
value, the environmental impact from the corporate operation should also be considered. In this way, it not only allows 
the stakeholders to understand the impact brought by the environment issues easily but also helps the corporates 
review their operation from a wider angle. The result can be used as the decision-making tool for risks or the supply 
chain management.
