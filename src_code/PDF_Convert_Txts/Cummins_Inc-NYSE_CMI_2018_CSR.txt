CUMMINS AND 
SUSTAINABILITY

POWERING
WORLDA MORE PROSPEROUSABOUT OUR  
SUSTAINABILITY  
REPORTING
Cummins’ sustainability reporting 
primarily consists of four postings 
to reach the right people with the 
right information at the right time. 
SUSTAINABILITY 
PROGRESS REPORT
This document is Cummins’ 2018 
Sustainability Progress Report, 
which reflects the company’s broad 
view of sustainability reporting, 
including the environment, corporate 
responsibility, healthy and safety, 
diversity and inclusion, innovation, 
financial performance and the 
company’s supply chain. 
As a signer of the United Nations’ 
Global Compact in 2017, Cummins 
supports the U.N.’s 17 Sustainable  
 Development Goals to “end  
poverty, protect the planet and 
ensure prosperity for all.” See the 
notations on page 7 of this report 
where the company believes its 
disclosures most closely align  
with those aspirations. 
The sustainability reporting  
team at Cummins has continued 
working to make this report shorter 
and easier to read, moving many 
feature stories formerly in the  
report to The Newsroom on 
cummins.com. You can find at  
least one sustainability related  
story there every week.  The team has also continued  
moving some data to our GRI Data 
Book, which can be found where  
we post all of our sustainability 
related documents. This report  
was completed in June 2019 and  
is Cummins’ 16th edition. 
CUMMINS GRI 
DATA BOOK 
The company is again producing a 
separate posting called Cummins’ 
2018 GRI Data Book. It follows 
the format of the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) established by  
the United Nations to develop  
a consistent way for companies  
to report on their environmental,  
social and economic performance. 
Cummins will disclose some 
additional data in the Cummins 
2018 GRI Data Book that didn’t fit 
the construct of the Sustainability 
Progress Report but is still important 
to disclose. The 2018 Cummins  
GRI Data Book will be posted by  
the end of June 2019. 
 
 
 CDP 
Cummins is committed to sharing its 
CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure 
Project) water and climate filings. 
The 2018 filings will be posted in 
Cummins’ sustainability document 
repository sometime in July 2019. 
The 2017 reports are available now. 
SUSTAINABILITY 
OVERVIEW 
Cummins has also put together 
another eight-panel sustainability 
brochure to give readers a very 
high-level look at the company’s 
sustainability efforts. The overview  
is posted with the company’s  
other sustainability related  
reports and documents in  
the document repository. 
ASSURANCE 
More than 90% of the data 
Cummins reports is assured by 
Bureau Veritas, a world leader in 
testing, inspection and certification 
services. Its complete assurance 
letter is included in the Cummins 
GRI Data Book.

WHAT SUCCESS 
MEANS AT  
CUMMINS
Success at Cummins starts with a  
strong bottom line. Our mission to  
make lives better by powering a more  
prosperous world requires much more.
It means creating a culture of innovation to  
ensure success in good times and bad, using  
fewer of the world’s resources to preserve and  
protect the environment, engaging to build 
stronger communities, embracing the power  
of diversity and inclusion, and establishing  
a global reach to maximize our impact.
As Cummins celebrates  
its 100th anniversary in  
2019, we’re working to  
make sure the company  
is powering prosperity  
for the next 100 years.Siemens sold more than 100 of 
its popular low-emission Charger

INTRODUCTION  // 4 NEXT PREVMATERIALITY
Cummins in 2018 worked with 
sustainability experts at Deloitte to help 
us ensure the company was prioritizing 
its reporting on the issues where the 
company has the biggest impact on the 
economy, society and the environment. 
Working together Cummins and Deloitte identified 
more than 20 key voices in and outside the 
company including non-governmental organizations 
impacted by Cummins, public officials, company 
leaders, board members, customers and agencies 
that rate and rank companies on sustainability.  
In addition, the partners polled more than  
1,000 employees for their opinions.
Deloitte compiled the feedback and included its 
own research on key issues facing the company as 
well as opinions about Cummins from social media 
and other sources.
The X axis includes impacts that are important to 
Cummins. The Y axis includes impacts that are 
important to stakeholders outside the company.
While the results were only available early in 2019, 
the company is moving quickly to address them, 
establishing a new section in the Sustainability 
Progress Report on the company’s supply chain. 
More changes are expected in future editions  
of the report. More on the methodology regarding  
the materiality matrix will be available in the 
Cummins 2018 GRI Data Book.

7 NEXT PREVA NOTE FROM  
THE CHAIRMAN 
We have a lot to celebrate at 
Cummins – our 100th anniversary 
in 2019, a record-setting 2018, 
and an almost unmatched history 
of sustainable corporate behavior. 
As we honor our past, we must also prepare for a 
future I believe will be more challenging than any 
period in the company’s history.
Growing the economy while using 
fewer of the world’s resources is 
the challenge of our time. I believe 
companies who become the best 
at using less will be the most 
successful. Increasingly, customers 
are demanding not just dependable 
power at a fair price, but power 
emitting fewer greenhouse gases 
that contribute to climate change. 
They want supply chains that treat 
people fairly and promote justice. 
While these challenges are  
great, I know we can meet them. 
Record revenues in 2018, for  
example, enabled Cummins to  
invest $902 million into research  and development, a record amount.  
The company will continue developing 
our electrification and hybrid power 
capabilities and evaluating other 
promising technologies including fuel 
cells while advancing our diesel and 
natural gas engines. 
Technology is changing more  
quickly than any time in my more 
than 25 years at Cummins. Our  
use of high technology modeling  
and optimization tools enables  
our company to design lighter and 
more efficient products without 
sacrificing power or durability.  
We are developing software and 
controls to keep vehicles running at optimal levels, delivering efficiencies 
across the entire powertrain.  
This success has contributed to an 
increasing share and greater financial 
success in many of our key markets.
Cummins also continued reducing 
its carbon footprint in 2018 as part 
of the company’s goal to use less 
energy and water while reducing 
waste. One way we addressed our 
goal to promote renewable energy 
was by entering into an innovative 
agreement in 2018 to help a 
northwest Indiana wind farm  
expand. It will send more renewable 
power to the grid than Cummins 
uses at its facilities across our 
headquarters state.
Finally, Cummins took steps in  
2018 to create the right work 
environment for future global 
success. Our updated Mission, 
Vision and Values focuses on 
increasing prosperity around the 
world, including the well-being of 
our environment. Our Human Rights 
Policy, rolled out in 2018, targets 
human trafficking and child labor. The company’s new Cummins 
Powers Women initiative works  
with non-profit groups to improve 
the lives of women and girls in every 
part of the world.
I believe these steps create the 
foundation for achieving the more 
prosperous world described in our 
mission. We want our company  
to be just as successful in the next 
100 years as it was in its first 100.
Thank you for your interest  
in Cummins,

SEGMENT
The Engine segment manufactures 
and markets diesel and natural gas 
engines for on- and off-highway use 
around the world. Markets include 
heavy and medium-duty trucks, 
buses, light-duty trucks and areas 
such as agriculture, construction 
and military equipment.
POWER  
SYSTEMS
In 2016, Cummins reorganized its 
business, combining the company’s 
Power Generation segment and its 
high-horsepower engine business 
to create a new Power Systems 
segment. The segment is a global 
provider of power generation systems, 
components, and services in standby 
power, distributed power generation, 
as well as auxiliary power in mobile 
applications. The segment also 
designs, manufactures, sells and 
supports diesel and natural gas  
high horsepower engines for a  
wide variety of uses.
 
  
 
 
COMPONENTS
The Components segment  
is organized around the  
following businesses:
 »CUMMINS EMISSION SOLUTIONS 
designs and builds exhaust 
aftertreatment solutions to  
reduce engine emissions.
 »CUMMINS FILTRATION designs  
and builds heavy-duty air, fuel, 
hydraulic and lube filtration, and 
chemical and exhaust system 
technology products.
 »CUMMINS FUEL SYSTEMS designs 
and manufactures fuel systems that 
maximize power and fuel economy 
while helping to reduce emissions. 
 »CUMMINS TURBO TECHNOLOGIES 
designs and builds turbochargers  
to maximize engine performance 
and reduce emissions and  
fuel consumption.DISTRIBUTION 
The Distribution segment sells and 
services the full range of Cummins 
products for over 20 applications 
in more than 190 countries and 
territories around the world.
ELECTRIFIED 
POWER
Cummins established its  
Electrified Power segment in early 
2018. The segment will provide  
the full range of electrified power 
solutions as well as some of the  
most critical components that have  
the largest impact on performance, 
quality and power. The segment 
posted its results as part of  
Cummins’ first quarter earnings  
in 2018.HOW WE  
DO IT
For almost 20 years  
Cummins was organized  
into four business segments.  
Then, in 2018, the company 
established the Electrified  
Power segment to develop  
electric powertrains and  
related components.

SIX SIGMA AND  
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
Cummins is a big proponent  
of Six Sigma, using the 
business improvement tool 
to save the company and its 
customers billions of dollars.
Six Sigma uses data-based analysis to  
identify defects and variation in a wide range of manufacturing and  
business situations. Cummins employees also use Six Sigma when  
working with community partners on Corporate Responsibility projects.  
Here are some key metrics: 
 »15,110 current employees have been trained on  
Six Sigma common tools, including 14,554 exempt  
(not represented by a union) employees who are  
trained to lead Six Sigma projects with common 
continuous improvement methodologies. 
 »3,495 current employees took Six Sigma training in 2018. 
 »Six Sigma projects have identified an estimated  
$7.11 billion in Profit Before Interest and Taxes (PBIT) 
savings since the tool was first implemented in 2000, 
including $265.1 million in 2018. 
 »Cummins customers have saved an estimated  
$1.55 billion through Six Sigma since the tool was first 
offered to them in 2005, including $104 million in 2018. The tool’s impact, however, goes 
beyond cost savings and community 
engagement. It provides Cummins 
with a common language and 
collective mindset across the 
globe that can be used to address 
a problem or challenge almost 
anywhere in the world.
The most impactful projects are 
honored as part of the company’s 
Impact Awards. As a continuous 
improvement company, Cummins 
is committed to providing great 
employees with the tools they 
need to solve the most important 
challenges in the business, and to 
recognize the outstanding work 
they do. Six Sigma has been widely 
credited with helping turn Cummins 
into the vibrant and innovative 
company it is today.
After 18 years as a key part 
of Cummins, Six Sigma has 
established itself as the principal 
problem-solving tool used at  
the company.CUMMINS OPERATING SYSTEM

TWO GOALS, BUT 
CHALLENGES REMAIN
Five years after announcing its first global 
environmental sustainability plan, Cummins has 
surpassed the carbon dioxide (CO2 ) savings it 
expected to achieve by 2020 through partnering 
with customers on fuel economy projects, 
avoiding 12 million metric tons of CO2.
The company has also met its  
2020 water reduction target,  
a goal that was increased just a 
few years after Cummins’ global 
environmental sustainability plan  
was announced in 2014.Cummins also made a significant  
step forward in its goal to use and 
promote renewable sources of 
energy. A northwest Indiana wind farm 
expansion the company is supporting 
through a virtual power purchase 
agreement went on line in  December 2018. It is now producing 
as much energy as Cummins uses 
at all of its facilities in its headquarters 
state of Indiana.
Challenges remain, however, 
especially in mature areas such as 
energy, where achieving the last few 
incremental improvements toward 
Cummins’ 2020 goal has been harder 
to achieve. The company’s recycling 
goal, meanwhile, has been hindered 
by regulatory barriers in some 
countries and the absence of waste 
management suppliers in others.
Nevertheless, given the ingenuity  
and hard work of more than  
62,000 employees around the  
world, the company is confident  
it will meet its 2020 goals. 
In the ensuing pages, please see  
a goal by goal update on Cummins’ 
progress in 2018.FUTURE FOCUSED ON  
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
Cummins is planning  
to announce the  
next generation of its 
environmental sustainability 
plan as part of the company’s 
100th anniversary later in 
2019, while still working  
to achieve its existing  
2020 goals.
The plan will look out to 2050, setting quantifiable goals  
for 2030 along a glide path to its longer-term aspirations.  
Through the new plan, the company wants to: 
01 Drive innovative technologies and partnerships to 
address clean air and climate change in line with  
climate science.
02 Design out waste, ensuring materials are used for the 
longest time possible at their highest value and are 
repurposed for their next use, including end of life. 
03 Only use water that is readily available, and continually 
reuse and return clean water to the communities where 
Cummins does business. 
04 Partner to provide sustainable solutions and drive 
outcomes to environmental challenges in Cummins’ 
communities with a near zero local environmental

USE STRATEGY 
Greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from Cummins 
products in use are 
the company’s largest 
environmental impact and 
represent an estimated  
99% of Cummins’ GHG 
footprint due to fossil fuel use.  
Cummins’ biggest  
opportunity to expand  
product stewardship beyond 
the upfront design of its 
products is in working with 
customers to improve the 
efficiency of the company’s 
products in use and ensuring 
customers have the latest 
tools to improve fuel efficiency.  
Cummins wants to cut CO2 
emissions by 23 million metric 
tons, saving customers up to 
$9 billion through greater fuel 
efficiency by the end of 2020. 
Cummins expects to work  
with about 20% of its 
customer base, touching 
nearly 2 million engines, as  
it tailors engine specifications 
to customer applications. Cummins fuel teams throughout the 
world implemented 76 new products in 
use projects in 2018, bringing the total 
number of initiatives with customers 
since 2014 to close to 300. The 
company surpassed its 2020 goal of 
achieving an annual run rate reduction 
of 3.5 million metric tons of CO2. The 
2018 rate was 4.3 million metric tons. 
Performance in 2018 built on global 
momentum, with the launching of 
new initiatives, better fuel economy 
improvements and an increase in 
Distribution segment projects.  
Global fuel economy teams have been 
building functional capability via fuel 
economy forums, training and tools. Cummins estimates that the lifetime 
emissions of its products sold in 2018 
is 809 million metric tons of CO2.  
The company’s data is modeled  
using overall volumes by segment  
and engine model sold in a given  
year and by determining the volumes  
in operation each year using the  
long-standing Cummins New and 
ReCon Parts proprietary parts 
consumption model and customer 
engineering analysis. 
Yearly miles per gallon or gallons  
per hour are converted to million

17 NEXT PREVWATER STRATEGY 
The goals of Cummins’ 
comprehensive water strategy, 
which addresses both direct 
water use and community 
engagement, are to mitigate 
business risk, to be a good 
global citizen and to reduce 
costs and compliance risk. 
These goals are consistent  
with the core commitments 
of the CEO Water Mandate, 
the U.N. Global Compact’s 
commitment platform for 
business leaders and learners  
to advance water stewardship. 
To achieve the company’s 50% 
water intensity reduction goal, 
Cummins will expand the work 
it does with its sites in a water 
management program, including 
support of regenerative test 
cell projects using less water, 
intensive engagement with 
higher water use locations,  
water balance studies and 
strategic capital funding for  
water reduction projects. 
Cummins’ strategy also identifies 
the critical role water plays in 
the company’s supply chain. 
Cummins is beginning to  
work with suppliers to help  
them develop less water 
intensive techniques. In 2018, Cummins achieved a  
50% reduction in water intensity 
(water use adjusted for hours worked) 
compared to the company’s baseline 
year of 2010. A key challenge will 
be maintaining this performance 
level while continuing to expand, or 
balancing any downturn in production. 
Cummins used 950 million gallons 
of water in 2018, a 14 million gallon 
decrease from 2017 and a 22 million 
gallon decrease since the company 
initiated its water strategy in 2014. Since the goal’s baseline year of  
2010, direct water use is down by 
16%, while water use adjusted for 
hours worked has been reduced to 
the 2020 goal of 50% – all despite 
an increase in the number of facilities 
during that time period.  
Cummins’ water neutrality work is  
also progressing. Eight sites have  
been validated as water neutral  
toward the company’s 2020 goal of 
15. These locations are off-setting 
their water use with community improvements that either conserve 
water or make new sources available. 
A risk analysis and mapping exercise 
of the company’s top 200 suppliers, 
completed in 2016 by Verisk 
Maplecroft, has helped Cummins 
better understand water risk in its 
supply chain.

STRATEGY
Cummins continues to use 
a facility investment plan 
approach, with a focus on 
test cell energy recovery 
and investments in on-site 
renewable projects to offset 
electricity purchased from the 
grid. The testing of engines  
is a significant energy use  
at Cummins. 
Ongoing site projects include  
“smart” lighting and 
improvements to building 
exteriors, and heating and 
cooling systems. Aggregated 
savings from energy efficiency 
efforts total about $55 million 
per year. 
Cummins uses tools and 
resources available from 
programs such as ISO 50001, 
the international energy 
management system standard, 
and the U.S. Department of 
Energy’s Superior Energy 
Performance (SEP) program.  
The company plans to  
implement ISO 50001  
at 40 sites, or 90% of its 
carbon footprint, by 2020. 
Thirty-six sites have been 
certified through 2018,  
with nine also certified  
to the SEP program. Cummins invested $15 million in  
140 energy efficiency and onsite solar 
photovoltaic capital projects during 
2018, towards achieving its energy  
and greenhouse gas (GHG) goals  
with projected cost savings of  
$5.2 million per year. 
Global campaigns were launched 
for LED lighting and compressed 
air efficiency to develop and deploy 
common solutions for common 
opportunities. Total energy costs in 
2018 were approximately $150 million 
or about 7% of Cummins’ net income.  
At the end of 2018, Cummins’ energy 
intensity reduction of 29% was slightly 
off pace of its goal of 32% by 2020. A recovery plan was implemented 
for 2019, increasing investment 
going forward to $27 million and 
implementing low cost/no cost 
reduction targets for all global facilities 
to reach the company’s goal. 
Over the same 2010 to 2018  
time-period, the company’s energy 
efficiency and renewable energy  
efforts have reduced Cummins’  
GHG intensity by 37%.   
The company’s GHG emissions 
increased by about 30,500 tons on 
an absolute basis in 2018, but fell 6% 
adjusted for hours worked compared 
to the prior year.  Cummins’ primary 
energy consumption increased by  5% on an absolute basis while falling 
by 4.8% adjusted for hours worked 
compared to 2017.     
The company’s Environmental 
Champion program trained  
183 employees from all global  
regions to look for ways Cummins  
can reduce its impact on the 
environment. This training  
ensures that the company’s global 
environmental and facility leaders  
have the skills, tools, best practices 
and network connections needed  
to effectively manage energy,  
water and waste.

WIND POWER 
Cummins’ 2020 energy goal 
includes a commitment to increase 
the amount of energy sourced from 
renewable power. Construction on 
the Meadow Lake VI wind farm in 
northwest Indiana was completed 
and began generating renewable 
electricity in December 2018.
This wind farm expansion was  
made possible through Cummins’ 
15-year virtual power purchase 
agreement (VPPA) for 75 MW 
capacity, which will generate about 
as much electricity as the company 
uses in Indiana and about 28% of 
the company’s global electricity load.  
The power will go to the grid and  
not directly to any Cummins facility. 
Nevertheless, it amounts to a  
20% reduction in the company’s 
carbon footprint (approximately 
165,000 metric tons carbon 
dioxide equivalent per year).  
While the VPPA will reduce 
Cummins’ future carbon footprint,  
it will not benefit the company’s 
energy intensity performance.  
This is because Cummins uses 
different reporting protocols for its 
energy and GHG metrics, and the 
protocols treat offsite renewable 
energy projects differently.  
Cummins uses the U.S. Department 
of Energy’s Energy Intensity 
Baselining and Tracking Guidance 
for the Better Buildings, Better 
Plants Program for its energy 
metrics, and it follows the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Standard for 
carbon intensity metrics. 
A case study documenting the 
Cummins VPPA was published 
by the Rocky Mountain Institute’s Business Renewables Center. 
ENERGY AND  
GHG GOAL (Cont.)
WHAT ABOUT 
SOLAR? 
Cummins has installed  
13 solar photovoltaic (PV) 
systems at facilities around 
the world, which currently 
generate 1.4% of the 
company’s global electric load. 
More than 20 new installations 
are planned for 2019, which 
will more than double the 
company’s PV capacity. 
Fourteen installations will  
be in India, where solar 
intensity is high, and power 
from the grid is carbon-

20 NEXT PREVWASTE  
STRATEGY
The company follows a 
waste management hierarchy 
consistent with current industry 
standards: avoid the generation 
of waste, reuse, recycle and 
recover energy from waste. 
Reducing packaging is one  
key way Cummins avoids  
the generation of waste. 
Reusing waste might involve 
reusing pallets or finding an 
alternative use without any 
reprocessing. Recovery and 
reuse of coolants and solvents 
is still another example. 
The company’s ultimate goal is 
“Zero Disposal” at 30 Cummins 
facilities by 2020. There are 
currently 15 validated Zero 
Disposal sites toward this goal.
Under Cummins’ definition of 
Zero Disposal, waste can only 
be burned as a last resort to 
create energy and then only 
if there’s a net energy gain, 
creating more energy than is 
needed to sustain combustion. Cummins in 2018 recycled  
90% of the total waste the company 
generated over the year, equivalent 
to approximately 203,000 metric 
tons. The recycling rate has been 
flat in the past two years due to 
regulatory barriers in regions like 
India and China, problematic waste 
streams such as foundry foamwork 
and filter media, and an absence  
of waste management suppliers  
in some operating regions such  
as Africa.  
In addition, Cummins has been 
reducing packaging waste globally 
by increasing its use of returnable 
and reusable packaging. The 
company knows moving up the 
waste hierarchy from recycling to 
reduction is the right thing to do. However, this move negatively 
impacts the recycling rate as most 
corrugated and wood packaging 
that is now reduced are easy to 
recycle in most operating regions.  
Cummins is currently working on 
high impact projects including 
implementation of total waste 
management suppliers, contracts 
with new recycling and recovery 
suppliers in North America, Latin 
America and Asia Pacific, to boost 
performance significantly to achieve 
the 2020 goals.  
Since the company’s baseline year 
of 2010, Cummins’ total waste 
disposal increased by about 5.7% in 
absolute terms, while experiencing a 
37.4% reduction in disposal adjusted  
 for hours worked. Compared 
with 2017, Cummins’ total waste 
disposed in 2018 increased by 
2,981 metric tons or 14.5%  
on an absolute basis and by  
3.6% adjusted for hours worked. 
Cummins is also committed  
to avoiding the generation of 
hazardous waste and properly 
handling hazardous materials in  
the workplace. The definition of  
what constitutes hazardous waste 
varies widely by country. Cummins 
follows all applicable local and 
regional regulations. For U.S. sites 
that generate hazardous waste,  
the company has a formal supplier 
pre-qualification process to ensure 
such waste is handled properly.

21 NEXT PREVLOGISTICS 
STRATEGY 
By meeting the company’s 
logistics goal, Cummins  
aims to create and maintain  
an efficient transportation 
network that reduces CO2 
emissions by improving 
transport planning to maximize 
loads, reduce miles when 
trucks are empty and  
minimize distance traveled. In mid-2017, Cummins transitioned 
all North American transportation 
management (shipments within  
the Cummins network) to one  
third-party logistics company.  
A proposal for a third-party logistics 
provider outside the U.S. was 
paused during some warehousing 
and organizational changes, after 
which the logistics providers will be 
evaluated. Currently, the company is 
not evaluating data outside the U.S. 
against its goal.  
The logistics team has been working 
to better understand the increased 
amount of detailed data it receives 
from the company’s new vendor and 
has launched a Six Sigma project in 
early 2019. The project targets the 
high CO2 routes where Cummins 
can make changes to the way it 
ships material and reduce CO2.  
The company is also looking for a way to correlate high and low 
volume months to CO2 emissions.  
The transportation management 
team focuses on inefficient routes by 
pre-planning loads allowing them to 
combine shipments and reduce the 
number of lightweight loads. 
So far in 2019, the company has 
been able to increase truckload 
weights by 5%, thus decreasing  
CO2 emissions per pound.  
While 2018 year-end data shows 
negative progress, intra-year 
point in time measurements show 
positive improvement. The logistics 
team is working toward making 
improvements that would smooth 
CO2 reductions throughout the year. 
Also in 2019, a Six Sigma team 
has begun to concentrate on CO2 
emission reporting in Europe.

TARGETS
In 2017, Cummins signed  
on to the Science Based 
Targets Initiative (SBTi),  
which uses environmental 
science to support companies 
with setting GHG reduction 
targets consistent with limiting 
global warming to 2 degrees 
Celsius or lower. 
Cummins carefully considered 
the recommendations of the 
October 2018 International 
Panel on Climate Change’s 
report in calculating its 
proposed targets. The 
company’s commitment will 
apply to its next product  
in use and facility energy/  
GHG reduction targets to  
be announced in 2019.
Cummins’ three energy/ 
GHG reduction goals 
(including the current one  
with a goal completion year  
of 2020) have used the 
principles and data of science-
based target setting while not 
officially part of the initiative.

23 NEXT PREVPARTNERING TO SOLVE 
COMPLEX PROBLEMS 
Cummins’ partnerships and its policy advocacy play key roles  
in the company’s environmental strategy and performance. 
They help Cummins meet product 
emission goals, use energy more 
efficiently and bring environmental 
solutions to the marketplace. Four 
of the company’s 10 environmental 
sustainability principles focus on 
partnerships with legislative and 
regulatory entities to develop  
sound public policy. They are: 
 »Help develop responsible 
regulations. 
 »Promote technology development.  
 »Advocate for incentives  
to accelerate progress.  
 »Support a balanced  
global approach.  
Cummins has a long history of 
demonstrating its leadership in 
developing the technologies needed 
to meet tough emissions standards 
and improve fuel efficiency.
Emissions regulations are expected 
to continue getting tighter globally  and the new frontier is around 
greenhouse gas (GHG) standards 
and local governments establishing 
emissions requirements.  
Phase 2 for U.S. GHG/fuel efficiency 
regulations passed in 2016 include 
separate engine standards. 
Cummins continues to support  
this regulation and in 2017  
worked to implement it in  
company products. The first  
phase goes into effect in 2021.  
Cummins is also advocating for 
separate engine standards around 
the world as other regions consider 
GHG regulations. And the company 
continues working to achieve lower 
levels of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) 
and particulate matter (PM) in its 
product emissions globally. 
Over the next five years, India, 
China, Mexico, Brazil and other 
countries are expected to move 
to the very low emissions levels contained in the Euro VI and  
EPA 2010 emissions standards  
for on-highway products. 
This is both a challenge and a 
significant step forward — the 
number of people living in markets 
regulated at these more stringent 
levels will increase from 1 billion 
today to more than 3 billion.  
In the U.S., Cummins is  
committed to working with both  
the Environmental Protection  
Agency (EPA) and the California  
Air Resources Board (ARB) to 
maintain a national, heavy-duty  
NOx and GHG program. 
In 2018, the company certified  
144 engine models among  
15 governing agencies around  
the world to 36 different emissions 
standards for its diesel and natural 
gas products for on-highway,  
off-highway, marine and  
locomotive applications.TRACKING 
COMPLIANCE 
AROUND THE 
WORLD
Cummins’ Product Certification 
and Compliance group tracks and 
reports on emissions compliance 
developments in cities, territories 
and the following major regions: 
Africa, east Asia, greater Europe, 
India, Latin America, the Middle 
East, North America, northeast  
Asia, southeast Asia, Russia  
and the South Pacific. 
Over the next five years, Cummins 
will adapt to common and regional 
variations of on-highway standards 
that will continue to drive emissions 
reductions in eight of these  
11 regions. 
For facility compliance, Cummins  
in 2018 implemented its global  
Legal Compliance External Audit 
Program, which requires each  
region at the company to select 
an external vendor to conduct 
compliance audits at its sites. 
This program is implemented using 
a common audit methodology to 
drive effective, transparent and 
consistent compliance assessment 
across regions. In parallel, the 
company uses legal compliance 
software to enable full knowledge 
of compliance obligations and track 
any issues until resolved.

COALITIONS  
AND COUNCILS  
Cummins is a member of several organizations 
that promote sustainability and responsible 
technology, including: 
 »The DIESEL TECHNOLOGY FORUM, 
which is dedicated to raising 
awareness about the importance 
of clean diesel engines, fuel and 
technology. Since its founding in 
2000, the forum has emerged as 
a leading source of information  
on agriculture, economics,  
energy, the environment, 
transportation and trade issues 
impacting diesel technology.  
 »The HEALTH EFFECTS INSTITUTE,  
a non-partisan organization 
founded by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency and industry 
leaders, including Cummins, to 
provide high quality, impartial,  
and relevant science regarding the 
effects of air pollution on health.   »BSR (formerly Business for Social Responsibility), which works  
with member companies to develop sustainable business strategies  
through research and cross-sector collaboration.  
 »The ROCKY MOUNTAIN INSTITUTE’S BUSINESS RENEWABLES CENTER,  
a member-based platform that works to streamline and accelerate 
corporate procurement of off-site, utility-scale wind and solar energy. 
 » The INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL ON CLEAN TRANSPORTATION (ICCT),  
whose mission is to improve the environmental performance and energy 
efficiency of road, marine and air transportation to benefit public health  
and mitigate climate change through research, technical and scientific 
analysis. In 2017, Cummins joined ICCT’s soot-free urban bus fleet  
initiative to expand deployment of soot-free engines in large cities  
in countries without rigorous emissions regulations. The initiative  
brought together companies that manufacture buses and suppliers  
of commercially available soot-free engines with city officials.  
In 2018, Cummins produced 43,802 soot-free engines.Staff members with the Health Effects 
Institute meet with Cummins employees 
in 2019 to discuss key air quality trends.
A TRUSTED SOURCE  
OF KNOWLEDGE 
The Health Effects Institute (HEI) provides high-quality, trusted 
science for cleaner air and better health so companies can 
spend more time innovating and advocating and less time 
arguing about how research is conducted. 
Through HEI, Cummins  
can have input on the health 
effects research over the next 
five years — to frame the 
conversation for the next  
20 years.  
Cummins helped found  
HEI through former Cummins 
CEO Henry Schacht nearly 40 years ago. Government 
regulators, along with many 
companies in the motor vehicle 
industry, including Cummins 
customers and other members 
of the Truck and Engine 
Manufacturers Association,  
are also supporters of HEI.

PROVIDING  
THE SKILLS 
FOR SUCCESS
Cummins TEC: Technical Education for  
Communities is the first strategic community  
program built by the company from the ground  
up. Launched in 2012, its mission is to train  
disadvantaged youth in employable technical skills and connect  
them to good jobs in their communities through school-based,  
industry-supported skills training. 
The idea for TEC was born of 
business need: employers around 
the world are having trouble finding 
workers to fill good-paying roles as 
service and shop floor technicians. 
Hiring pools in many communities 
are suffering from insufficient 
fundamental technical skills.
There are also significant gaps 
in soft skills, such as problem-
solving, analytical ability and the 
proper attitudes and belief systems 
necessary for job success.  
Vocational education is an important 
way to elevate standards of living. Cummins developed curriculum, 
teacher training, guidance 
counseling manuals, achievement 
tests, equipment and tool lists, as 
well as methods for engaging local 
industry in curriculum and workplace 
learning opportunities for students.
There are currently 22 Cummins 
TEC programs around the world.  
Thirteen sites graduated a total of 
292 students in 2018, bringing the 
overall number of graduates in the

31 NEXT PREVHEALTH AND SAFETY:  
CREATING THE  
RIGHT CULTURE
The health and safety of Cummins employees  
is fundamental to the company’s sustainability, 
and 2018 saw several improvements in  
important metrics, including: 
 »A 17% IMPROVEMENT in the 
Contractor Incidence Rate, the 
number of recordable injuries 
involving contractors, to 0.768.
 »A 9% IMPROVEMENT in the 
Major Injury Rate for Cummins’ 
employees, which deals with 
serious but non-fatal injuries,  
to 0.043.
 »A 7% IMPROVEMENT in the 
company’s Incidence Rate,  
the rate of recordable injuries,  
to 0.646.
The improvements happened  
despite a 12% increase in hours 
worked at Cummins. THE JOURNEY
For much of the past decade, 
Cummins has been on a journey to 
become world class in health and 
safety. The company’s Global Health 
and Safety team has continued 
to strengthen a culture ensuring 
employees are fully engaged and 
committed to making Cummins a 
healthier and safer place to work.
Since 2010, the company’s Incidence 
and Severity Case Rates have been 
significantly below comparable 
industries (see chart on page 33). 
Overall the company has seen a  
50% reduction in injuries between 
2008 and 2018.The Global Health and Safety team 
offers risk-based hazard prevention 
and control tools in numerous 
areas, ranging from driver safety, 
hand safety, and lockout/tag-out 
procedures, to machine guarding  
and working safely at heights. 
The team also oversees an extensive 
safety training program. In 2018, 
Cummins employees completed 
nearly 1.8 million hours of safety 
training, an 8% increase over 2017. 
More than 12,000 employees have 
now completed “Live It. Lead It.”  
leadership training focusing on the 
kind of health and safety culture the 
company believes is critical to reduce 
and prevent injuries.
By taking direct action through 
training and by establishing the right  
culture, Cummins believes it can best  
protect its most important asset –  
its employees.There were no employee fatalities 
in 2018, but a 5% increase in the 
Severity Case Rate, the rate of 
injuries and illnesses resulting in 
lost work days per 100 employees, 
to 0.264. It was the only Cummins 
lagging indicator to increase.
LOOKING AHEAD
In addition to paying special  
attention to the company’s  
Severity Case Rate, Global Health 
and Safety will also have a special 
focus on contractor safety in  
2019. While Cummins saw a  
17% improvement for the  
Contractor Incidence Rate,  
major injuries suffered by  
contractors did not go down. 
Plans include webinars for  
Cummins employees on the 
importance of health and safety  
for contractors and strengthening 
the pre-qualification process for 
contractors to ensure a consistent 
process that always includes an 
emphasis on safety. 
 GOALS  
FOR 2023
Cummins believes 
progress can be driven 
by setting aggressive, 
but achievable goals. 
Here are key 2023 goals 
for health and safety:
 »Improve 
Cummins’ 
average Injury/ 
Illness Rate 
(Incidence Rate)  
by 38%
 »Improve the 
company’s  
Major Injury  
Rate by 30%
 »Improve 
Cummins’  
Lost Day Case  
Rate by 39%
 »Improve the 
company’s Lost  
Day Rate by 30%

INCLUSION PLAYS 
KEY ROLE IN 
SUSTAINABILITY 
At Cummins, valuing and including differences 
in decision making is the company’s competitive 
advantage. Having diverse employees doesn’t 
drive business success alone; it’s how the 
company uses diversity that makes an impact. Inclusion means truly making an 
effort to include, appreciate and 
value the unique backgrounds and 
skills that each employee brings to 
work, which is Cummins at its core. 
That’s when the company is at its 
best and can win for its customers, 
powering a more prosperous world. 
TRAINING  
IS KEY 
Cummins leaders understand  
the importance of diversity and 
inclusion to a global company.  
In 2018, more than 400 U.S. 
managers received training on 
unconscious bias and even more 
employees across the globe took 
part in the company’s “Inclusion 
Initiative - A Facilitated Discussion.” 
The company continues to 
improve its Spectrum of Diversity 
and Inclusion training, which is 
provided to all new employees 
during onboarding. The company’s 
refreshed Spectrum course 
sets Cummins’ expectations, 
teaches employees about their 
role in creating an inclusive work 
environment and provides new 
activities for employees to learn  and apply concepts related  
to diversity and inclusion.  
Spectrum closes with creation  
of a personal action plan. 
CONFERENCES 
ENCOURAGE 
DISCUSSION 
Cummins hosted a global Women’s 
Conference and its first U.S. 
Diversity Conference in 2018.  
The Women’s Conference brought 
together nearly 200 female and  
male leaders from all over the world. 
The theme for the week, “Powering 
Our Inclusion,” allowed for open and 
honest discussion on successes and 
challenges in creating full inclusion 
for women at Cummins. 
At the end of the conference, 
attendees were challenged to inspire 
commitment in others and use their 
influence to drive gender diversity 
and inclusion across the company 
and in its communities.
Cummins’ U.S. Diversity Conference 
focused on the company’s U.S.- 
based Black, Hispanic and Latino 
talent. More than 200 employees 
met in Indianapolis, Indiana (U.S.),  to network, exchange ideas  
and celebrate the successes  
of Cummins’ Black, Hispanic  
and Latino talent. 
Leaders, including Chairman and 
CEO Tom Linebarger and Alexis 
Herman, Lead Director of the 
Cummins Board of Directors, and 
the former Secretary of the U.S. 
Department of Labor, spoke at  
the conference. They talked about 
what is happening in the inclusion 
environment today, what it means  
to be authentic in your career 
journey and lessons learned from 
being a diverse leader. Through 
honest conversations, Cummins 
leaders openly shared challenges 
they face and talked about ways  
to overcome barriers. 
Diversity and inclusion is a key  
driver of Cummins’ success.  
Without different perspectives,  
the company would lose its  
ability to innovate and challenge  
the impossible.
Cummins believes diverse teams 
leveraging the power of their 
differences can arrive at more 
creative solutions for the company’s 
customers. These employees work 
at the company’s Commons office 
building in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.).  DISABILITY 
INCLUSION 
The company in 2018 
launched a focus on 
disability inclusion with 
the goal of increasing 
the employment of 
people with disabilities. 
Cummins’ vision is to 
become an employer 
of choice for people 
with disabilities and to 
work in communities 
to reduce barriers to 
employment for people 
with disabilities.

34 NEXT PREVEMPLOYEE RESOURCE GROUPS 
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) at Cummins are open  
to all employees and organized by different facets of diversity 
such as gender, generation, sexual orientation, racial and  
ethnic heritage, and disabilities. 
The groups are voluntary, employee-led groups that serve as a resource for 
members and the company by helping to foster a diverse, inclusive workplace 
aligned with Cummins’ mission, vision and values.  
With more than 150 ERGs worldwide, the groups provide ample opportunities 
for leadership training, cross-cultural learning and professional development. 
In 2018, the company started an initiative to more closely knit together global 
ERGs to amplify the voices they represent and harness their collective power  
to effect positive change.  GLOBAL

Cummins believes supplier diversity is critical to the  
company’s sustainability efforts. Using diverse suppliers* 
enables Cummins to tap into the power of diverse thoughts 
and approaches, increases competition for Cummins’  
business, and spreads the benefit of economic growth  
to a wider number of communities. 
In 2018, Cummins, for the first time, exceeded $2 billion in global  
spending with suppliers who self-identify as diverse in their region  
of the world. Two years earlier, Cummins was inducted into the  
Billion Dollar Roundtable, a prestigious advocate for best practices  
in corporate supplier diversity. Members must have exceeded  
$1 billion in annual spending with diverse suppliers in the U.S.

Cummins provides 
competitive compensation 
packages to attract, motivate 
and retain employees.  
It is critical the company 
provide competitive and 
equitable compensation  
and benefits programs to  
all Cummins employees.  
Market-based compensation 
data is collected and analyzed 
within each country in which 
the company operates, 
ensuring the company’s  
rates remain competitive.    
Cummins recognizes that 
market-based pay rates, at 
times, do not deliver wages 
necessary for a sustainable 
life-style. To that end, the 
company also collects “Living 
Wage” data in each country 
to ensure Cummins’ wages 
provide a sustainable living 
condition for its employees.   
Living Wage data is sourced 
from BSR™ (Business for 
Social Responsibility), an 
independent organization 
committed to building a  
just and sustainable world. PARENTAL LEAVE 
As a result of a strong 
financial performance in 
2017, Cummins accelerated 
the introduction of a new U.S. 
parental leave policy in 2018.  
In general, the policy provides 
eligible employees up to  
12 weeks of fully paid leave 
to primary caregivers and 
up to six weeks of fully paid 
leave to secondary caregivers 
following the birth, adoption 
or placement of a foster 
child/children. 
This is in addition to Disability 
Leave, which is intended to 
provide a medical recovery 
period for women following 
the birth of a child. Cummins 
recognizes that bringing

and challenging. Cummins

39 NEXT PREVRECORD YEAR 
ALLOWS CUMMINS 
TO INVEST IN ITS 
NEXT CENTURY 
Cummins had a record financial year in 2018, 
with $23.8 billion in revenues and net income 
attributable to the company of $2.1 billion. 
Revenues were up 16% compared 
to 2017, with the engine segment 
leading the way, accounting for 
about 35% of Cummins’ total 
revenues. The U.S. and Canada 
accounted for about 60% of the 
revenue by marketing territory in 
2018 followed by Europe and  
China, which collectively made  
up about 22%. 
Cummins Chairman and CEO  
Tom Linebarger pointed to the 
company’s 100th anniversary in 
2019 as he thanked employees  
who “made our 2018 record  
sales and profits a reality.”  “… Our financial 
strength allows us to 
continue investing and 
innovating across our 
broad portfolio of power 
solutions to remain a 
global technology leader 
for the next 100 years 
while continuing to 
return significant capital 
to investors,” he said. 
The company invested a record 
$902 million in research and 
development in 2018 and 
returned $1.9 billion or 78% 
of Operating Cash Flow to 
shareholders in the form of  
dividends and share repurchases. The $2.1 billion in net income 
attributable to Cummins for the full 
year ($13.15 per diluted share), 
compared to a net income of  
$999 million ($5.97 per diluted 
share), or $1.8 billion ($10.62 per 
diluted share) in 2017 excluding the 
impact of tax legislation. The tax rate 
for the full year in 2018 was 20.6%, 
or 21.1% excluding the favorable 
impact of discrete tax items. 
Increased truck production in  
North America and stronger  
demand in global construction and 
power generation markets helped 
drive the revenue increase while 
the stronger U.S. dollar negatively 
impacted revenues. 
 Highlights in 2018 included: 
 »The creation of Cummins’ 
Electrified Power Business 
Segment overseeing the 
company’s new electrified  
power platforms. 
 »The completion of the acquisition 
of the Silicon Valley-based Efficient 
Drivetrains, Inc. (EDI), which 
designs and produces hybrid and 
fully- electric power solutions for 
commercial vehicle markets. 
 »The company’s acquisition 
of the U.K.-based Johnson 
Matthey Battery Systems, which 
specializes in high-voltage, 
automotive grade battery systems 
for electric and hybrid vehicles.  In 2018, the company expanded a 
field campaign in the U.S. to repair

41 NEXT PREVINNOVATING TO BUILD A 
MORE PROSPEROUS WORLDCummins’ commitment to “powering a more 
prosperous world,” means helping customers 
succeed through innovation and dependability,  
so what’s good for them is also good for the 
environment and sustainability in general.   
Cummins, with its broad portfolio 
of power solutions and global 
footprint, is uniquely positioned 
to deliver innovation that reduces 
environmental impact, including  
for climate change, while  
improving performance and 
reliability. The company spent a 
record $902 million on research  
and development in 2018. 
New sources of energy are 
becoming increasingly important in 
the commercial vehicle and power 
generation industries. Cummins 
is committed to ensuring the 
power of choice is available to all 
its customers. Advancements in 
connectivity and automation will 
drive efficiencies even further.  
Each of Cummins business 
segments had many innovative 
accomplishments in 2018, but  
its newest segment, Electrified 
Power, perhaps garnered the most 
attention. The acquisition of Silicon 
Valley-based Efficient Drivetrains, 
Inc., which designs and produces hybrid and fully- electric power 
solutions for commercial vehicle 
markets, and Johnson Matthey 
Battery Systems, significantly  
added to Cummins’ electrified  
power portfolio.  
While Cummins has a vigorous 
electrification program underway, 
innovation also continues in  
diesel and natural gas engines. 
Continuing to improve fuel  
economy, performance and 
durability in these areas is critical  
as many applications will rely on 
them for the foreseeable future.  
Remarkable strides have been  
made in these technologies.  
For example, from the first diesel 
engine built at the Jamestown 
Engine Plant in Jamestown,  
New York (U.S.), in 1981 to the 
2 millionth engine that rolled off 
Jamestown’s line in the summer  
of 2018, the company’s engineers  
have reduced oxides of nitrogen 
(NOx) and particulate emissions  
(PM) by 98%.  
Vice President and Chief Technical 
Officer Jennifer Rumsey leads a tour 
at the opening of the new Cummins 
Machine Integration Center in 
Columbus, Indiana (U.S.) in 2018. 
The state-of-the-art center tests the 
integration of Cummins’ products  
and concepts into customer trucks 
and other equipment.

It also means working with an 
eye on the future. The company’s 
manufacturing function is laying the 
groundwork today to integrate  future technologies that will help 
ensure the company’s sustainability 
for years to come.  
Cummins is celebrating its  
100th anniversary in 2019.  
Through the company’s commitment 
to product quality, environmental

47 NEXT PREVSTRIVING FOR 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
EXCELLENCE 
Manufacturing plays a key role in helping the 
company meet its environmental goals, working  
to reduce the waste it produces and the  
water and energy it uses – and by extension,  
the greenhouse gas it produces. 
Through programs like the 
Environmental Champions, more 
than 1,000 Cummins employees 
have been trained to find ways to 
reduce the company’s environmental 
impact by fixing leaks, replacing 
inefficient equipment and changing 
practices around water, waste and 
energy in plants and facilities. 
The manufacturing function has 
also made significant investments in 
everything from LED lighting to the 
latest regenerative dynamometers, 
capable of capturing the energy 
generated by engine testing to  
help power company plants. 
Cummins suppliers are asked to 
do their part. They are required to 
sign a form agreeing to comply with the company’s Supplier Code of 
Conduct. “We expect Cummins 
suppliers and their subcontractors 
to comply with all applicable 
environmental laws, regulations  
and standards,” the supplier  
code states. “It is important that 
suppliers manage compliance, 
minimize environmental impact  
and drive continual improvement  
of environmental compliance.” 
The company also has established 
Green Supply Chain Principles, 
which say Cummins and its 
suppliers should work to “reduce  
the environmental impact over 
the full life cycle of all products, 
processes, and materials by 
measuring, setting reduction  
goals and monitoring progress.”ENVIRONMENTAL 
MILESTONES
By reducing the waste it produces 
and the water and energy it uses, 
manufacturing at Cummins has played 
a key role in the company’s progress 
toward several of the company’s 
environmental goals, including:
 »A 29% reduction in  
energy intensity (energy 
adjusted by hours worked) 
across the company toward a 
2020 goal of a 32% reduction 
using 2010 as a baseline.
 »A 50.3% reduction in 
direct water use intensity 
(adjusted by hours worked), 
surpassing the company’s 
2020 goal of 50% using  
2010 as a baseline.
 »The company is nearing 
the half-way point for 
converting lighting in its 
plants to LEDs and has 
completed dozens of  
projects to increase 
Cummins’ use of returnable 
and recyclable packaging.
Employees at the Seymour Engine 
Plant stand in front of one of the

48 NEXT PREVSOCIALLY COMMITTED, 
FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE 
Cummins is committed to the health, safety and social wellbeing of its 
employees, as well as the employees of the suppliers who work in its  
supply chain. The company is also looking closely at the future of 
manufacturing and how technology could change it. Here’s a look: 
EYES OPEN AUDITS 
The Supplier Code of Conduct  
states its support for human rights 
and its opposition to any kind of 
compulsory labor as well as any  
form of human trafficking. 
“We insist that our suppliers also 
uphold these principles and we 
are committed to working with all 
suppliers and other partners as they  
undertake similar assessments of  
their own business,” the code states.  
In 2018, Cummins revised its Supplier 
Code of Conduct and required its 
more than 4,000 suppliers to accept 
the new code – 100% have accepted 
the company’s supplier code.  
In addition to the screening that  
takes place before a supplier joins Cummins’ supply chain, the  
company can perform what it calls 
Eyes Open Audits on any supplier.  
In 2018, Cummins personnel,  
mostly from the company’s  
purchasing function, performed  
423 Eyes Open Audits looking 
specifically for problems in worker 
health, worker safety, protecting 
Cummins information, hazardous  
or unsafe materials and child labor 
and treatment of others issues.  
Health and safety issues are typically 
addressed immediately. Other issues  
can be referred to a special committee 
that works to help suppliers improve. 
The company reserves the right to  
do more extensive audits with any  
supplier as a condition of doing 
business with Cummins. INDUSTRY 4.0 
The company’s manufacturing 
function is preparing for future 
technology changes that could  
have a seismic change on the  
way it works. 
Cummins has its own take 
on Industry 4.0, the trend of 
automation, cloud computing and 
data-driven technology that some 
call the fourth Industrial Revolution.   
At Cummins, Industry 4.0 includes 
everything from collaborative robots 
to artificial intelligence, augmented 
reality and the enhanced integration 
between information technologies 
and manufacturing operations. The company, for example, worked 
extensively with 3D metal printing  
in 2018 and sold Cummins’ first  
metal 3D part it had printed itself 
in the first quarter of 2019. The 
company also acquired a 3D metal 
binder jet printer in the first quarter 
of 2019, which will be capable of  
3D printing at much higher speeds 
than previous 3D technology.
ABOVE  Cummins is exploring the 
potential of 3D printing as it looks  
to the future of manufacturing  
and its supply chain.

COMPLIANCE 
PLAYS KEY ROLE 
IN CUMMINS’ 
SUSTAINABILITYSustainability at Cummins is built on a foundation 
of ethical behavior from the shop floor to the 
company’s Board of Directors. The Ethics and 
Compliance function plays a critical role in 
Cummins maintaining its long-standing reputation 
as an ethical company around the world. 
All Cummins employees worldwide 
are required to comply with the 
company’s Code of Business 
Conduct, built around 10 principles 
Cummins reinforces through more 
than a dozen online training courses 
(see chart on page 54). These courses cover a number 
of areas, including anti-bribery, 
conflicts of interest, data privacy, 
export controls, fair labor standards, 
fair competition and more. The 
company also conducts an annual 
Ethics Certification process to 
ensure employees across Cummins, Cummins Ethics and Compliance  
plays a key role in promoting the  
Code of Business Conduct among the  
company’s more than 60,000 employees.MAINTAINING 
A RESPECTFUL 
WORKPLACE
In response to the global 
attention focused on  
sexual harassment  
and other inappropriate  
conduct, Cummins in  
2018 initiated training 
designed to reinforce  
its policies and ensure  
a respectful workplace.
The Ethics and Compliance 
function, working closely 
with Human Resources 
and the legal function 
at Cummins, rolled out 
online training on sexual 
harassment to 32,000 office 
and exempt employees. 
In addition, the company 
provided in-depth, face-to-
face training to top leaders 
at Cummins in 2018.
In 2019, the company 
is providing face-to-
face training on sexual 
harassment to all shop  
and other hourly  
workers worldwide.

52 NEXT PREVCODE OF  
CONDUCT 
PRINCIPLES
Here are the major principles behind 
Cummins’ Code of Business Conduct:
 01 We will follow the  
law everywhere.
 02 We will embrace  
diverse perspectives  
and backgrounds, and  
treat people with dignity  
and respect.
 03 We will compete fairly  
and honestly.
 04 We will avoid conflicts  
of interest.
 05 We will demand that  
everything we do leads  
to a cleaner, healthier  
and safer environment.
 06 We will protect our technology, 
our information and our intellectual 
property.
 07 We will demand that our financial 
records are accurate and that our 
reporting processes are clear  
and understandable.
 08 We will strive to improve  
our communities.
 09 We will communicate  
honestly and with integrity.
 10 We will create a culture where 
employees take responsibility 
for ethical behavior.no matter where they are based, 
understand the company’s Code of 
Conduct and its underlying policies. 
As part of the 2018 campaign, 
33,499 employees completed 
Cummins’ Ethics Certification, 
including all members of the 
company’s Board of Directors.  
The Ethics and Compliance team 
reviewed any exceptions and 
worked with Cummins’ Human 
Resources function to ensure they 
were documented and investigated. 
The company works hard to 
communicate to its employees the 
importance of ethics at Cummins. 
It has a website where employees 
can report any potential violations 
of the company’s ethics policies. 
The website also includes telephone 
hotlines for reporting around the 
world. Reports can be made 
anonymously where allowed by law. 
A global team of Master 
Investigators examines any concerns 
the company receives (see chart 
on page 54). Cummins also has a 
strict non-retaliation policy protecting 
employees who make reports.HUMAN  
RIGHTS 
A major new initiative in 2018 
was the development of training 
connected to the company’s Human 
Rights Policy. The policy, adopted 
in 2017, bans numerous forms of 
compulsory labor in addition to  
child labor and human trafficking. 
The ban covers both the company 
and its suppliers. 
Many of these provisions were 
included in the Code of Business 
Conduct and the company’s 
Supplier Code of Conduct, but 
leaders wanted to make it absolutely 
clear where Cummins stands on 
these important issues. 
In addition to making the human 
rights training available for company 
employees in 2019, the Ethics & 
Compliance team is working to 
incorporate it into the Eyes Open 
audits that Cummins employees 
perform when they visit suppliers 
to review contract performance  
(see page 49). EMPLOYEE  
SURVEY 
The Ethics & Compliance team 
worked with the Ethisphere  
Institute in 2018 to survey  
Cummins employees about their 
perceptions regarding the ethical 
culture at Cummins. More than 
16,000 employees from around  
the world participated in the survey.  
While the survey found broad 
recognition of the importance 
Cummins places on ethical behavior, 
the survey also showed that 
employees’ willingness to speak up 
to report concerns and employees’ 
knowledge of company policies 
varied based on their geographic 
location and their role with Cummins. 
Ethics and Compliance is preparing 
detailed action plans to target  
areas of improvement identified  
in the survey.CUMMINS 
SUPPLIER CODE  
OF CONDUCT
The Supplier Code of Conduct 
helps the company ensure it  
is doing business with other 
companies around the world  
sharing Cummins’ values  
for sustainable practices. 
It is built around seven principles:
 01 Obey the law everywhere.
 02 Treat people with  
dignity and respect.
 03 Avoid conflicts of interest.
 04 Provide a safe and  
healthy workspace.
 05 Protect Cummins  
technology, information  
and intellectual property.
 06 Protect the environment and  
conserve natural resources.
 07 Assist Cummins in  
enforcing the code.
Cummins requires a verification 
response from suppliers that they 
are following the code before they 
are added to the company’s supplier 
database. Cummins may visit 
facilities, review documentation and 
conduct an audit if necessary to 
ensure compliance. See more in the 
Supply Chain section on page 49.

THE CODE
Training and guidance are not enough to ensure compliance.  
Cummins relies on its employees to speak up if they witness behavior 
that potentially violates the Business Code of Conduct. Once a 
potential issue is reported, Cummins has a global team of Master 
Investigators who investigate alleged Code of Conduct violations. 
In 2018, 2,215 cases were investigated, 35% of those cases were 
substantiated and 40% of the substantiated cases led to terminations.

AND INDEPENDENT 
JUDGMENT
The Board of Directors provides independent  
and sound judgment on significant issues 
at Cummins, protecting the interests of the 
company’s shareholders. 
Made up of 10 independent directors (consistent with the definition 
established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and  
the New York Stock Exchange) and two Cummins leaders, the board  
believes the company’s interests are best served by combining the roles  
of Chairman and CEO and appointing an independent Lead Director.  
The board reviews this decision annually. 
Alexis M. Herman, the Lead Director 
of the company’s Board of Directors, 
participates in Cummins’ U.S.  
Diversity Growth Initiative conference 
in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.).
The Lead Director has many critical 
duties (see chart on page 56),  
including conferring with the 
chairman on, and approving board 
agendas as well as serving as the 
chairman of the Governance and 
Nominating Committee. Cummins 
is fortunate to have former U.S. 
Secretary of Labor Alexis M. 
Herman in this important position.  
Cummins’ board has six  
standing committees: 
 »Governance and Nominating 
 »Audit 
 »Compensation 
 »Executive 
 »Finance 
 »Safety, Environment

56 NEXT PREVMANAGING RISK IS 
KEY TO CUMMINS’ 
SUSTAINABILITY
Managing risk effectively is another critical factor  
in Cummins’ sustainability. To get that job done, 
the company’s Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) team works with the company’s top 
leaders, regional leaders in Cummins’ Area 
Business Organizations (ABOs) and Cummins’ 
Internal Audit function. The company’s approach to risk 
starts with its Enterprise Risk 
Council, made up of the company’s 
top leaders, who, working with 
ERM, oversee risk management 
and provide direction on risk-related 
matters. The council, established 
in 2016, is part of a framework 
designed to drive continuous 
improvement in risk management, 
where risk is recognized and 
responded to appropriately.  
A company leader takes ownership 
of each individual risk that could 
impact the company’s growth plans 
or long-term sustainability. ERM also 
works with the leaders of Cummins’ 
regional organizations, known as 
Area Business Organizations or 
ABOs, to take greater oversight 
of risk management at individual 
locations within the company. 
Every Cummins location, more 
than 600 in all, has a Business 
Continuity Plan. The plan directs 
how each site would operate amid 
a major disruption such as a natural 
disaster affecting the location or a 
major supplier. Sites are required to 
conduct tabletop exercises on  
a regular basis to test how each 
would react in an emergency. ABO leaders are responsible for 
ensuring these exercises are both 
robust and accomplished within their 
regions. In addition, more extensive 
“stress tests” are conducted at least 
once every four years by a third 
party working with ERM and other 
functions at Cummins at the more 
than 70 sites deemed most critical 
to Cummins’ operations.  
ERM also keeps a running list of top 
risks facing the company. It works 
with the Internal Audit function 
and the risk owners to prepare 
special reports on those presenting 
the greatest risk to Cummins and 
reports regularly on them to the 
company’s Board of Directors. 
Cummins believes this multi-faceted 
approach is critical to effectively 
managing risk. 
TO LEARN MORE 
To find more on specific risks facing 
the company, go to page 17 of 
Cummins’ 2018 Annual Report  
on Form 10K.
Every Cummins site has a Business 
Continuity Plan directing how it would

RELATIONS: 
PARTNERING 
TO BUILD A 
BETTER WORLD
Cummins’ global Government Relations team 
works in a variety of ways to support the 
company’s sustainability initiatives and its mission 
to make people’s lives better by powering a more 
prosperous world. 
In 2018, the company promoted the 
adoption of tough and enforceable 
environmental regulations, 
announced additional investments 
in clean technologies including 
electrification and worked to  
protect global supply chains.  
The Government Relations 
team joined company leaders in 
championing a policy framework 
that supports giving customers the 
power of choice when it comes  
to selecting the right technology  
to power today while building 
towards a sustainable future. In the United States, Cummins 
supported making real world 
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) reductions 
a priority for regulators at both 
the state and federal levels. With 
its industry partners, Cummins 
endorsed the roll out of the EPA’s 
new Cleaner Truck Initiative, which 
will include future rulemaking to 
establish updated NOx standards 
for on-highway commercial 
vehicle engines. Globally, the 
company supported adoption and 
implementation of tougher emissions  
 and fuel efficiency standards in 
China, India and Brazil.   
In Europe, the Government Relations 
team is actively working to build 
relationships across the continent 
so Cummins is viewed as a trusted 
technology partner. The team 
also worked with Cummins’ new 
Electrified Power segment, which 
became a member of the European 
Battery Alliance and contributed 
to the creation of a competitive 
manufacturing value chain in 
Europe. Furthermore, the team is 
working with governments on new 
emissions standards for heavy duty 
vehicles, fuel efficiency and other 
environmental regulations.  
 CYBER SECURITY 
AND FREE -TRADE 
Cummins has also become an 
industry leader in promoting 
cybersecure commercial vehicles.  
The company serves in a leadership 
capacity for several trade groups and 
provided technical expertise to the 
U.S. Congress, the Department of 
Transportation and the Department 
of Homeland Security. Cummins 
has also been advocating for a 
nationwide data privacy law in the 
U.S. that ensures data is appropriately 
consumed and protected.   
Free trade agreements are vital  
to Cummins’ diverse global  
supplier network. The company’s  
global supplier network enables Cummins to deliver for its  
customers while meeting rigorous 
emissions standards around the 
world. Cummins consistently  
works to maintain and promote 
trade agreements with partner 
nations. That allows the company  
to leverage the best suppliers  
in the world, maintaining  
Cummins’ competitiveness. 
As the company invests in sustainable 
technology throughout its global 
supply chain, the future for Cummins 
is bright. The Government Relations 
team will continue to partner with 
the company’s business segments 
to ensure policymakers know and 
understand the company’s work  
and how we can all work together  
to power a more prosperous world.

Cummins belongs to a number of trade 
organizations to further its business interests. 
While the company might not agree with these 
associations on every matter, Cummins believes 
they help ensure government leaders know  
where the company stands on key issues.  
Here’s a list of U.S. trade organizations Cummins paid dues in excess 
of $50,000 during calendar year 2018, as well as the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, which fell below the $50,000 threshold. Listed with each entity  
is Cummins’ estimation of the portion of these dues used for lobbying or  
other political expenditures:POLITICAL  
CONTRIBUTIONS 
In the U.S., political contributions are made by the Cummins Inc. Political 
Action Committee (CIPAC), and funded solely by voluntary employee 
contributions. CIPAC makes contributions to federal and state candidates  
on a bipartisan basis and according to federal and state election laws.  
CIPAC is governed by corporate 
policies and bylaws that state: 
 »CIPAC contributions are  
strictly voluntary.  
 »Employees will not be  
reimbursed directly or indirectly  
for political contributions. 
 »Employees will not be  
pressured to contribute to  
CIPAC or make any other  
personal political contribution. 
 »Failure to contribute to CIPAC 
shall not disadvantage an 
employee’s career.CIPAC contributions are based on: 
 »Public integrity of the candidate. 
 »Representation of a Cummins 
facility or employees. 
 »Support for issues  
important to Cummins. 
 »Timely and effective  
constituent service.
 »Political leadership or organization. 
 »Support for the company’s values. 
All of CIPAC’s activities are disclosed 
to the Cummins Board of Directors 
in an annual political contribution 
report. A complete list of the political 
action committee’s contributions to 
candidates is available here. 
  POLITICAL 
ACTIVITIES
Cummins bans contributions 
using corporate funds to 
candidates, political parties and 
independent expenditures, including 
advertisements that support or 
oppose individual candidates. 
The company also will not use 
corporate funds to contribute to  
501 (c) (4) and 527 tax-exempt 
groups in the United States that  
are engaged in political activity or 
make payments to influence ballot 
issues unless the issues are directly 
tied to the company’s core values 
and business interests. 
In those cases, Cummins is 
committed to publicly disclosing any 
payments including recipient names 
and amounts. The company made 
no such payments in 2018. TRADE
