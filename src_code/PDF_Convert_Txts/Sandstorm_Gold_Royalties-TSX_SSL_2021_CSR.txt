2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTOver the years, our team has worked to build a 
company with the highest standards in terms 
of integrity, diversity, and making a positive 
global impact. We believe that these values are 
not mutually exclusive to creating shareholder 
value and our track record is indicative of that.
Sandstorm provides financing solutions 
to mining companies through royalty and 
streaming transactions. These royalty inter -
ests are held on properties developed and 
operated by independent mining companies, 
and as such Sandstorm is uniquely positioned 
to influence Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) issues. While Sandstorm 
has no control over the day-to-day operations, 
we recognize the potential that mining com-
panies have to make a meaningful positive 
impact in their communities. We’ve devel -
oped a comprehensive due diligence process Founded over a decade ago, Sandstorm was 
established with the vision to do things 
differently in an industry that has both a 
rewarding and complex history.
that integrates ESG-related issues into the 
evaluation of every investment opportunity. 
Our team reviews hundreds of projects each 
year and discards many opportunities for not 
meeting our stringent due diligence standards. 
Over the last several years, Sandstorm has 
rejected over half a billion dollars in potential 
transaction deals because of various environ -
mental and social concerns.
Beyond the due diligence process, Sandstorm 
is committed to corporate governance best 
practices, which includes building a diverse 
workforce and empowering our mining part -
ners and employees to engage in initiatives 
that support their communities. As a result, 
Sandstorm is ranked as an industry leader by 
some of the most respected regulating bodies 
including an “AA” rating from MSCI, and top 
rankings by Sustainalytics in the Precious Metals Industry and Gold Subindustry. 
Sandstorm is also a member of the World Gold 
Council and the UN Global Compact, and has 
committed to voluntarily aligning its opera -
tions and corporate strategy with the spirit of 
the 10 universally accepted principles in the 
areas of human rights, labour, environment, 
and anti-corruption, and to take actions that 
support broader UN goals.
This report is designed to provide our share-
holders and interested parties with a clear 
understanding of Sandstorm’s corporate 
responsibility practices. Our goal is that 
readers will be educated in our approach to 
investment due diligence, mining partner -
ships, employee engagement, and will see 
why Sandstorm is considered a leader in this 
industry.

INTRODUCTION COMMITMENTS APPROACH
2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTSandstorm is a gold royalty company with a diverse portfolio 
of royalty assets. Since 2008, we’ve been a leader in reshaping 
the mine investment landscape with our innovative busi -
ness model. With hundreds of streams and royalties in our 
portfolio, our team has put in thousands of hours reviewing 
investment opportunities with strict criteria in order to curate 
one of the best royalty portfolios in the world. As of this pub -
lication date, we have 29 assets in production with more in 
development, providing both stable cashflows and an exciting 
growth trajectory.Our Business Model
Sandstorm Gold Royalties provides an alternative source of capital to 
the mining industry in the form of stream and royalty financing arrange -
ments. In exchange for upfront capital, Sandstorm receives a portion of 
the future metal or revenue generated from a mining operation. Being 
a financier, Sandstorm does not directly own or operate the projects 
and thus has indirect exposure to ESG issues that can arise during the 
life-cycle of a resource project. Sandstorm’s indirect exposure to ESG 
risk factors is mitigated in part by our diversified portfolio.
There is no evidence of a statistical relationship or positive correlation 
between the ESG successes and challenges at the various mining projects 
within Sandstorm’s royalty portfolio, indicating a clear diversification 
benefit to this portfolio approach.
Sandstorm is committed to furthering sustainable development in 
the mining and metals industry through its investments and seeks to 
address ESG risks through the company’s due diligence process that 
guides its investment decisions.Who We Are

INTRODUCTION COMMITMENTS APPROACH
2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTHow a Gold Royalty Works
Similar to a music royalty, a gold royalty is simply a contract that 
gives the owner (i.e. a gold royalty company) rights to a portion 
of the final product. This can be a percentage of revenue or actual 
gold production (called a “stream”). Gold royalty companies pay an 
upfront sum for royalty rights and use these contracts to finance 
mining companies in need of capital. Since royalties typically cover 
the life of a mine, gold royalty companies benefit from the explo-
ration upside that may extend the life of the mine and increase 
the amount of revenue (or gold) they receive from the mine at no 
additional cost.
DISCOVERY
When gold is discovered on a 
property, there are a number of 
stages that it must go through 
before it can become a cash-
flowing mine. The process is 
often time-intensive and requires 
a lot of upfront capital.EXPLORATION
Mining companies use various 
exploration techniques like rock 
sampling, geological mapping, 
and drilling on the property. 
Technical studies are completed 
to determine if the gold deposit 
could be a viable mine.DEVELOPMENT
If the exploration studies 
indicate the potential for an eco-
nomical mine, the project moves 
into development. Construction 
requires lots of capital, which 
can be partially funded through 
a royalty or stream financing.PRODUCTION
Once construction is complete, 
the project moves into produc-
tion to begin producing gold. If 
the mining company used a roy -
alty to fund development, they 
begin making payments to the 
royalty owner.PAYMENT
A royalty owner receives pay -
ment as a percentage of the 
revenue from the mine. A stream 
agreement holder receives a per-
centage of gold production at a 
pre-determined discount, then 
sells the gold at market price.

2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTI Investment Decisions
The properties over which Sandstorm holds 
stream and royalty interests are owned and 
operated by independent mining companies 
and Sandstorm does not exercise control or 
influence over the activities of the property 
owners. However, Sandstorm is committed 
to furthering the responsible development 
of mineral projects and the sustainable 
extraction of metals through its financial 
investments, including with respect to envi -
ronmental factors (e.g., social license to 
operate, toxic emissions and waste, biodi -
versity and land use and water stress), social 
considerations (e.g., occupational health and 
safety, labour management), and governance 
issues (e.g., corruption and instability, corpo -
rate governance).
We primarily seek to address ESG issues ini-
tially through the due diligence process when 
making new investments, which is described 
in more detail in this report. Our team has adopted internal policies that guide our 
investment process and our ongoing relation -
ships with both operators and shareholders. 
We are proud to have made meaningful social 
contributions at both the corporate and 
individual levels and we intend to consider 
additional partnerships with our mining part -
ners to support appropriate environmental 
and social initiatives in the communities asso -
ciated with our investments.
II Mining Partners
At the core of Sandstorm’s business are the 
partnerships with our mining operators. 
Each year our mining partners produce var -
ious reports and documentation regarding 
their own sustainability efforts. We have high -
lighted a selection of operators, which made 
up the majority (75%) of our attributable gold 
ounces for 2021. Sandstorm is proud of the Overview
accomplishments of these companies and the 
ongoing commitment to responsible produc -
tion that they demonstrate.
III Corporate Impact
Sandstorm operates solely within an 
office environment with a relatively small 
workforce. The company has 24 full-time 
employees split between the Vancouver head 
office and a smaller Toronto office. As such, 
the direct impact on the environment is very 
small. Nonetheless, Sandstorm continues to 
do its part to address climate change through 
reducing our environmental footprint and 
by managing the environmental and social 
impacts of our investing activities. The com-
pany also follows best practices in regard 
to employee management practices and 
maintaining the highest level of integrity in 
corporate governance.
INTRODUCTION COMMITMENTS APPROACH

2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT“Central to Sandstorm’s mandate of financing 
mining operations is the investment due 
diligence process. Each year, the technical 
team at Sandstorm reviews hundreds of 
opportunities in the relentless pursuit of 
finding projects that not only have attractive 
investment potential but also meet our high 
standards of ESG due diligence.” Investment Decisions I
Sandstorm drives shareholder value by realizing long-term investment opportunities 
in mining assets. Often our royalties outlive the operators of the asset, so we imagine 
not only how a mine functions under current management and conditions but how 
it will operate under future operators and markets. ESG factors play a central role 
in determining the success of a long-term mining investment. Sandstorm’s strategy 
to mitigate ESG risks involves a thorough investigation and evaluation of the risk 
factors related to a mineral property prior to an investment. While Sandstorm has 
no control over a project or the various ESG risks associated with a mine, we rec -
ognize that a good investment is a mine that will function safely, successfully, and 
with multi-generational support of local communities and governments.

 4Due Diligence Process
The aim of Sandstorm's due diligence process is to successfully identify 
projects and companies that will operate successfully and profitably while 
acting in a sustainable manner.
Sandstorm’s management team applies a multi-disciplinary approach when 
evaluating potential transactions. In addition to relying on management’s 
expertise, Sandstorm benefits from the experience and expertise of its Board 
of Directors. Board members are active in the review of potential material 
investments including participation in due diligence and providing technical, 
operational, political, financial, environmental, corporate social responsibility, 
and other expertise where applicable. The due diligence team consists of 
professionals with experience and expertise in the fields of geology, mining, 
metallurgy, engineering, government policy and finance. By conducting a 
robust and detailed due diligence process, Sandstorm endeavours to invest 
in projects with relatively low ESG risk. Where appropriate, the due dili -
gence process involves, among other things, thorough desktop studies, the 
engagement of expert consultants, extensive interviews with the project man -
agement team, site visits, as well as in-depth deliberation. The due diligence 
process may vary depending on the project's stage of development and the 
materiality of the investment to Sandstorm. Sandstorm will determine if an 
investment should be made based on overall criteria, including ESG factors. 
The overall criteria are reviewed regularly by management and/or the Board 
of Directors where applicable.

2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTThird Party Evaluation
Sandstorm routinely engages third-party experts to assist in its eval-
uation of new investments, which can include external legal counsel 
(including in the jurisdictions in which a project is located), technical 
consultants, and other consultants for purposes that can include ESG 
factors.
Ongoing Due Diligence
After making an investment, Sandstorm monitors the ESG performance 
of its counterparties on an ongoing basis. Sandstorm’s streaming and 
royalty agreements typically include the following types of provisions 
for ongoing due diligence and to reduce exposure to ESG risks:
AUDIT AND INSPECTION RIGHTS
 Ƚ Sandstorm may be entitled to audit the books and records of its partners on 
a periodic basis and may access and inspect the properties comprising the 
project. These rights provide Sandstorm further insight into the operations 
and assist in confirming compliance with the terms of the streaming and  
royalty agreements.
REPORTING OBLIGATIONS
 Ƚ Streaming and royalty agreements typically contain a series of reporting obli-
gations including the delivery of month and/or annual reports, updated mine 
plans, forecasts, and other documentation which serve to keep Sandstorm 
informed of operations.TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS
 Ƚ Sandstorm’s agreements may have restrictions that either (a) require consent 
for the operator of the agreement to transfer a mine project, or ( b) otherwise 
establish the circumstances in which such transfer is permissible. Such con-
straints are intended to ensure Sandstorm continues to be partnered with a 
quality operator over the life of the agreement.
SECURITY
 Ƚ Where appropriate, Sandstorm will look to have in place suitable security 
arrangements, including corporate guarantees and/or other security over 
the mine project. This security is designed to secure Sandstorm’s investment 
during the term of the streaming or royalty agreement, to help mitigate the 
risks of insolvency or bankruptcy of the operator.
In addition to the above, Sandstorm manages ESG risks arising from 
current streams and royalties by undertaking ongoing due diligence 
where applicable, which includes but is not limited to, site visits, ongoing 
dialogue with the operators, and review of the corporate and social 
responsibility reports that are published by the company’s partners. 
We closely monitor and rely on all public disclosures of our operators.
Sandstorm endorses the ICMM Principals, the IFC Environmental, 
Health and Safety Guidelines for Mining and the e3 Plus Framework 
for Responsible Exploration.

2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTAnti-Corruption
Sandstorm expects its employees, officers, directors and contractors to 
promote honest and ethical behavior, to avoid conflicts of interest, to 
comply with governmental laws and applicable rules and regulations, 
and to help foster the company’s culture of honesty and accountability. 
To this end, Sandstorm has outlined a comprehensive bribery and fraud 
prevention program which covers topic areas such as bribery, fraud, 
conflict of interest, administrative corruption, facilitation payments, 
breach of duty, misuse of authority and criminal activity. All employees, 
officers, directors and contractors are required to read and sign the 
policy in order to evidence that they understand and agree to conduct 
their work in accordance with the terms of the policy.
Bribery & Fraud Prevention Program  •
Whistleblower
The company’s whistleblower policy allows for the anonymous sub -
mission of any concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing 
matters or violations of the company’s Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics. Employees may submit concerns directly to the audit committee 
using either the whistleblower hotline (a confidential, anonymous 
and toll-free telephone line available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) or 
via mail or email. The audit committee reviews and investigates each 
complaint and takes appropriate corrective actions. To date, there have 
been no complaints received through the Whistleblower hotline.
Whistleblower Policy  •Information Security
Sandstorm’s information systems, and those of its counterparties under 
the precious metal purchase agreements and vendors, are vulnerable to 
an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. To help 
in mitigating this risk, the company has an ongoing Cyber Awareness 
program, which first began in 2019, as well as cyber security insurance. 
The Cyber Awareness program is run by experts in the field and provides 
an ongoing reassessment of cyber risk that the company is potentially 
exposed to. The program provides training and simulations to all of 
Sandstorm’s employees, educating employees of what they can do to 
reduce this risk. Training is required of all employees. The Company’s 
Cyber Awareness program also assesses new risks, and Sandstorm’s 
exposure to ongoing risks, including social engineering and phishing 
emails. The CFO is provided with a monthly update on the program, and 
the Disclosure Committee reviews any significant changes or updates 
as they occur. The Audit Committee is updated on an annual basis, 
or as needed, for all information security activity. Due in part to this 
program, Sandstorm has not experienced a material security breach in 
the history of the company.
Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee 
The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee is in place to

applicable, the Committee also engages with 
our stakeholders in respect of ESG issues.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Our Audit Committee oversee the Company’s 
risk management, which includes climate 
change risks. This includes a review of our key 
risks and exposures with a view to ensuring that 
such risks and exposures are being effectively 
managed, monitored or mitigated by reviewing 
management’s assessment of the significant 
risks and exposures impacting our company. 
The Board and Committees regularly meet 
with senior management to determine our 
strategy with respect to our risks and exposures. 
Management last provided an update to the Board 
on ESG-related risks and strategies, including 
climate-related strategies, in early 2022.
The Board, and relevant subcommittees, oversee 
senior management, who are responsible for 
the execution of ESG and climate-related 
opportunities and for the management of ESG 
and climate-related risks. Our Chief Executive 
Officer is responsible for the leadership on ESG 
and climate-related matters, and our VP , Financial 
Planning & Analysis has executive responsibility 
over such matters. ESG strategy, and managing cli-
mate-related risks, is considered where applicable, 
in each of the company’s departments, with specific 
consideration by our technical team when under -
going due diligence of new opportunities, as further 
discussed in our Sustainability Report on page 17.Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
Sandstorm is proud to be a leading company in 
sustainability and recognizes the importance of 
continuing actions to reduce climate change. In 
addition to reporting our progress on Greenhouse 
Gases (“GHG”) and climate change in our 
Sustainability Report, we also disclose through 
CDP , formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure 
Project. This year marks the first year that we 
have aligned our sustainability reporting with 
the recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”).
Governance
The organization’s governance around 
climate-related risks and opportunities  
Sandstorm’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), 
and relevant subcommittees, provide over -
sight on the company’s approach to climate 
change, and to our overall Environmental, 
Social and Governance (“ESG”) risks. This 
includes considerations of climate-related 
opportunities and risks affecting our business. 
The following Board Committees have 
oversight of ESG and climate-related 
opportunities, risks, and disclosures:

2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTSandstorm’s senior executives regularly attend 
Board meetings, and provide updates on royalty 
acquisition opportunities, which include, 
where applicable, ESG and climate-related 
considerations. Where materially adverse ESG 
or climate-related considerations arise during 
the due diligence process, management and/
or the Board may decide not to proceed with 
the royalty or stream opportunity. Over the 
past several years, Sandstorm has rejected 
potential transactions valued at over $500 
million, on the basis of ESG concerns.
Strategy
The actual and potential impacts of climate-related 
risks and opportunities on the organization’s 
business, strategy, and financial planning
As Sandstorm operates in an office environment, 
the Company’s direct environmental impact and 
carbon footprint is small. Due to the nature of 
our business, we are not directly exposed to the 
majority of climate-related risks that mining 
operators face. However, we recognize that 
climate-related risks are material for our mining 
stream partners, and in some situations, can 
pass through to us. Specifically, this can occur 
where climate-related incidents or developments 
adversely impact either the production at an 
operation, and therefore, the royalty payments 
received by our company; and/or the reputation 
of our partner, which can have impacts on 
our company for having invested in them. 
To manage our risks, we screen for significant 
risks through our due diligence process 
before making an investment with a partner. Our due diligence process helps us assess 
risks and opportunities from climate change 
on our investments, where applicable.
While Sandstorm has determined that climate-re-
lated issues are not likely to have a significant 
impact on the Company’s revenues in the short 
term, we recognize that climate-related risks 
could materialize in the medium to long-term. 
Sandstorm will be undertaking a scenario 
analysis in 2022 to consider long term risks and 
opportunities associated with climate change to 
strengthen our strategy and financial planning 
process. The results of this analysis will be 
included in our next Sustainability Report.
Climate Risks
When evaluating new royalty opportunities, 
Sandstorm employs multiple due diligence 
methods, which assists in determining climate 
risks ranging from both short-term to long-term. 
Sandstorm enters into agreements with 
mining partners that cover the life of the 
mines, often with our royalties outliving the 
operators of an asset. Accordingly, Sandstorm 
defines our time horizons in climate change 
risk management the following way:
 Ƚ Short term 
Under 5 years
 Ƚ Medium term
5-10 years
 Ƚ Long term
Greater than 10 yearsTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
The due diligence process is undertaken 
by Sandstorm’s management team, using a 
multi-disciplinary approach when evaluating 
potential transactions. The due diligence team 
consists of professionals with experience and 
expertise in the fields of geology, mining, metal-
lurgy, engineering, and finance. By conducting 
a robust and detailed due diligence process, 
Sandstorm endeavors to invest in projects with 
a relatively low ESG, and climate- related, risk. 
Where appropriate, the due diligence process will 
utilize the expertise of third-party consultants. 
During the due diligence process, climate risks 
and opportunities may be identified, including 
potential impacts to the investment related to 
physical and transition climate change risks. 
44
2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTThe table below outlines the physical and transition risks that could impact the operations of 
our partners and our Company’s results, many of which are considered throughout the due 
diligence process and through ongoing monitoring:
Category of Risk Description of Risk and Potential Financial Impact for our Partners Potential Financial impact for our Company
ACUTE PHYSICAL RISKS Extreme weather events caused by global warming, such as droughts, floods, 
hurricanes, etc. These events may lead to production delays and/or cessation of 
operations.Short term delay of revenues, with potential 
longer term elimination of revenues if opera-
tions ceased.
CHRONIC PHYSICAL RISKS Gradual shifts in weather conditions could lead to water scarcity, shifts in rain-
fall patterns, rising sea levels, etc. These shifts may lead to recurring production 
delays, cessations of operations and/or increased operating costs to adapt to 
climate changes. These results may lead to mines being abandoned or placed into 
care and maintenance if adaptation costs erode anticipated profitability. Longer-term and potentially recurring delays 
of revenues, long term impact to asset value 
including impairment. 
POLICY & LEGAL RISKS Policy & legal changes in a jurisdiction that seeks to promote adaptation to cli-
mate change and/or constrain the activities of operators and operations that 
contribute to adverse effects of climate change. These legislative and legal 
changes may require extensive capital expenditures by our partners to accommo-
date or conform to such changes, which may lead to projects being abandoned 
or placed into care and maintenance if such mandatory expenditures erode antic-
ipated profitability.Potential impairment of assets, delays of reve-
nues, and additional expenses to legal experts 
to ensure meeting legislative requirements. 
REPUTATIONAL RISKS Changing public perceptions of our partner’s climate-related activities and their 
contributions to or detractions from the transition to a low carbon economy. This 
may affect access to capital which may lead to projects changing hands or being 
temporarily or permanently abandoned.Delays of revenues, and impairment of assets. 
MARKET RISKS Shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities based on their real or per-
ceived impact on the climate. Reductions in commodity prices may impact our 
partner’s revenues and, in severe cases, render a project uneconomic, causing 
projects to be abandoned or placed into care and maintenance until commodity 
prices recover. Delays of revenue and lack of opportunities for 
future growth. Potential impairment of assets.

Risk Mitigation through  
Diversified Portfolio
Sandstorm has over 230 royalty and stream agree-
ments, therefore our exposure to climate-related 
risks is partially mitigated by our diversification. In 
2021, our revenue was made up from 26 producing 
partners, located in countries throughout the 
world. This helps mitigate both operator-specific 
risks, as well as localized climate-related risks. Our 
due diligence process is focused on identifying 
high-quality mine operators that share our 
values in responsible mining. While the majority 
of our revenue is generated through precious 
metals, including gold and silver, we also receive 
revenues from various commodity types produced 
in multiple jurisdictions, which helps mitigate 
risks impacting broader regions and markets. 
Climate Opportunities
The mining industry supplies commodities to 
sectors that are essential for the transition to a 
low carbon economy. Sandstorm is well positioned 
to participate in climate-related opportunities 
in connection with this transition. The following 
describes climate-related opportunities that we 
have within our portfolio, and that we expect 
will continue to be available to our company 
throughout the short, medium and long-term. 
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 Ƚ Copper
Copper is the best nonprecious metal con-
ductor of heat and electricity, and is already 
used in low carbon technologies such as wind,   North America 
  CANADA
  South America
  Other
  Precious Metals
  Base Metals
  Diamondssolar power, nuclear power, and electrical vehi-
cles. Therefore, it will play an important role in 
the decarbonization of the planet. 
Sandstorm currently receives copper from 
our Chapada mine, with Lundin Mining 
Corp. In 2021, Chapada made up 13% of total 
revenue. Strong demand for copper increases 
the prospects of greater production from this 
operation, which is currently anticipated to 
produce through to 2050. We expect in the 
future there will be significant opportunities 
for our company to finance copper operations 
with our recently announced strategic mining 
partner, Horizon Copper, which will have 
a focus on copper projects. Sandstorm and 
Horizon Copper may partner together in the 
future, whereby Sandstorm will purchase 
stream on the precious metals by-products 
from the copper project acquisitions made by 
Horizon Copper. 
 Ƚ Silver
Silver has proven to be invaluable across 
numerous applications, and is essential in the 
production of both solar panels and electrical 
vehicles. Silver is also used in electronics, 
alloying, chemical catalysts and photographic 
film. Due to its numerous uses, it will play a key 
role in transitioning from fossil fuels. 
Sandstorm currently receives silver from our 
Yamana silver stream, with Yamana Gold. In 
2021, the Yamana silver stream made up 22% of 
total revenue. Sandstorm will continue to look 
for opportunities to allocate capital into the 
silver space.Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures

2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Ƚ Operations
Sandstorm’s head office is situated in a LEED 
Gold certified building in Vancouver, British 
Columbia, Canada. The LEED rating system is 
recognized as the international mark of excel-
lence for green building in over 160 countries. 
As a LEED Gold certified building, specific 
measures are taken to reduce waste, conserve 
energy, and decrease water consumption. In 
Vancouver, 90% of the energy is supplied from 
renewable, clean energy sources, mainly using 
hydroelectric generation. 
While our direct environmental impact and 
carbon footprint is small, operating out of a 
sustainably designed building is a strategic 
decision to further minimize our impact on the 
environment. 
Risk Management
How the organization identifies, assesses, 
and manages climate-related risks 
Our Company does not operate mines, but instead 
provides upfront capital to mining operators, 
in exchange for a portion of the future metal or 
revenue from the mining operators, with the view 
of holding onto these interests for extended time 
horizons. Therefore, the key period for assessing 
and identifying ESG risks, including climate-re-
lated risks, is prior to making an investment with 
our partners. Accordingly, we have a due diligence 
process for potential operating partners. With over 
230 royalty and stream agreements, our due dili-
gence team has put in thousands of hours reviewing 
investment opportunities. This process involves utilizing the extensive experience of our manage-
ment team, technical team and Board of Directors 
to evaluate ESG and climate-related risks, where 
appropriate, specific to a mining operation and the 
plans adopted by the operator to manage risks. For 
a detailed description of our due diligence process, 
refer to pages 17–19 in our Sustainability Report. 
If ESG risks, including climate-related risks, 
identified in our due diligence process are 
assessed and deemed to be materially adverse to 
the prospects of the respective mine, this may 
result in Sandstorm’s decision not to proceed 
with an investment. Over the last several years, 
we have rejected over $500 million in potential 
transactions on the basis of ESG concerns. If we 
elect to proceed with an investment, we endeavour 
to include in our agreements, specific provisions 
that include reporting obligations, audit and 
inspection rights, etc. For further information, 
refer to page 19 in our Sustainability Report. 
Once we have acquired a royalty or stream 
agreement, we do not have control over the mines 
or their operations. Due to the nature of our 
business, we are exposed to other risks, which 
we may be unable to mitigate. For additional 
discussion on these risk factors, refer to the 
Company’s Annual Information Form dated March 
31, 2022, which is available on www.sedar.com
As discussed in our Governance section above, 
the Board of Directors meet with senior man-
agement to discuss our company’s ESG and/
or climate-related risks and exposures on a 
regular basis. This collaborative effort is aimed 
at defining our ESG and climate strategy going 
forward. This will be further informed by a detailed scenario analysis, which we are undertaking in 
2022. This process will consider how we can 
mitigate, transfer, or accept the identified risks. 
Metrics and Targets
The metrics and targets used to assess and 
manage relevant climate-related risks and 
opportunities, where such information is material
METRICS
Sandstorm has been reporting our Scope 2 
and relevant Scope 3 emissions in line with 
the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol through 
the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire since 
2019. As per our Sustainability Report, we 
have committed to being carbon neutral in 
our operations by 2035. Details on our Carbon 
Footprint, greenhouse gas emissions and our 
carbon-neutral commitment, are on pages 31–32 of 
our Sustainability Report. As a summary, for 2021, 
our Scope 2 GHG was 28.2 metric tonnes CO2 e, 
and Scope 3 GHG was 107.5 metric tonnes CO2 e.
TARGETS
Sandstorm is an office-based company with 24 
employees, therefore our carbon footprint is 
minimal. As a royalty company, we are not involved 
in, nor control, the operational decisions of the 
mine projects on which we have royalties or 
streams. Our targets used to assess and manage 
our climate-related risks and opportunities reflect 
this fact, with the focus on our own actions and 
initiatives. Our climate-related targets and 2021 
performance related to such targets are as follows:Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures

2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Ƚ Partnering with best-in-class partners
To ensure that we are partnering with high 
quality partners, Sandstorm has set the goal 
to have a percentage of our assets align with 
sustainability and climate related reporting 
standards and frameworks by the year 2025. 
2021 Performance: As outlined on page 21 of 
our Sustainability report, 82% of our producing 
partners are reporting under a sustainability 
reporting standard, and 59% of our producing 
partners are reporting under a climate related 
reporting standard. 
 Ƚ Carbon neutral
We aim to be carbon neutral for our direct 
Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, by the year 
2035.
2021 Performance: As discussed above, dis-
cussed above, for 2021, our Scope 2 emissions 
were 28.2 metric tonnes CO2 e, and Scope 3 
emissions were 107.5 metric tonnes CO2 e. We 
believe we are on track to becoming carbon 
neutral within our timeline. Ƚ Enhanced climate-related transparency
Sandstorm aims to be on the leading edge of 
the sustainability movement, and to continue 
to improve and increase the transparency 
in our sustainability reporting and continue 
to address climate-related issues that are 
important to our stakeholders.
2021 Performance: For 2021, we have 
significantly enhanced our climate-related 
disclosure, with the inclusion of our first-time 
TCFD-aligned climate disclosure. We have also 
seen improvement in our ratings with MSCI, 
moving from a “A” rating in 2020, to an “AA” 
rating in 2021. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
