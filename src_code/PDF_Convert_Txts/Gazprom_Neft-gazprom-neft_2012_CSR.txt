2012 SuSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 5
In 2012, Gazprom Neft reaffirmed its reputation as one of the most 
efficient Russian oil and gas companies. Hydrocarbon production by Gazprom Neft increased by more than 4%, the volume of refining by 
7% and revenues grew by 19.5%.
In the past year, the Company continued to expand its operations in 
Russia and globally. It has consolidated its assets in a new region, the 
Orenburg Region, received a license for the major Novoportovskoye 
field in the north of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District, extracted its first oil as part of another new project, the Messoyakhskoe field, and increased production at the Priobskoye field in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous District (Yugra). The Company’s portfolio was 
strengthened by the addition of new assets outside Russia, namely, in 
the Middle East.
In oil refining, the Company is implementing large-scale programs to 
upgrade its production facilities and to introduce new technologies 
that enable it not only to improve the quality of products, but also to minimize their environmental footprint. Starting from 2013, Gazprom Neft intends to switch over to producing gasoline and diesel fuel of high environmental classes only that meet the Euro-4 and Euro-5 
standards. Gazprom Neft’s efficiency can be seen not only in its 
performance against operating and financial performance indicators, but also in the results of its social and environmental activities. The Company successfully implemented projects to improve operational safety, and allocated significant resources to provide healthcare, training and social support for its employees.Gazprom Neft supports government authorities and local communities in their challenge to meet the most pressing demands of social development in the regions where the Company operates. In 
2012, total Company expenditure on social projects in these 
regions amounted to 2.4 billion rubles. Gazprom Neft’s social and environmental programs make a significant contribution to the sustainable development of its operating regions, creating a 
favourable environment and improving the quality of life.
Gazprom Neft’s strategic approach to the challenges of sustainable 
development and high social responsibility are the very factors that strengthen the Company’s reputation and competitiveness in its 
global markets, and help it to achieve its objectives as set out in its 
Development Strategy.ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN OF

ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD
The past year, 2012, was another record year for Gazprom Neft. The 
Company not only fully implemented its plans, but also reached, ahead of schedule, a number of performance targets set by its Development 
Strategy for the period up to 2020. As of the end of 2012, Gazprom 
Neft was the leading company among the largest vertically integrated oil companies in Russia in terms of production growth rates. At the same time, the Company remains one of the industry leaders in terms 
of efficiency.
In the past year, the Company continued to modernize its refining 
assets to improve the quality of its oil products. In 2012, Gazprom Neft became the largest supplier of light petroleum products to the 
Russian market.
The Company invests in the development of all areas of its business, 
providing a platform for further, and sustainable, growth. Gazprom 
Neft places great importance on employee relations. One of its basic 
principles is to give its employees a wide range of opportunities for a rewarding, professional development. In 2012, the Company’ s 
investment in employee training amounted to 168.3 million rubles and 80% of its employees participated in various training 
programs. During the year, online training and professional employee 
development systems were developed significantly. The Company maintains an ongoing dialog with employees, involving them in joint solving of strategic tasks. For the past three years, Gazprom Neft has held corporate forums – an effective platform for sharing views and strengthening the corporate culture.
Gazprom Neft aims to be an efficient social investor. During the 
reporting year, the Company adopted the ‘Home Towns’ social investment program which aims at further developing toolsto involve both local communities and the Company’s employees in the process of shaping the portfolio of projects, and in directly implementing social programs.
Under this program, Gazprom Neft invested in the development of 
social infrastructure in the regions where it operates.  Among the largest projects in 2012 were the construction of the Avangard 
Hockey Academy in Omsk and the opening of the Zenith sports 
complex in Noyabrsk.
Another Company priority is to ensure safe production and 
environmental protection through the introduction of an integrated 
system for managing industrial safety, occupational health and 
environmental protection at Gazprom Neft’s production facilities. In 2012, the Company took a number of steps to protect the air, reduce water pollution risks, reclaim land, and maintain biodiversity. The total 
amount invested in ecological safety reached approximately 3.4 billion 
rubles.

Gazprom Neft makes a wide range of petroleum products and 
petrochemicals. Its key product lines include motor gasolines and diesel fuels, oils, construction and road bitumens, marine fuels, 
boiler oils (mazut), jet fuel, paraffin and wax products, as well as a 
variety of aromatic hydrocarbons, liquefied hydrocarbon gases and catalysts.
The Company’s main priorities in making petroleum products are 
increasing production efficiency, improving the environmental performance of fuels, increasing the oil conversion ratio, and increasing the throughput and product mix (high-octane gasolines, diesel fuels, aromatic hydrocarbons, coke, advanced bituminous 
materials and petrochemicals).
The main areas of development for the Moscow Refinery are 
increasing the oil conversion ratio (construction of the facility for 
vacuum gas oil hydrocracking, flexicoking plant), improving product 
quality (construction of a combined oil refining plant, including the crude desalter unit ELOU-AVT-6, diesel fuel hydrotreatement unit and continuous catalytic reforming unit (CCR)), and carrying out environmental programs to reduce environmental impact. Since 2012, the Moscow Refinery has produced only Euro-4 and Euro-5 
motor fuels. In 2012, it put into operation a mechanical treatment 
plant (MTP). Since the launch of the MTP, oil content in effluent has dropped from 9.2 mg/l to 1.5 mg/l (i.e. by 81.5%) while solids content has decreased from 14 mg/l to 6 mg/l (i.e. by 57.1%). By 
2020, Gazprom Neft plans to have invested over 130 billion rubles in 
the development of the Moscow Refinery.OMSK OIL REFINERYThe World Refineries Association (WRA)
10 recognized Gazprom 
Neft’s Omsk Refinery as the best in Russia and the CIS in 2012, praising the projects implemented at the plant under its

GAZPROM NEFT GROuP
2012 SuSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 28
Gazprom Neft is actively introducing new technologies at all stages, 
from exploration to refining and petroleum products sales, and is conducting its own development in innovation, in conjunction 
with major research institutions. Using more innovation in priority 
business areas is a prerequisite for the Company’s successful long-term development. The attention paid to this topic by the Board of Directors is testament to the strategic importance of innovation to 
the Company.
In October 2012, the Board of Directors examined the forecasted 
impact of adopting new production technologies. According to Gazprom Neft experts, the use of innovative solutions at the 
Company’s existing fields can ensure an additional extraction of 700-
950 million tonnes of oil.
To generate and effectively use new technological developments, 
Gazprom Neft has created and is cultivating a technology 
management system, which enables it to monitor and adopt new technologies, and to gain and share knowledge and expertise within the Company. Gazprom Neft has agreed to set up a Regional Competence Center (RCC) in all its subsidiaries and affiliates to 
work on key technological challenges. The RCCs will become the 
centers for the sharing of advanced technologies and best practices among the Gazprom Neft subsidiaries and affiliates. To date, the 
Company has four RCCs: at Gazprom Neft-Khantos, Gazprom Neft-Vostok, Gazprom Neft-Muravlenko branch and Gazprom 
Neft-Noyabrskneftegaz.
A Joint Scientific and Research Center for Innovation Technologies 
(JSRC) established by Gazprom Neft Science and Technology Center
11 
in collaboration with the Saint Petersburg State Mining University (SPSMU) was opened on February 2, 2012. The JSRC will focus on 
the development of innovative physical and chemical stimulation 
techniques, introduction of new hydraulic fracturing methods, development and testing of drilling muds, and control of corrosion and bio-corrosion of metals. The JSRC has, as its base, eight scientific 
research laboratories fitted with the latest equipment. Along with 
Gazprom Neft STC and SPSMU employees, the Center’s scientific and Between 2013 and 2020, the Company plans to invest over 15 billion rubles in the innovative development of its upstream sector. According to some forecasts, by 2020 more than 50% of all oil will 
be produced by using new technologies.
Innovation
11 LLC Gazprom Neft Science and Technology Center is a subsidiary of JSC Gazprom Neft, 
responsible for engineering of reservoirs, scientific and technical support of oil and gas 
production, improvement of the efficiency of reservoir development and expansion of Gazprom 
Neft’s mineral resources base.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP
2012 SuSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 29
research activities will actively involve students and postgraduates 
from the Mining University. JSRC’s projects will significantly shorten the timescale from the proposal of scientific and technological ideas 
to the implementation of innovative technologies at Gazprom Neft 
enterprises. About 20 million rubles were spent by Gazprom Neft to equip JSRC’s laboratory complex. Another 30 million rubles were spent on conducting joint research with SPSMU between 2009 and 
2011.
The focus on research and development in innovation reflects 
the priorities of progressing the Company’s major business areas. For the upstream sector, priority issues include improving 
the efficiency of oil production at the depleted resource base of 
traditional deposits, developing the new regions of Yamal, East Siberia, accessing offshore zones, including those in the Arctic seas, implementing foreign projects, developing unconventional sources 
of hydrocarbons, reducing the environmental load, and energy 
saving. In 2012, the Company enlarged its portfolio of innovative projects to address these priority tasks.Innovative solutions significantly increase the efficiency of business. 
For example, in 2012, the implementation of multistage HRF
12 
in horizontal wells resulted in an average daily oil increase in 
production to 79.2 tonnes per day.
Additional oil extraction as of January 1, 2013 amounted to 640.6 
thousand tonnes. Spudding in of side-holes at Gazprom Neft’s deposits of the 3rd and 4th stages of development in complex 
geologic conditions enabled hard-to-extract and residual stocks to 
be accessed. As a result, an additional 233.1 thousand tonnes of oil were produced.
The introduction of rotary steerable systems (next-generation 
downhole drilling tools) has reduced capital costs by 1.4%, while 
contributing to 0.5 million tonnes of additional hydrocarbon extraction.
Gazprom Neft also uses the benefits of innovation in collaborative 
projects with major international oil and gas companies. In the past year, Salym Petroleum Development – a joint company of Gazprom Neft and Shell – launched a pilot project for alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) flooding to increase oil recovery in the West Salym 
field.
In 2012, the Inter-Agency Committee for Technological 
Development within the Presidium of the Presidential Council 
on Economic Modernization and Innovative Development of 
the Russian Federation approved the Program of Gazprom Neft Innovative Development in Oil Refining and Petrochemical Production up to 2020. The Program defines the principles and key performance indicators for innovation management in logistics, 
processing and marketing, as well as the main areas for improving 
innovative technologies in oil refining and petrochemical production. These areas include improving product quality (in particular, the reduction of sulphur and aromatics content in gasoline and diesel 
fuels), increasing the oil conversion ratio, developing new products, 
and increasing the efficiency and environmental sustainability of production.
R&D in oil refining and petrochemical production is carried out 
in partnership with the leading Russian research institutions that 
specialize in technological areas that are a priority for Gazprom Neft.
The Company’s partners include the Topchiev Institute of 
Petrochemical Synthesis, Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas, Institute of Hydrocarbon Processing SB RAS (Siberian Branch According to the Strategy for Development of Innovation and Scientific Research in Oil Refining and Petrochemical Production up to 2020, the Company has made provisions for the funding 
of R&D in oil refining and petrochemical production of up to 450 
million rubles annually until 2015.In January 2012, in collaboration with a team of consultants from Schlumberger, the Company launched the project of the Center of Geological Support for construction of high-tech wells. As of the 
beginning of 2013, the Center will support drilling of such wells in 
fields developed by JSC Gazprom Neft-Noyabrskneftegaz, Gazprom Neft-Muravlenko branch, Gazprom Neft-Khantos, Gazprom Neft Orenburg, and Gazprom Neft-Development.A large-scale innovation project (undertaken jointly with the Institute of Hydrocarbon Processing, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences) is the development and introduction 
of bizeolit catalysts for catalytic cracking at the Gazprom Neft-
Omsk Refinery. The introduction of the new catalyst helped the Omsk Refinery to increase the yield of light oil products, improve the oil conversion ratio and reduce the sulphur content in the 
product, while cutting its operating costs. Gazprom Neft is currently 
the largest domestic manufacturer of microsphere catalysts for catalytic cracking. In 2012, the corporate author at the Gazprom Neft-Omsk Refinery received three positive opinions for patents on new brands of cracking catalysts.

In 2012, both major long-term innovation projects aimed at 
the development of strategically important technologies (oil tar hydrocracking with nanoscale catalysts, solid acid alkylation, etc.), and R&D projects that meet the technology needs of specific 
refineries were implemented at the Company’s refineries.In 2012, the Company initiated a work schedule for the production 
of high-quality components for motor fuels, which is expected (among others) to result in the development of in-house high-
performance catalysts for diesel fraction isodewaxing and 
oligomerization and the development of a technology for the processing of low-octane fractions (raffinates) into high-octane motor gasoline components (isomerizate) yielding at least 90%. 
Research work was carried out to develop new formulations of 
bitumen, including polymer-bitumen binders.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP

RISK MANAGEMENT
Gazprom Neft has a Risk Management Policy that defines the goals 
and principles of risk management in order to make the Company’s business more secure in both the short and the long term. The 
Company’s goal in risk management is to ensure that Gazprom Neft 
can achieve its strategic goals, as far as possible, by identifying and guarding against risks, and by putting effective mechanisms in place to deal with them. 
Gazprom Neft’s risk management system ensures the smooth 
operation of the Company’s production and business processes by anticipating threats and mitigating the impact of adverse external and internal factors.
The Company has developed and formalized a uniform approach to 
handling risk management processes, which is fully contained in the ‘Integrated Risk Management System’ (IRMS) corporate standard.
Gazprom Neft’s IRMS is a systematic, continuous process that 
identifies, assesses and manages risks.
Its key principle is that responsibility for the management of 
various risks is assigned to various management levels depending 
on the expected financial impact of the specific risks.
As of late 2011, the Company had implemented basic IRMS 
processes at most of its major subsidiaries and affiliates, and was 
thus able to develop a detailed corporate risk map for 2011 by consolidating risk events from individual subsidiary and affiliate levels to the entire Company. In 2012, the scope of the IRMS was extended as the portfolio grew, with 11 new assets in the Exploration and Production Segment (EPS) and 4 assets added to the Logistics, Refinement and Sales Segment (LRSS).
This approach made it possible to outline responsibility areas 
for risk management and monitoring at every level of corporate management, and to have customised response plans to address material risks at each subsidiary/affiliate and throughout the 
Company. Risk-related hierarchical structures for the key EPS 
business areas (production, industrial safety, procurement, projects) have been developed along the same lines for the LRSS key business areas (refinement, sales). This approach enables consistency in the regular re-evaluation of risks, and analysis of 
root risk factors that impact the achievement of financial targets.
The Company continuously works to improve its basic IRMS 
processes with particular emphasis on efforts to assess risks and 
integrate risk management processes into key corporate processes 
such as business planning, project management and M&A.The company’s risk management goal is to further safeguard the achievement of strategic objectives through early detection and prevention of risks and the use of effective 
measures to mitigate them. 
The Company’s risk management scope encompasses both the financial risks and risks of an environmental and social nature. The mitigation of the latter is the objective of the 
corporate policies and management systems in the areas 
of environmental protection, occupational safety, human resources and regional development
20.Effective risk management  
is a key component of sustainability 
management.

RISKS ASSOCIATED  WITH CHANGES  IN TAX LAWSGazprom Neft is one of the largest taxpayers in the Russian Federation; it pays federal taxes, regional and local taxes, including the value-added tax, corporate income tax, mineral extraction taxes, corporate property taxes and land taxesIn the course of its business, the Company constantly monitors all changes in tax law, and changes in the interpretation and application of existing tax law. The Company also advises the Government on improving legislation and on creating new regulatory acts in the field of taxation.
RISKS RELATED TO CHANGES INLICENSE COMPLIANCE FOR MAINBUSINESS LINESSub-soil legislation is evolving towards detailed regulation of sub-soil usage by the Government, more rational use of sub-soil areas, and strict compliance with legal standards for environmental protection.Gazprom Neft operates its license areas in strict conformity with the requirements of Russian sub-soil law, and updates its license agreements to keep them compliant with relevant laws. The Company analyzes and assesses legislative initiatives by relevant ministries and departments in the sphere of sub-soil law and licensing. Gazprom Neft is not aware of any legal risks associated with the loss of sub-soil rights or violation of current law due to changes in the law.
ENVIRONMENTAL  RISKS Gazprom Neft’s operations have an inherent risk of damage to or pollution of the natural environment.

In 2012, all major subsidiaries created plans to change the 
corporate culture, taking into account the specific characteristics of each enterprise. In order to build a unified, results-oriented 
corporate culture the Company selected several key areas or ‘levers’. 
These include the development of management by objectives (MBO) system, the creation of internal economic competition, and the use of new management methods, such as “management 
by walking around”
21. These ‘levers’ are intended to improve business performance through more effective goal setting, internal competition, and opportunities for the Company’s managers to 
personally take part in the day-to-day work lives of employees. The “levers” also include the establishment of a feedback system and the communication of values. Such a large-scale transformation 
is impossible without the active participation of top executives. 
The most important element of the change process is the personal example set by top managers.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
The Company engages with its stakeholders22 based on the principles of transparency, regularity 
and reliability of the information that it provides. The main priorities of stakeholder engagement 
are stated in the corporate regulations (the Corporate Code of Conduct, the Corporate Code, and documents governing individual business areas). 
Following the recommendations of ISO 26000:2010 (‘Guidance on 
Social Responsibility’), the Company is committed to respecting the interests of its stakeholders – not just those who may be connected 
to the Company’s own goals and commitments, but also those with 
the interests of society as a whole.
The Company identifies a number of key stakeholder groups whose 
interests are most noticeably linked with its activities and who, in 
turn, can have the most significant impact on the Company’s ability to implement its strategic goals:
 ●Shareholders and investors;
 ●Public authorities;
 ●Personnel;
 ●Business partners, suppliers and customers;
 ●Local communities.
In forming its approaches to shareholder engagement the Company 
takes into account the level and scale of the relationships (federal, 
regional or local), as well as the extent of formalization (informal/fixed in the contracts or other documents). As the interests of the various stakeholders do not always coincide, the Company seeks to build a 
balanced approach to stakeholder engagement.Gazprom Neft constantly analyzes its internal and external social 
environment and changes the agenda for shareholder engagement taking into account its strategic goals and the priorities of its stakeholders. In 2012, the Company continued to develop a detailed 
stakeholder map to gain a more exact understanding of the value 
of each stakeholder group (and their sub-divisions) in the context of the Company’s strategy. The Company takes steps to involve stakeholders in the implementation of its projects. This allows the Company to adjust the progress of projects according to stakeholders’ 
expectations and to identify and eliminate existing risks in good time. 
For example, a distinction is made within the Company’s HR structure between operating personnel, various levels of management, and 
young professionals, whereas the ‘local communities’ category is sub-
divided into groups such as school leavers and students, war veterans, indigenous peoples of Northern Russia, and public associations specializing in environmental and social work.STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

its competitiveness. The Company regularly reviews customer 
requirements and satisfaction levels, and considers its customers as important partners in establishing programs aimed to improve product quality and environmental safety.
In 2013, Russia will no longer be allowed to sell fuel of classes lower 
than Euro-3. The implementation of quality programs at Gazprom 
Neft’s refineries allowed the Company to achieve this milestone ahead 
of time.
Gazprom Neft promotes the adoption of international standards in the 
Russian market not only in the area of fuel quality, but also in the quality 
of services. For example, Gazprom Neft-Aero, a company that provides refuelling services for aircrafts, was one of the first companies in Russia to insure against risks associated with possible compensation for damage 
to third parties and the environment. Since 2008, Gazprom Neft-Aero has been a strategic partner to the International Air Transport Association 
(IATA) for refuelling services.

(totalling 500 outlets) – Auchan, Carrefour, and PUNTO LEGNO. At the 
end of 2012, the Russian market share of Gazprom Neft-Lubricants had increased from 13 to 14%. Sales of G-Family premium oils have risen by times.
An important part of customer engagement is the system for 
responding to customer dissatisfaction with the quality of products or services. The Company has a claims settlement mechanism based on the corporate-wide document – ‘Methodical Guidelines for 
Handling Inconsistencies during Sales of OP, LHG and AG&S at Filling 
Stations’

Gazprom Neft actively supports the development of commodity 
exchange sales of petroleum products in Russia, viewing it as a 
mechanism to ensure fair and transparent pricing and sales of petroleum products. 
In 2012, the Company sold over 2 million tonnes of oil products through 
exchange trading, which accounted for 14.5% of the Company’s sales in the domestic market and 7.5% of its manufactured petroleum products. The Novoportovskoye and Messoyakhskoye deposits are located in a remote area of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area, reachable only by road in winter. In winter, cargo has to 
travel along an average of 250 km of roads to reach the fields. 
An analysis of logistics for winter 2011 was the starting point for establishing new requirements for potential contractors. Gazprom Neft-Snabzhenie, a procurement company, held a 
conference in Tyumen focused on working with contractors 
for the transportation of material and technical resources to existing Company facilities and to the Novy Port and Messoyakha projects. The conference brought together major players in the transportation and warehousing market. The 
central topic of the conference was long-term cooperation. The 
system of long-term contracts is under development and is likely to be offered to contractors next year.In May 2012, the Omsk Refinery commissioned a unit for gasoline hydrotreating by catalytic cracking. In June, it started the production of Euro-4 and Euro-5 motor gasoline AI-95, 
AI-92. In December, it introduced a unit for hydrotreating of 
diesel fuel and started the production of Euro-5 diesel fuel.

potential of the regions and creating a favourable social environment 
for the implementation of the Company’s strategy. Gazprom Neft actively engages with local communities in the development and implementation of social programs that it supports. In 2012, the

In the process of devising and implementing social projects, the 
Company regularly amends and improves its methods of engagement 
with local communities, which includes:
 ●Identification of the main project target groups;
 ●Verification that the project’s objectives correspond with the expectations of the community;
 ●Definition of channels for ensuring awareness of the project;
 ●Identification of opportunities to involve local residents in the planning and implementation of the project;
 ●Evaluation of the effectiveness of the implemented project,
During the reporting year, the Company took an inventory of its social 
projects portfolio, which identified the most successful practices tried 
and tested by the Company in various regions over the period from 2007 to 2012. This can serve as a model to spread throughout the Company’s area of operation.
During its engagement program with local communities, the Company 
maintains an ongoing dialog with stakeholders such as:
 ●Local authorities,
 ●Public organizations,
 ●Educational, medical and cultural institutions,
 ●Company employees,
 ●Local residents,
 ●Indigenous peoples of Northern Russia.
An important factor for effective engagement with local communities 
is the regular and wide circulation of information about the 
Company’s activities. Main topics discussed include the Company’s environmental footprint, development of social infrastructure in the regions and preservation of cultural traditions.
Gazprom Neft regularly carries out social monitoring in the regions 
where it operates. In 2012, it designed a program of sociological research, which in March 2013 was launched in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area – Yugra, and 
the Orenburg and Omsk Regions. The aim of the research was to 
identify the main expectations of local communities with regard to the Company’s activities in the regions and to evaluate current social 
investment projects, proposals for the development of corporate 
volunteering and charitable activities.The studies included:
 ●Surveying of local residents;
 ●Expert interviews with representatives of regional and local authorities and public organisations’ activists;
 ●Focus groups with employees of the Company, public organisations’ activists, and locals.
The research allowed the Company to assess the effectiveness and relevance of social programs in its operating regions, as well as to identify opportunities to engage both Company employees and local residents in social and charity projects.
Focusing on the needs and expectations of local communities allows the 
Company to successfully implement social programs that are of strategic importance to the region and as well as to the Company. An example is Gazprom Neft’s program to promote healthy lifestyles and create a 
modern sports infrastructure in the regions, which was met with a very 
warm response from the local residents
26.
The presence of Gazprom Neft’s facilities in areas inhabited by the 
indigenous peoples of Northern Russia imposes additional social and 
environmental obligations on the Company, making it necessary for it to steer a middle course between the expansion of industrial production and the preservation of the areas for the traditional life of the peoples 
of Northern Russia. When planning its activities, the Company enables 
discussions to take place with representatives of the indigenous peoples on ways to minimize the effects of industrial activities on their traditional way of life (for example, the location of pipelines, making special paths for deer, etc.).In its cooperation with local communities, the Company abides by the following principles:
 –Balance between strategic goals and priorities of regional 
development;
 –Regular and systemic collaboration in addressing pressing 
social and environmental challenges in the regions;
 –Transparency of decision-making.The population of the indigenous peoples of Northern Russia in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area, one of the Company’s main operating regions, is just over 41 thousand 
people, of which 17 thousand lead a nomadic life. Most of the 
indigenous population are engaged in traditional activities such as reindeer herding, fishing and hunting. It is the world’s largest area for reindeer, which number over 600 thousand. 
The programs actively supported by the Company take into 
account the unique historical and cultural characteristics of the area and great care is taken to ensure that the Company’s strategic plan reflects the interests of the indigenous peoples.  
The programs support cultural and educational events and aim 
to preserve the unique culture of the indigenous peoples of 
Yamal.

DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING
In line with corporate reporting global trends and drawing on the 
experience gained by integrating the annual and sustainability reporting process, the Company is considering the possibility of 
preparing and publishing an integrated corporate report in the future.
The Company has considered and implemented the principles of 
sustainable development reporting as set out in the International 
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative
27. 
The Company endeavours to consistently improve the quality of its 
reports. In 2011 (during the preparation of the 2010 Sustainability 
Report) GRI confirmed the Company’s compliance with GRI  level 
B requirements. In the course of preparing the 2011 Report, the Joint Working Group assessed the Company’s compliance with the provisions of ISO 26000 and the application of the approaches, as 
recommended by the Standard, to the organization of its activities in 
accordance with the principles of responsible business practices. 
The Company considers its ISO 26000-based internal assessment to 
be an essential component of continuous improvement of its activities 
in sustainable development and social responsibility. 
This work continued in 2012. The assessment covered the 
management systems for sustainable development and corporate 
social responsibility. The Company improved its analysis of practical 
engagement with local communities. The contents of the Report were also expanded to include the set of topics defined by ISO 26000.
The relevance of core topics, defined by ISO 26000 to the Company, 
were assessed on the following criteria:
 ●Importance for the Company;
 ●Importance for key stakeholders;
 ●Importance in terms of social context and business commitments, 
including those contained in international (UN Global Compact) and Russian documents (Social Charter of Russian Business).
The core topics of primary importance for the stakeholders were defined based on the analysis of feedback, sociological studies, media monitoring and focus groups as well as in the course of direct dialog as 
part of specific activities of the Company. Their key issues are reflected 
in the Report’s contents.
The 2012 Report has expanded its coverage of sustainable 
development leadership and management, as well as of stakeholder 
engagement issues. The presentation of the Company’s future 
objectives has been widened to include a number of specific measurable parameters.Gazprom Neft publishes its Sustainable 
Development Reports annually. Since 2008, it has synchronized the drafting of its Sustainable Development Report with the Annual Report through a Joint Working Group. This allows the reports to be published simultaneously, facilitates a consistent improvement in the quality of sustainable development and social responsibility reporting and ensures that this information is presented in a wider strategic context. 
27 For detailed information on the application of the principles, see Gazprom Neft’s Sustainable 
Development Report 2010.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP
2012 SuSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 58
To improve the quality and credibility of the Report, the Company 
considers it necessary to engage with stakeholders in the course of its  
preparation. In 2012, the Company started the practice of discussing 
publically its performance information prepared for inclusion in 
the Report. For example, during the preparation of the Sustainable Development Report for 2012, the Company presented its strategy for  
building the portfolio of social projects at the open corporate seminar 
‘Management of Social Projects’ at the European University in Saint 
Petersburg (March 26, 2012), which was attended by representatives of major Russian companies, Russian and international business associations, NPOs and expert communities.
The following issues were discussed:
 ●Priorities of the Company’s social policy;
 ●Key problems of building a social project portfolio;
 ●New formats to promote the Company’s social programs and their 
expected outcome.
The 2012 Report was subject to an independent public affirmation by the Council for Non-Financial Statements of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. In the future, the Company plans to complement this procedure with external auditing.In 2012, NIS, a part of Gazprom Neft, published its second Sustainable Development Report. Similar to Gazprom Neft’s sustainable development corporate reports, NIS prepares its 
reports based on GRI Guidelines. During the preparation of 
the Report, NIS took part in active dialog with stakeholders including representatives of the state and municipal authorities, business organizations, sports and cultural 
institutions, and public organizations. Through this process 
NIS identified the most important topics, such as protection of employees’ health and the environment, personnel policy and responsibility in the supply chain. The Report demonstrated notable progress against a number of key indicators. For 
example, during the year, the number of injuries at work 
decreased by almost 25%, the amount of particle emissions at the refinery in Pančevo dropped three-fold, and a number of key eco-infrastructure facilities worth around 20 million euros 
were renovated or constructed from scratch. The company 
spent about 2 million euros on the training and development of its employees — twice the amount spent the year before.ESSENTIAL

decreased by around 7% due to the restructuring of the business. The Group has completed the process of removing a number of oilfield 
service companies from the Group, which began in 2011.
The restructuring of Sibir Energy was also accomplished – a number 
of its constituent companies were sold, while some others were 
attached to the core business areas of Gazprom Neft Group.
Meanwhile, the headcount as of December 31, 2012, remained at the 
previous year’s level (more than 57,000 people), reflecting the gradual build-up of assets, as well as the development  of companies that had 
already joined the Group. For example, mining enterprises located in 
the city of Orenburg, Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District and Tomsk Region joined the Group in 2012. In addition, the extension of a chain of companies which sell petroleum products and aviation fuel is under 
way. The turnover rate in 2012 was 15.4% (15.8% in 2011).
Gazprom Neft is introducing advanced techniques of organizational 
development, allowing the Company to maintain optimal staffing levels to achieve goals that have been set, and to reduce labor costs 
by introducing new technologies in the field of computer-aided 
manufacturing.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP

POLICY & MANAGEMENT
Gazprom Neft continues to pursue a policy of equal opportunities, 
respects the rights of its employees and ensures equal opportunities for them to develop their abilities. All employees and job candidates 
are given equal opportunities to fulfil their personal goals. HR 
decisions are based entirely on employee qualifications and professional skills, his/her work achievements and business needs. Filling vacant positions with internal candidates is a widely applied 
practice which reduces recruitment costs and time spent adjusting 
to new roles. In addition, this practice provides greater career development opportunities for employees across the Group, as it allows them to demonstrate their abilities and skills in new disciplines and at different management levels.
The current in-house regulatory documents and programs for social 
and labor relations as well as the Collective Agreement have been drawn up in strict compliance with the Russian Constitution and 
Russian laws, including the Russian Labour Code, and do not contain 
provisions that lead to inequality based on gender, age or otherwise, that are not stipulated by the current law (which contains restrictions on the employment of women and young persons under 18 for certain heavy-duty or dangerous jobs). The Company monitors and supervises 
the adherence to the labor laws through its officials; there are 
The key principles of the Company’s Employee 
Policy are stated in Gazprom Neft’s Corporate Code. The Company respects individual freedom, rights and qualities, prevents any form of discrimination or harassment, and requires the same of its employees.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP

 procedures for monitoring compliance with the Company’s obligations 
under the Collective Agreement.
The Company has adopted its HR management strategy until 2020, 
which ensures that work in this area is aligned with the¬ overall corporate strategy. The HR management strategy covers both the 
optimum use of human resources to achieve the Company’s strategic 
goals and the system of measures to meet the socio-economic expectations, needs and interests of its employees. The mechanisms for implementing the Strategy include employee selection and 
recruitment, creation of a succession pool, compensation package 
management, evaluation of employee performance, organization of training and development, and improvement of HR management 
efficiency. At the same time, the Company strives to carry out this 
work to ensure there is a clear relation between the processes of assessment, development and recruitment, and staff turnover. The general goals of the Strategy are incorporated into specific objectives at the Company’s production units.
In 2012, the Company completed the relocation of the Group 
Corporate Center and head offices of Gazprom Neft-Aero, Gazprom Neft Business Service and Gazprom Neft Marine Bunker from 
Moscow to Saint Petersburg. This gradual move of the head offices 
of Gazprom Neft’s subsidiaries to Saint Petersburg facilitates better interaction between the Corporate Center and the subsidiaries, the creation of a single team and the promotion of the unified corporate culture.
In 2012, the Company continued its efforts to improve its incentives 
and compensation system and to establish a system to manage the labor efficiency of its employees.
The employee performance management system uses a number of 
indicators for different management levels and a number of individual targets for each employee that make it possible to assess quickly and monitor the efficiency of an employee’s work. The Company continues to introduce the system of regular employee assessment that complements the performance management system with an annual employee assessment using universal professional, 
ethical and management-related criteria. The professional criteria 
assess the employees’ quality of work; ethical criteria account for the employees’ attitude towards their work; whereas the criteria specially developed for managers assess management competencies. The 
assessment results are taken into account in career planning and 
inclusion in the succession pool, and also affect the revision of wages and the level of annual bonus.
In 2012, the Company performed a pilot employee assessment at the 
Corporate Center, the results of which were used to revise wages. 
The 2013 results of the Corporate Center employee assessment will be used to revise salaries and to define annual bonuses. In addition, the Company has scheduled a pilot cycle of regular performance 
and potential assessments in its 15 upstream and six downstream 
subsidiaries and affiliates for 2013, based on the results of 2012. All of Gazprom Neft’s core enterprises have implemented the grading system, which makes it possible to introduce clear and transparent principles of employee compensation, training, and assessment which 
are standard across all enterprises.In 2012, Gazprom Neft adopted ‘The Principles of Business 
Conduct for HR’. This is based on the Corporate Code and values (which are outlined in this document) and specify the 
basic principles for running the HR departments. One of the 
key principles is: ‘We are building mutual relations through a unified values system. The Company endeavours to be the employer of choice, welcomes the initiatives and personal 
contributions of each employee in achieving its strategic 
goals and creates equal opportunities for professional and personal growth.’ This document is binding for all HR departments of the Corporate Center, subsidiaries and affiliates of Gazprom Neft.
The system of management by objectives, which has been adopted, allows the Company to measure the performance of every employee and assess his/her contribution to the 
common cause. The idea of this system is to break up the 
Company’s strategic goals into individual objectives for units, directorates, departments, divisions and enterprises, and convert them into specific goals and targets for employees. 
This helps the Company to assess the extent to which 
strategic and operational goals are being achieved.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP

In conjunction with the geographical expansion of the business, 
the Company has developed and is introducing a unified concept of employee relocation, i.e. the human resources required for 
implementing major projects, including those in foreign countries. The 
concept defines the procedure for moving employees to work in the regions of Russia and abroad and the rules on compensations and benefits, to further motivate relocated employees.
The HR organizational structure includes the HR Department of 
the Corporate Center (as a part of the Organizational Issues Block), the HR Administrations in the production units and HR divisions in the subsidiaries and affiliates. These structural units, each at 
their respective levels, are responsible for implementing strategic 
programs, improving the Company’s human resources and supporting activities in all areas of personnel management.In 2012, to improve the communications across the HR management hierarchy, the Company has started to distribute roles and powers across the HR departments of the Corporate Center, subsidiaries 
and affiliates, and to describe the authorities of senior management 
and collective management bodies in the context of personnel management.

REMUNERATION & SOCIAL GUARANTEES
The Company is building a comprehensive incentive system based on 
competitive salaries, bonuses and a social component. This system is focused on implementing the Company’s business strategy and 
promoting good employee performance.
The company keeps up-to-date with market average wages in 
terms of the sectorial labor market. Wages and salaries are revised 
annually. The total average wage growth since 2009 has been 35%. 
In 2012, the average salary of the Company’s employees was RUB 59,828, practically the same as in 2011. Personnel expenses in 2012 amounted to RUB 42.3 billion, which is 6.7% less than in the previous year.
Gazprom Neft also places special emphasis on non-material 
incentives. The Company has developed the concept of non-material incentives, serving as a basis for systematic work in this direction. 
The current system of incentive measures adopted by Gazprom Neft allows employees to feel that the Company appreciates their work and contribution to the collective success. It includes 
professional competitions, sports and recreational activities, and corporate communications sessions. The Company annually awards two kinds of honorary titles, which are corporate merit badges for 
work: ‘Honored Worker of Gazprom Neft’ and ‘Veteran of Gazprom 
Neft.’ These titles are assigned as part of an awards campaign; the awarding procedure is regulated by the corporate standard ‘Procedure for Arranging Award Campaigns.’

development and has a unified corporate culture.
The Company’s enterprises have adopted collective agreements 
and other regulations and rules setting various social benefits for employees above and beyond those set by law. The social packages 
for most enterprises incorporate voluntary health insurance, accident 
insurance, free meals, financial aid, holiday vouchers and other benefits. Under the corporate voluntary health insurance agreement, the Company’s employees obtain expert medical advice, and, if

WORKING WITH TRADE UNIONS
The interregional trade union organization within the Company 
represents the employees’ position in respect of labor relations and the Company’s socio-economic strategy.
Mutual Company and employee obligations in respect of socio-
economic issues are reflected in collective agreements. The standard collective agreement defines the responsibilities of the employer and 
trade union organizations to ensure and monitor occupational safety 
and health (OSH) measures and performance. It lists the areas of involvement for occupational safety representatives, members of OSH commissions (committees) and representatives of the relevant elected bodies of the primary trade union organizations in relation 
to the steps needed to create safe working conditions, and prevent 
occupational injuries and diseases. The standard contract regulates the balance between the interests of the employer and employees in the event of a Company reorganization or reduction in the workforce 
and staff cuts. It also specifies the minimum notice time
28, prior to the 
start of relevant activities, for notifying the respective employment 
agencies and the elected primary trade union organization 
representative.The Company’s trade union organizations actively engage with 
young employees. Trade union committees involve young people in addressing issues related to improving working conditions, 
housing, and public services and create committees to work with 
young employees. These committees participate in developing and implementing programs to help new, young employees to adapt to working life and prepare programs and proposals relating to the 
interests of young employees, which are further taken into account 
when the relevant sections of the enterprises’ collective agreements are drafted. The committees also organize youth leisure activities and carry out cultural, sports and recreational health events.
The Company has a tradition of holding meetings for the heads of HR departments that are also attended by trade union leaders of the major Gazprom Neft subsidiaries. During August 27–29, 2012, this offsite meeting took place in Saint Petersburg. The participants discussed current issues in all areas of HR management, including the implementation of the Unified Social Benefit Systems, non-material 
incentives, the handling of ‘hot-line’ inquiries and the possibilities of specialist relocation within the Company. As part of the event, the trade 
union leaders met with V. V. Baranov, Gazprom Neft’s Deputy Chairman of the Management Board & Deputy CEO for Administrative Issues. They discussed the interaction of trade unions with employees and top managers of the enterprises and the promotion of new corporate HR approaches and standards in the regions.

 ●Developing results-oriented leadership and team leadership skills;
 ●Building commitment to seek opportunities for the Company and develop innovative business thinking.
In 2012, the Company completed the formation of technical competency profiles and establishing the test base for the Omsk refinery. The Company continues to improve its technical competence monitoring system, which allows the scheduling of technical training 
based on the results of employee testing.
The relocation of the Company’s office required collaboration 
with local employee training service providers; in 2012, six Saint Petersburg training companies were added to the list of corporate 
training providers. As part of the ‘SAPSAN’ project, the Company held 
30 team-building events that involved more than 770 employees.
The Company is expanding its cooperation with Saint Petersburg 
universities. It reached an agreement with the Saint Petersburg State 
University on the internship of its students at the Company and began to define the scope of cooperation with the Saint Petersburg State University of Economics.
Gazprom Neft actively uses new educational technologies. E-learning 
is becoming more and more popular. Using multimedia and Internet technologies allows knowledge to be acquired on-the-job under a personalized schedule. Moreover, the results achieved are often 
better than the results from traditional full-time study. A survey 
conducted by the Company showed that the majority of employees appreciate the advantages of this form of learning.
The Company has been employing the e-learning system since 2010. 
Today, it includes 23 courses. It covers employees of the Corporate 
Center and 22 subsidiaries. In 2012, the Company’s employees attended 881 courses. Recently, the corporate distance learning matrix was widened to include a specialized ‘HR for non-HR’ program. 
The program is intended for line managers and serves as a tool to 
support the improvement of personnel management skills.2012

Competencies Model is a document that represents the set of skills 
required by employees to achieve maximum success. This model is used to evaluate a potential candidate for a vacant position or an existing employee, or to determine priorities for generating training programs and personal development plans. Following the adoption of the Corporate Code, the competencies model was updated and supplemented with indicators for employee appraisal against additional management criteria based on the Company’s values. For examples, the managers’ competency profile now includes indicators on: support of initiatives from direct reports, individual initiatives to increase efficiency of processes (including those in adjacent departments and the Company as a whole) and initiatives to reduce bureaucracy. For ordinary employees, additional indicators included: the ability to share experience and knowledge with colleagues, the ability to predict the results of their own actions, teamwork skills, and initiative. The competencies model is available on the intranet portal and may be used for quick self-assessment.WHAT A COMPANY EMPLOYEE RECEIVES

CREATING A SUCCESSION POOL
The shortfall of employees in the oil and gas industry is recognised 
as an urgent problem, associated with specific industry conditions. Professionals are in short supply throughout the management 
hierarchy, as well as along the entire value chain: from production 
to refining and sales. A succession pool enables the Company to guarantee the supply of employees, improve their quality by planning the career of key employees and protecting the positions that are 
particularly important for the Company’s strategic development.
In addition to reducing the time it takes to fill key positions, the 
succession pool makes it possible to increase the proportion of in-house appointments: internal candidates not only possess proven 
professional skills, but also are also well aware of the Company’ s 
characteristics and share its values. Moreover, participation in the 
succession pool opens up new employee opportunities as well: the Company provides individual development and professional skills 
improvement programs. The Company is implementing the ‘Unified 
Succession Pool’ project that enables it to manage the succession pool across the entire Company based on common principles and rules.In 2012 the first graduation from the ‘Project Academy’, created jointly with the Moscow School of Management SKOLKOVO, took place.
Gazprom Neft is building up its business, expanding its 
operating geography, and increasing its operational and organizational efficiency. Specific large-scale projects are at the heart of this work. Therefore, project management 
experts are in particularly high demand at the Company. 
During the year, 35 participants on the program studied the theory of managing large projects and relevant Gazprom Neft experience, modelled business processes, undertook an internship, and designed their own projects under the expert 
guidance of 15 of Gazprom Neft’s top managers. This work 
was aimed to ensure that the participants acquired a unified vision and a structured approach to addressing the current challenges of large-scale project management.
The creation and development of a high-quality 
succession pool is one of the priorities of the Company’s HR department.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP

SAFE DEVELOPMENT:  
ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH & SAFETY
POLICY & MANAGEMENT
The Company sees effective management 
of occupational risks that may potentially have an impact on employee life and health, equipment, property and the environment to be a key priority in the area of corporate social responsibility. The Company constantly strives to improve in the field of industrial and occupational safety. The basic principle of Gazprom Neft’s corporate policy in the area of industrial safety, labour, and environmental protection is ‘No economic, technical or other considerations shall be taken into account at the expense of the safety of workers, the general public or the environment’.The Company strives to continuously improve its HSE performance. 
Gazprom Neft’s corporate policy on Industrial Safety, Labour, and Environmental Protection establishes the following targets for all its 
subsidiaries and units:
 ●consistently reduce rates of industrial accidents, work-related 
illnesses and adverse environmental impacts;
 ●ensure the safety of production operations and environmental protection by introducing an integrated industrial, occupational and environmental safety management system at Gazprom 
Neft production facilities. This system meets global standards 
and incorporates key processes of hazard identification and the assessment and management of occupational risks;
 ●consistently implement global best practice in the field of engineering, technology and the management of industrial, occupational and environmental safety at all Gazprom Neft 
production facilities.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP
2012 SuSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 76
 The Company’s commitments regarding industrial and environmental 
safety, labor, and civil protection include:
 ●Creating conditions for HSE activities, including methods of motivation and engagement, so that each Gazprom Neft employee is aware of and responsible for his/her own safety and the safety of others and has the right to stop and/or refuse to perform any activity if it poses a threat to the life or health of the employee or others;
 ●Introduction, support and continuous improvement of efficient HSE management systems at the Company in compliance with international and national standards;
 ●Consistent implementation of comprehensive preventative measures to reduce the likelihood of accidents to a reasonable practicable level, based on the understanding that any planned or 
current business operation of Gazprom Neft or its subsidiaries or 
affiliates involves potential hazards;
 ●Continuous improvement of working conditions, industrial and environmental safety, and monitoring of such improvements;
 ●Complying with applicable legal requirements and using all available economically feasible possibilities to mitigate risks beyond the scope of legal requirements;
 ●Ongoing efforts to increase employees’ level of knowledge, competence and awareness with regard to health, safety and the environment using different types of training and mentoring;
 ●Provision of the resources necessary for the implementation of the HSE Policy;
 ●Implementation of relevant management methods with respect to Gazprom Neft’s counterparties and business partners to enforce compliance with the Policy requirements when such parties are 
engaged in operations at Gazprom Neft’s enterprises and facilities;
 ●Transparency of, and easy access to, HSE figures through 
appropriate exchange of information and dialog with all stakeholders;
 ●Timely updates and communication of corporate HSE Policies to all Gazprom Neft Group employees and third-party stakeholders.MAIN COMPANY OBJECTIVES IN INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY, HEALTH AND CIVIL PROTECTION FOR 2012–2013
 ●Further development of the integrated industrial and environmental safety, health and civil protection system;
 ●Reduction in employee injury rates;
 ●Systematic and effective reduction of adverse environmental impact caused by operations.
Activities in this area are integrated into the Company’s system of business planning: the main aspects of HSE activities are reflected in the business plans for exploration and production enterprises 
and the logistics, refining and marketing block for 2013–2015, as 
well as in the functional business plan of the Occupational Safety Department for 2013.
The Company’s HSE work conforms to its corporate Policy on 
Industrial and Environmental Safety, Health and Civil Protection and is coordinated at the Corporate Centre by the Occupational Safety Department. The Department has sub-divisions that specialize in industrial and fire safety, occupational safety and 
health, and environmental issues. The Special Programs sub-
division deals with civil defence and emergency management. The Department reports directly to Gazprom Neft’s CEO. Respective HSE functions in all of Gazprom Neft’s subsidiaries and affiliates 
also report directly to their top management. This organizational 
scheme demonstrates the importance that the Company places on this area and provides an organizational and structural platform for improving HSE risk management. The Company has a collective body, the Industrial Safety, Occupational Health, and 
Environmental Protection Council, which facilitates the discussion 
of the most important occupational safety issues, formulation of new strategic objectives and adjusting of current objectives. The Council is composed of the managers of functional sub-divisions 
of the Occupational Safety Department and managers responsible 
for HSE at the Company’s major assets.
In 2012, scheduled work continued towards establishing an HSE 
and social protection system. An analysis of system efficiency and 
adjustments to the system as part of ongoing efforts to improve it 
were the main objectives towards this goal during the reporting year.
In 2011, the Company developed and successfully applied an 
integrated HSE and social protection indicator based on accident 
and injury rates, as well as measures of progress in implementing fire safety, transportation and environmental programs by subsidiaries 
and affiliates. Progress in implementing the HSE and social protection 
program is monitored on a quarterly basis.
In 2012, the practice of auditing HSE and social protection 
management systems at subsidiaries gained momentum as two audit 
checks of the HSE and social protection system were conducted. Gazprom Neft’s Policy in HSE has been communicated to all 
employees. The text of the Policy is available on the corporate portal, in the library of Company documents, on the Company’s 
official website, and is posted at workplaces.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP
2012 SuSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 77
 Five enhanced technical audits aimed at assessing legal compliance 
were conducted along with an analysis of employee competence. This identified issues in the funding and implementation of programs to bring pre-existing facilities into compliance with the latest standards and regulations, to meet contemporary requirements and programs for replacing obsolete equipment, and to improve 
operational efficiency and reduce costs. Enhanced technical audits 
were conducted by corporate experts at three of the Company’s refineries (Gazpromneft-Omsk refinery, Gazpromneft-Moscow refinery, Slavneft-YaNOS) and by external auditors at the Gazpromneft-Ural 
and Gazpromneft-Shipping facilities.
The monitoring of supplier and contractor compliance with Gazprom 
Neft’s policy on industrial and environmental safety and social 
protection (HSE and social protection) is considered to be an important part of the Company’s corporate responsibility.
The Company has adopted the standard ‘Procedure for managing 
contractors and cooperative arrangements in the field of industrial, 
environmental and occupational safety, and social protection.’ In addition to a contract, all contractors who provide services to the company sign an Agreement on HSE and social protection that 
stipulates mandatory compliance with legal requirements and 
company standards for HSE and social protection.
If a contractor violates safety requirements, penal sanctions up 
to and including termination of the contract are imposed. Prior to 
commencing work, all contractors undertake an induction briefing. The 
Company has established a process of unplanned briefings following accident investigations and communicating accidents by means of news bulletins. At the end of the contract, the customer (Gazprom 
Neft) conducts a comprehensive assessment of the contractor’s 
occupational safety performance, which allows it to rank contractors and use the results for future selection purposes. This rationale was also behind the introduction in 2011 of the Azimut IT control system for contractor accident accounting.Regular training is an important component of continuous improvement in HSE and social protection. In 2012, the Company organized and carried out four online courses for the exploration and production enterprises: ‘Investigation and Reporting’, ‘Occupational Safety and Personal Protective Equipment’, ‘HSE System’, and ‘Road Safety’. Leadership training in the field of industrial safety 
and health was organized for the heads of the exploration and 
production enterprises. Corporate training in HSE standards continued. Training matrices are updated and adjusted annually according to the needs and risks involved, based on investigation 
and production control results.
Gazprom Neft has developed a practice of regularly exchanging 
HSE experience both within the Company and with external 
organizations. In 2012, the Company held another conference on occupational safety (such conferences have taken place since 2010). It was attended by over 150 participants from the Corporate Centre, the Company’s subsidiaries, government bodies, and 
suppliers of materials and equipment. A conference on fire safety 
also took place, which brought together more than 50 Company representatives and fire departments that provide fire protection services to its subsidiaries. Similar meetings were held at the 
subsidiaries and affiliates.

HEALTH & SAFETY
Whilst this performance is encouraging, the Company remains 
focused on continuous improvement in this area.  In particular the reduction in the number of accidents and further reduction in 
the injury rate remain important objectives. Regular follow-ups 
of corrective actions, based on accident investigation, production control and audits, were carried out. In 2012, each case was followed by investigation, reasons were identified, corrective 
actions were proposed and implemented, and follow-up of their 
implementation was duly organized.
The Company will expand occupational safety and health training 
programs so that each employee is responsible and actively involved 
in ensuring his/her own safety and the safety of others.
Occupational safety and health of employees is an area of 
mutual responsibility and of constructive interaction between the 
Company management and the trade unions. Mutual commitment 
in this area is reflected in collective agreements and programs that aim to improve the health of employees.
 In 2012, initiatives to improve industrial safety resulted in a reduction in the lost time injury frequency rate of 1.2%. The number of traffic accidents decreased by 11.3% (125 accidents 
in 2012 versus 141 accidents in 2011), and the road accident 
rate decreased by 18.7%
29. The number of fires was reduced by 
35% (22 cases in 2012 versus 34 in 2011). The transparency of accident reporting improved, including the registration of minor 
accidents.
29 The road accident rate is defined as the number of road accidents / total kilometers travelled х 
1,000,000.Analysis shows that the Company’s main 
occupational safety risks are associated with road traffic accidents, failure to comply with rules for hazardous tasks, employee falls, and violation of the law and security rules by contractors. In 2012, the Company developed and implemented programs to prevent injuries and improve road and fire safety at all its subsidiaries and affiliates. GAZPROM NEFT GROuP

A significant increase in payments for discharging pollutants into the 
open air has resulted from the additional multipliers now in effect following the Decree of the Russian Government No. 7 dated January 8, 2009, on Measures to Stimulate the Reduction of Air Pollution from 
Associated Gas Flaring Products.
The increase in fees for waste disposal is due to increased amounts 
of slurry formed during pit-free drilling at the OJSC Slavneft- 
Megionneftegaz, as well as increased volumes of waste produced by 
petroleum product suppliers due to the consolidation of the assets of OJSC MTK and LLC Mosnefteprodukt with those of LLC Gazprom Neft - Center and the acquisition of assets from OJSC Gazprom Neft -Nizhny Novgorod. This has required payments to be made with anincreased multiplier due to the expiry of environmental permits for a number of facilities incorporated into the newly purchased assets.
Improving Air Quality
In 2012, the Company took a set of measures to protect the atmosphere. In accordance with the requirements of environmental protection legislation, provisions have been made to draft standards 
for maximum permissible emissions (MPE) of air pollutants, and 
documents are being prepared to obtain permits for emissions, along with developing projects to arrange sanitary protection zones (SPZ). The Company’s subsidiaries have established annual environmental 
monitoring programs and have made provisions for laboratory control 
over the quality of air at sources of polluting emissions and along SPZ boundaries. 
Fixed asset maintenance and repairs of AGMSs
30, pumping 
equipment, gas pipelines, oil-gas separators, vertical steel tanks, 
flares, and furnaces have contributed to a reduction in air pollution 
risks. The Company monitors the compliance of its business units 
with relevant operational practices. 
Provisions have been made for conducting control and adjustment 
operations associated with motor vehicle exhaust fumes (such as 
toxicity). The equipment used for this analysis – gas analysers and smoke meters – was calibrated within the specified time limits at the state supervision agencies.
Projects related to capital construction, reconstruction and repairs 
of fixed assets have all had a positive impact. Specific projects which have had a positive environmental impact include: the construction of associated gas capture and recycling facilities at 
LLC Gazprom Neft-East, the installation of pontoon equipment at 
OJSC Slavneft-YaNOS and LLC Gazprom Neft-Omsk Refinery tank farms, the conversion of diesel fuel hydrotreaters over to water blocks equipped with closed oil separators at the OJSC Gazprom Neft-Omsk Refinery, the construction of modern mechanical 
treatment facilities while simultaneously decommissioning obsolete 
treatment facilities at OJSC Gazprom Neft-Moscow Refinery, and the installation of filters on air valves of the tank battery at LLC Gazprom Neft-Center.
Overall atmospheric pollutant emissions from the exploration and 
production segment (EPS) increased year-on-year in 2012. This was due to an increase in oil production and changes in the accounting methodology for emissions of air pollutants from associated gas 
flaring products. EPS facilities carry out regular projects designed to 
reduce emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. These include 
30 AGMS – automated group metering station.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP

GAZPROM NEFT-MOSCOW REFINERY’S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM UP TO 2020
In 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors approved Gazprom 
Neft-Moscow Refinery’s Development Program to 2020. Total planned investment amounts to 165 billion rubles. Environmental 
safety is a main focus of the Program, which is aimed at 
increasing production efficiency and product quality significantly. Planned actions, such as the dismantling of decommissioned treatment facilities in 2013–2014 and the reclamation of 
vacated territories due to the introduction of modern mechanical 
treatment facilities, the upgrading of the sulphur production unit, and the equipping of the tank farm with floating roof equipment will have a significant positive environmental effect in 2013–2015.
The reconstruction of the sulphur production unit will increase 
the sulphur conversion rate, thereby significantly reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide (by more than 10 times) and hydrogen sulphide (by more than 70 times). The first phase 
of the project (which covers the configuration of facilities 
for shipping degassed sulphur and the reconstruction of the liquid sulphur loading rack) was implemented in 2012. The second phase (which covers the construction of tail gas treatment unit and facilities for shipping granulated sulphur) is scheduled for completion in 2014. This project 
will reduce existing carbon emissions by more than 80%. 
Equipping tank farms with floating roof equipment will reduce carbon emissions in 2015 by 98%. Since 2011, Gazprom Neft-Moscow Refinery has been working to introduce an 
automated emission monitoring system (AEMS) at the main 
controlled emission sources (eight process exhaust stacks) as part of the integrated environmental safety program. AEMS measurement data will be sent to the data room of the Unified State Environmental Monitoring System in 
Moscow which is operated by the public environmental agency 
Mosekomonitoring. As part of this work in 2012, the assembly of the AEMS on the first four sources of emissions was performed. Before 2013, AEMS is planned to be implemented 
at the diesel fuel hydro-treatment units (LCh-24-2000), 
catalytic cracking units (G-43-107), and sulphur and bitumen production units.
the implementation of associated gas utilization programs, routing repairs and overhauls of fixed assets, including pumping equipment, gas pipelines, tanks, flares and stoves, as well as laboratory measurements of pollutant emissions from stationary sources of air 
pollution, etc.
Specific emissions have been reduced at oil refineries. Air protection 
measures have reduced overall pollutant emissions into the air, despite the increasing volume of crude oil being refined.
Water management
A set of scientific, organizational and technical measures conducted as part of annual environmental safety programs contributed to reductions in water pollution risks.
In 2012, research was conducted which helped to determine the 
permissible residual oil content in soils near where water resources are utilized, as well as the maximum permissible level of crude oil 
and petroleum products in bottom sediments of surface waters. The 
classification of soils specific to water conservation districts of the taiga zone, Western Siberia, drafted in the course of the research, will improve the quality of water conservation and restoration projects at the Company’s EPS facilities in the future.One of the research projects carried out in 2012 covers the development of aerobic and anaerobic bioremediation process for oil-contaminated marshes in Western Siberia. The issue is important for remediation and restoration work in this region which has complex 
climatic and hydrological conditions.

The Company routinely performs laboratory and instrumental 
monitoring of surface water, groundwater and wastewater, and also assesses surface water bottom sediments. EPS facilities have 
conducted destructive testing and pipeline monitoring at water 
crossings. The Company has arranged for underwater surveys of the areas. Zones have been determined for maintaining water quality in areas of water usage, and laboratory monitoring of 
groundwater quality has been arranged along with maintenance 
and repairs. The increase in the volume of wastewater ground disposal in 2012 was due to the additional disposal of bottom water at the Severo-Pokurskoye field, OJSC Slafneft-Megionneftegaz. The increased volume of regulatory treated 
wastewater disposal into the surface water facility of OJSC 
Slavneft-YaNOS was due to increases in both the crude oil refining volumes and in the amount of precipitation (according to the Yaroslavl Center for Hydrometeorology and Environmental 
Monitoring, the amount of precipitation in 2012 exceeded 2011 
levels by 39%).
Land use and soil reclamation
The conservation of the natural ecological system, natural landscapes and complexes is one of Gazprom Neft’s priorities. In 2012, the Company took measures to conserve and restore land resources, 
taking into account the climate, water, soil and vegetation conditions 
in the areas of its operations. 
The EPS has compiled an inventory of affected, oil-contaminated 
lands and sludge storage. Reclamation projects based on the results 
of this inventory are now under development. They are continuously monitored and assessed in terms of their efficiency. License areas are cleared from unauthorized landfills and scrap metal. 
To prevent pipeline ruptures, inhibitory corrosion protection is 
provided for pipelines. The Company monitors the corrosion rate of pipelines and inspects their condition. The end-to-end servicing and management of industrial oil-waste landfills is provided, with 
laboratory research conducted at the landfills.In 2012, the Moscow Refinery constructed a modern 
mechanical treatment plant and decommissioned obsolete facilities at the old treatment plant. This will reduce the 
emissions of pollutants from sewage treatment plants by 
96%, and increase the quality of treatment of industrial waste water.

 A set of scientific, organizational and technical measures conducted 
as part of annual environmental safety programs contributes to reductions in water pollution risks.
In 2012, the Company undertook research to develop an aerobic-
and-anaerobic bioremediation technology for industrial land contaminated at a deep level. Due to sorption, soils in production 
areas can hold significant amounts of hydrocarbons after 
remediation using existing methods, which means that a secondary contamination of groundwater is possible. The bioremediation of this residual contamination based on the aerobic-and-anaerobic bioremediation technology may become an alternative to existing 
methods. This system would reduce the time and financial cost of 
reclamation, while increasing its quality.
During this research project, reactors were designed, chemicals 
selected and their conditions of use defined to simulate anaerobic-
and-aerobic bioremediation technology in laboratory conditions. In future, it is planned to carry out field-testing in the Company’s operating regions.238.28

 Waste Management
In 2012, waste management operations focused on addressing 
problems such as regulatory compliance, mitigation of environmental impacts and economic costs. Work was also carried out to strengthen 
the bunding of multiple well platforms, tank farms, fuel and lubricant 
depots, and liquid chemicals storage facilities, install drainage tanks at multiple well platforms, prepare for the quarrying of peat and peat transfer to sludge collectors and upgrade sludge collectors and solid 
waste landfills. As a result of these activities, the amount of reclaimed 
sludge storage has exceeded targets by 12%, with large volumes of oily waste treated in accordance with the approved plan.
Other initiatives in 2012 included Gazprom Neft-Khantos’ transition 
to pitless drilling which enables sludge to be processed into secondary 
raw materials for further use at the enterprise.
Engagement with state, expert & public 
organizations for environmental protection
Gazprom Neft has been actively involved in the process of improving 
environmental legislation and a package of existing legal instruments in this area. The Company’s experts have participated in expert 
reviews and made proposals on a number of legislative drafts, 
including:
 ●‘On the Protection of the Marine Environment Against Pollution by Oil During the Development of Hydrocarbon Deposits on the Continental Shelf and at the Internal Sea Waters and Territorial Sea 
of the Russian Federation’;
 ●‘On Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian 
Federation in Terms of Improving Standardization in the Field of Environmental Protection and the Introduction of Economic 
Incentives for Businesses to Introduce the Best Technology’;
 ●‘On Amendments to the Federal Law ‘On Production and 
Consumption Waste’ and Other Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation as Regards the Economic Incentives in Waste 
Management’.
At the same time, certain environmental legislation issues remain 
outstanding and this fact materially affects the operation of 
enterprises in the industry. An example is Resolution № 7 of the 
Government dated January 8, 2009, which sets a target for APG flaring and has been effective since January 1, 2012. It establishes the basis for the new procedure of calculating fees for pollutant The Omsk Refinery took part in the ‘Clean Air’ environmental campaign which was held from June 1 to July 6 2012  in Omsk. The event, which brought together industrialists, 
ecology scientists, government supervisors, members 
of non-governmental associations and experts from Omsk universities, aimed to ensure the enforcement of environmental legislation regarding atmospheric conditions 
and its impact on public health. During the ‘Clean Air’ 
campaigns, environmentalists check Omsk fuel and gas filling stations for compliance with Technical Regulations, national standards and specifications. Samples of light petroleum products and liquefied gas are tested at the accredited 
technical control laboratory of Gazprom Neft-Omsk Refinery, 
the only laboratory accredited to the appropriate standard in the region. The laboratory specialists of the Omsk Refinery analyzed over 100 samples of light petroleum products and 
liquefied gas. The ‘Clean Air’ action has been held in Omsk for 
over 20 years. During this time, the Omsk laboratory of the Omsk Refinery has examined the quality of fuel sold at Omsk filling stations. All tests are performed free of charge.
emissions from AOG flaring. However, the methodology for applying additional coefficients to the standard exhaust emission 
fees has not been defined.
The Company is actively involved in projects, in collaboration with 
municipal authorities, to preserve natural resources and unique 
ecosystems in its operating regions. For example, it organized the 
compilation of an ecological passport for the Yamal region, jointly with the Department of Natural Resources Regulation, in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area. GAZPROM NEFT GROuP
2012 SuSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 89
In addition, within the framework of the Cooperation Agreement, the 
Company and the Government of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area – Yugra agreed environmental actions with the following objectives:
 ●Rational use of associated gas;
 ●Prevention and clean-up of oil spills;
 ●Reclamation of contaminated land;
 ●Assessment of the impact of projected activities on the environment;
 ●Informing the government of the Autonomous Area about the results of industrial environmental control.
In order to comply with state environmental policy and key aspects of the state system of environmental standardization, Company representatives participated in several conferences and forums, including:
 ●II Congress of Russian Ecologists (Moscow);
 ●III International Forum ‘Saint Petersburg – the Sea Capital of Russia. Ecology’ (Saint Petersburg);
 ●Forum ‘New Technologies in Waste Oil Processing & Reclamation of Contaminated Land’ (Moscow).
When addressing environmental problems, Gazprom Neft actively cooperates with expert and non-governmental (public) organizations. In 2012, together with the Regional Public Organization Marine Mammals Council and with the assistance of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Russia, the Company continued joint research in the regions of the Barents Sea. Earlier studies have identified species in these regions that are particularly valuable to the ecosystem. The analysis confirmed that the most vulnerable marine mammal in the south-eastern part of the Barents Sea and adjacent areas of the White and Kara seas is the Atlantic walrus. The objectives for the conservation of this species will be considered in the plans for economic development 
of the waters and shelf of the Barents Sea. In 2012, research 
was conducted to identify the necessary measures needed for an anthropogenic pollution monitoring system in the key habitats of endangered marine mammals.
Gazprom Neft is involved in international discussions on environmental 
issues. So, at the end of April 2012, as part of the Third International 
Environmental Conference, organized by Gazprom Neft and held at 
the NIS office center in Novi Sad (Serbia), experts from Russia, Serbia and the European Union discussed the issue of industrial waste disposal, which is vital for most major industrial companies. The event held at the NIS office centre in Novi Sad (Serbia) was attended by 
representatives of a number of international companies engaged in 
minimizing the industrial impact on the environment around the world, including Ludan Environmental Technologies SRL (Romania), Argus Limited (USA), FUGRO Group (Netherlands), Veolia Water Solutions 
& Technologies (France), and YUNIRISK (Serbia). The discussion was 
aimed at sharing experiences and finding effective ways to eliminate existing pollution and prevent further occurrences. The conference participants were introduced to the practices used by Gazprom Neft’s specialists and the developments and technologies used in the 
European companies represented at the conference.Gazprom Neft-Khantos was recognized as one of the best 
Russian organizations for ecology and was awarded a gold medal and certificate at the ‘100 Best Russian Companies: 
Ecology and Environmental Management’ competition held 
at a ceremony in Saint Petersburg. The General Director of Gazprom Neft-Khantos, Sergei Doktor, received the ‘Environmentalist of the Year 2012’ badge of honour and 
a certificate signed by the members of the organizing 
committee, which was composed of representatives of the Federation Council and the State Duma of the Russian Federation. The main criteria used for this award included the application of a consistent environmental management 
system and environmental performance in 2012.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP

ENERGY CONSUMPTION & ENERGY EFFICIENCY
The Company’s divisions are developing and implementing measures 
to reduce energy consumption, and introducing energy efficiency plans.
An active energy-saving policy is a strategic priority for the 
Exploration and Production division. As part of medium-term energy efficiency plans, energy-saving measures are intended to reduce the 
energy-related component in the overall unit production costs incur red 
by EPS facilities.
Key energy-saving measures in the exploration and production 
enterprises:
 ●Use of energy-efficient electric centrifugal pumps;
 ●Introduction of valve electric motors;
 ●Decommissioning of electric centrifugal pumps operating in the left margin of the operating range prior to failure in order to save energy;
 ●Optimization of downhole equipment configuration;
 ●Optimization of downhole equipment and pumps operation at the booster pump stations.
The main indicator of energy efficiency – the specific energy consumption (SEC) for the extraction of liquid – declined by 1.3% (from 25.02 kWh/t to 24.70 kWh/t) at Gazpromneft-Noyabrskneftegaz in 2012, by 1.9% (from 43.7 kWh/t to 42.88 kWh/t) at Gazpromneft-Khantos, 
and by 2.6% (from 34.46 kWh/t to 33.58 kWh/t) at Gazpromneft-East 
compared with 2011. In 2012, measures were introduced to reduce energy consumption; these saved 145 million kWh at EPS facilities, including 39 million kWh at Gazpromneft-Noyabrskneftegaz, 76 million kWh at Gazpromneft-Muravlenko, 23 million kWh at Gazpromneft-
Khantos, and 6 million kWh at Gazpromneft-East.Currently, the Company’s EPS facilities are focusing on establishing a 
regular, permanent system of energy saving – an energy management system that complies with the ISO 50001:2011 standard. The energy 
management system is based on the introduction of technical and 
system measures and mechanisms for monitoring, auditing, analysing and taking corrective actions. This will enable a shift from individual technical measures to systemic solutions both in technology and management.
To reduce emergency power curtailments and subsequent oil losses, 
the Company has developed a program to improve reliability and upgrade equipment and grids at Gazprom Neft production subsidiaries 
and affiliates for 2013 to 2015. In addition to technical measures, the 
program will include research on the current reliability of grids and electrical equipment, ranking and assessing damage risks, including those resulting from excessive climatic loads.
The main areas of the program are:
 ●Measures to strengthen thunderstorm and lightning protection of 
grids and power engineering facilities;
 ●Measures to upgrade (retrofitting electrical installations) grids and substations;
 ●Power grid and equipment overhauls;
 ●Re-engineering of power facilities.
In 2012, in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 2611, 
energy audits were conducted at all subsidiaries and affiliates of the 
EPS. Based on the audit results, a set of energy-saving measures has been developed, along with the receipt of energy certificates. The measures are scheduled for implementation in 2013 and 2014.
The energy efficiency plan for Gazprom Neft’s logistics, refinement 
and sales segment for 2013 to 2015 aims to reduce the consumption of heat and electricity by 9,926.3 TJ (including 6,440.3 TJ at the Omsk refinery, 992.1 TJ at the Moscow refinery, and 2,493.9 TJ at YaNOS, 
which make up almost 5% of the designed consumption of electricity 
and heat during this period.
Main Areas of Energy Saving in Logistics, Refining and 
Marketing Subsidiaries & Affiliates:
 ●Introducing variable-frequency drives in electric motors (Omsk 
refinery, Moscow refinery, YaNOS);
 ●Modernizing compressor equipment: implementing step control, installing an anti-surge system; reconstructing instrumentation and controls for the air drying system (Omsk refinery);Enhancing energy efficiency and optimizing the use of energy resources are deemed urgent tasks for oil companies: energy costs make up a significant portion of operating costs. Through 
implementing energy conservation measures by oil producers, 
the Company successfully saved RUB 804 million.

 ●Reconstructing lighting systems using energy-saving technologies 
(Moscow refinery, Omsk refinery, YaNOS);
 ●Increasing in-house steam production through waste heat recovery from process furnaces and streams (YaNOS, Omsk refinery);
 ●Enhancing fuel efficiency in process furnaces: ceramic heating surfaces; hyperfine thermal insulation of furnaces; burner modernization, replacing tent stoves (with an efficiency coefficient 
of 63% to 70%) with vertical cylindrical furnaces (with an efficiency 
coefficient of 90%) at the Omsk refinery, Moscow refinery, and YaNOS.
In 2012, the LRSS-oriented corporate project ‘Enhancing the Efficiency of Energy-Saving Process Management at Oil Refining Facilities of OJSC Gazprom Neft (the energy management system – EMS)’ was launched as per the ISO 50001 standard. A unified methodological framework for implementing the energy management 
system at Gazprom Neft’s oil refineries was developed, including the 
‘Energy Efficiency Technical Policy’, the basic standard for the ‘LRSS-oriented Energy Management System’, methodological documents on drafting the ‘Program for Energy Saving and Enhanced Energy 
Efficiency’ and monitoring the impact of implementing energy-saving 
measures. In 2013, the Company plans to introduce the energy management system at pilot facilities – OJSC Gazpromneft-Omsk Refinery.Major energy-saving measures in 2012 were:
 ●reconstruction of economizers and superheaters for recovery boilers (with an energy-saving impact of 546.6 TJ);
 ●installation of digital excitation controllers at compressor motors (with an energy-saving impact of 100.1 TJ);
 ●hyperfine thermal insulation of furnaces (with an energy-saving impact of 151.7 TJ).CONSUMPTION OF PURCHASED ENERGY: EXPLORATION &

REGIONAL POLICY & LOCAL 
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
Gazprom Neft shapes its portfolio of regional social projects 
through dialog with governments, local communities, and the Company workforce representatives
32. In 2012, an enlarged 
meeting of the Management Board adopted the ‘Home Towns’ program, refining the Company’s approach to social investment in 
the regions where it operates as part of implementing the concept 
of regional policy, which was approved by the Management Board in December 2010. The ‘Home Towns’ program aims at further developing tools to involve both local communities and the Company’s employees in the process of shaping the portfolio of projects, and in directly implementing social programs.
Gazprom Neft views its social investments as a contribution to 
the growth of high-quality human capital, the development of the socio-economic and cultural potential of the operating regions of 
its subsidiaries and affiliates and, therefore, as a key factor in the 
effective implementation of the corporate strategy.In the regions where it operates, Gazprom Neft 
acts as a major social investor and a partner of local authorities in addressing the most pressing local problems of social development.
32 For detailed information on the dialog with local communities, see the SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT & STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT Section of this Report.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP
2012 SuSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 95
The most significant projects within the 
‘Home Towns’ social investment program are implemented by the Company under agreements on social and economic cooperation with regional and municipal authorities. 
34 agreements were signed in 2012: six of them were signed with the 
governments of Russian Federation constituent entities (Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area – Yugra and the 
Omsk, Orenburg, Vologda, and Kemerovo Regions); another 28 with the 
administration of municipalities where the Company’s major production units are situated.
The main parts of the ‘Home Towns’ program are:
 ●Urban development (housing, urban land improvement);
 ●Creating infrastructure for children and grassroots sports; ●Support and development of education and health-related 
initiatives and activities;
 ●Conservation of national and cultural traditions of the indigenous peoples of Northern Russia.
Social projects co-financed by the Company complied with the following principles:
 ●Relevance of the project to the local community;
 ●High potential for improving the quality of life in local communities;
 ●Compliance with the best practices of social management
In 2012, Gazprom Neft’s total costs associated with implementing the ‘Home Towns’ program amounted to RUB 2,399 million, of which RUB 2,052 million were spent on social 
investment as part of social and economic agreements with 
the regions and RUB 347 million on supporting charitable initiatives.GAZPROM NEFT & RUSSIAN REGIONS: STRATEGIC SOCIAL 
PARTNERSHIPGAZPROM NEFT GROuP
2012 SuSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 96
DEVELOPMENT OF THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT
Improving the urban environment is one of 
Gazprom Neft’s traditional areas for social investments. The company collaborates along these lines with municipal authorities based on the belief that small town residents should have the same access to a high-quality urban environment as residents of large cities do. 
A high-quality urban environment improves the sustainable 
development of local communities and the attractiveness of small towns as places to live.  Consequently, this has a positive effect on the  
growth of human capital and socio-economic development in these areas.
Construction and upgrades of housing, as well as helping to improve 
the urban environment constitute one of the specific segments of 
the social investment program. For example, in 2012, the Company financed the construction of a modern apartment complex with 120 apartments in the town of Muravlenko (YANAD), and renovated houses in the villages of the Nizhnevartovsk Region (KhMAD-Yugra). By the 
end of 2015, a new 120-apartment residential complex, also funded 
by Gazprom Neft, will be built in Khanty-Mansiysk. 
The lack of social housing, particularly in the remote centres of 
Gazprom Neft’s operating regions, is one of the reasons for the 
lack of qualified personnel in the social sector education, health and culture. The Company is involved in housing construction, as well as in financing the purchase of apartments for social workers. During the reporting period, Gazprom Neft bought five apartments in the 
Uvat district, Tyumen Region, and financed the construction of a 
27-apartment house for young professionals in the village of Parabel (Tomsk Region).For a number of years, the Company has been providing regular assistance to small municipalities, urban communities and rural settlements to retrofit their cultural centres. In 2012, it fitted out a Youth Centre in the town of Tarko-Sale (Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous 
Area).
In 2012, Gazprom Neft constructed a new office building in 
Khanty-Mansiysk. The eight-story building was built using the 
latest construction and architectural technology. The total living 
space exceeds 2.2 thousand m
2, and the the total area exceeds 
12 thousand m2. All rooms are fitted with modern equipment. 
Underground and overground parking provides space for 86 cars. The project was implemented within a record  time of 25 months. 
The construction cost was about average for the region, while the 
level of the architectural and design concepts was the highest. This ultra-modern building was quickly recognised as one of the town’ s 
architectural landmarks. This is not the Company’s first successful 
architectural success in Khanty-Mansiysk: in 2010, Gazprom Neft 
constructed one of the most avant-garde buildings in Siberia – the building of Ugra Chess Academy, which was the winner of ‘The Best Building’ at an international competition for professional architects.
In the reporting year, the Company actively participated in the 
development and modernization of housing and public utilities, as well as of local village roads in a number of regions. The Company funded the construction of sewage treatment plants in the settlements 
of Kyshik, Kedrovy, Vykatnoy and Kirpichny and Elizarovo village, 
and of the water supply network in the Kedrovy micro-district of Gornopravdinsk settlement Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area  Yugra.
The Company supports important cultural events in its operating 
regions. Since 2007, Gazprom Neft has been the general partner 
of the Annual International Film Festival ‘Spirit of Fire’, held in Khanty-Mansiysk.
The Oilfield Workers’ Campus adjacent to the Omsk Refinery (within the Sovetsky Administrative District), is a traditional residence for Company’s employees and holds a special importance within the 
Company’s program of social investment for regional development 
and local community support. In 2012, the Company helped finance a leisure room for retired people in the ‘Family House’ library, equipped children’s clubs ‘Globus’ and ‘Iskra’ and the Municipal Children & Youth Centre, and also funded local celebrations and festivals in the district. A special program was implemented to improve the area. 
It included landscape gardening, tree trimming, the installation of 
benches, lamps, architectural features, as well as equipping children’s playgrounds and an area for a farmers’ mini-market.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP
2012 SuSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 97
DEVELOPMENT OF CHILD & PUBLIC SPORTS INFRASTRUCTURE
The lack of up-to-date sports infrastructure 
is one of the most pressing problems in the regions. According to general statistics across the Russian Federation, sports halls with hard surfacing are accessible to 18% of the population, and only 5% can use swimming pools.
In 2012, Gazprom Neft completed the construction of the Zenith 
multipurpose sports complex (named after  Yuri Morozov) in the town of Noyabrsk (Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area), designed 
to accommodate 650 people. The building has a total area of 7.4 
thousand m
2 and houses a universal gym, a 25-meter swimming 
pool with six lanes, a children’s playroom, a workout facility and an 
aerobics room. On the ground floor there is a range of facilities 
for the treatment and rehabilitation of people with disabilities. Spectator stands in the gym can cater for 350 people and those in the swimming pool-hall for100 people. The universal gym can be 
transformed into a space for concerts, meetings and conferences. It 
is equipped with protective coating, additional seats, and sound and lighting equipment.The new complex is one of the many Zenith-branded facilities which are built by Gazprom Neft in its operating regions. Development of all Zenith sports complexes follows a single standard. This allows the 
right environment to be created for the active lifestyle of people of 
all ages, with different athletic backgrounds and health conditions, as well as for family sports. In addition, the sports complexes can be used for the towns’ cultural events. All facilities are open not only to employees of the Company, but also to the general public.
In 2012, the Company started the construction of multipurpose 
gyms under the Zenith brand in the Vyngapurovsky micro-district of Noyabrsk and in the Khanymey village (Yamalo-Nenets 
Autonomous Area).
Along with developing new infrastructure, the Company sponsors 
programs to modernize existing sports facilities. which are used by 
amateur sports teams and local residents. In the reporting year, the 
Company started to rebuild a fitness centre named after Pavel Sadyrin started as part of the ‘Home Towns’ program in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area.
GAZPROM NEFT GROuP
2012 SuSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 98
 The reconstruction includes the expansion of the playing ground 
to meet the standards for regional competitions, the building of a spectator area, and the construction of multi-purpose halls for boxing and wrestling. In addition, in 2012, the construction of a football and athletic stadium began in Noyabrsk (Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area) supported by the Company. In the town of Tara in the Omsk 
Region, the Company co-financed the construction of the ‘Olympus’ 
racetrack.
The Company places great importance on the creation of sport 
infrastructures for its own employees. During the year, the gym for 
employees working in the South licensed territory of the Priobskoye field (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area – Yugra) was refurbished and 
equipped with workout and exercise facilities.
One of the ways in which the Company supports grassroots sports 
and promotes active lifestyles among young people and family leisure activities is through its project to build all-weather open-air 
sports grounds. In summer, universal sports grounds with high-tech 
artificial surfacing can be used for playing football, basketball and volleyball, while in winter they are suitable for hockey. In 2012, seven such grounds were opened in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous 
Area (four in Noyabrsk and three in Muravlenko), and eight grounds 
opened in Omsk (two of them were built from scratch and the rest were reconstructed). Similar grounds will be opened in 2013 in the Orenburg Region and the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area.In support of children’s sports, in 2012 funds were allocated to teach teenagers from the ‘Rainbow’ children’s home in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area – Yugra to scuba dive in the swimming pool of the Yugra State University.
To support fitness and sports in the Omsk Region, Gazprom Neft 
sponsors the Avangard Sports Club non-commercial partnership. The 
comprehensive system of training hockey players starting at age six is a key feature of the Avangard Sports Club as a social project. The structure of the non-commercial partnership includes the ‘Avangard’ 
youth sports school, which involves more than 700 children. The 
regional chain of youth sport schools in the Omsk Region has ten branches. Between 1996 and 2012, the youth sport school teams 
were prize winners at Russian championships 13 times, and since 
2000, 14 pupils of the sport schools have become world champions as  
members of the Russian national team.
Alongside the construction and renovation of sports facilities, the 
Company actively supports sports events in the regions where 
it operates. The Company’s flagship social project in the field of children’s sports is actively developing: the Sixth International ‘Gazprom Neft Cup’ Tournament for Children KHL Teams was held 
in 2012, and attended by 16 teams. The tournament was organized 
in line with adult competition standards: matches were judged by KHL judges, the final match was broadcasted live on the Continental Hockey League television channel, and the games themselves were held on the ice arena of a professional club.
In 2012, as part of the ‘Gazprom to Children’ program, the Company launched a major inter-regional social project – ‘Avangard Hockey Academy’ – the goal of which is to establish a completely new 
contemporary system to train young players and develop hockey 
for children and youngsters. The project is being implemented under the aegis of Russia’s leading hockey club – Avangard Omsk, whose main foundations are the companies of the 
Gazprom Group. 
From 2013, this project will establish branches of the Academy in a number of Gazprom Neft’s operating regions. The branches will use a common methodology, standards, development system and ideology. The most talented trainees will be 
transferred from the branches to the Academy centre in Omsk for further training at the highest level. Hockey training will be 
organized as a pyramid of clubs: sport school – youth team – KHL team. Currently, among all KHL clubs, the Omsk ‘Avangard’ 
has the largest number of trainees, who are regularly capped 
by the Russian youth and main Russian national teams. During the reporting year, the Company started building the central complex for the Avangard Hockey Academy in the city of Omsk. 
Together with the two existing hockey centres of the Avangard 
hockey club, located in Omsk, the complex will form the Academy’s central infrastructure. The first Academy branches are planned to open in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area sports facilities, the construction of which was financed by 
Gazprom Neft.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP
2012 SuSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 99
EDUCATION & HEALTH
In 2012, the Company implemented a number 
of projects aimed at developing education. The lack of capacity in child day-care facilities and the poor quality of their equipment is one of the most acute problems of the regions. For example, according to the Education Committee of Khanty-Mansiysk, in January 2013, kindergartens were attended by 4,017 children aged 1.5 to 6 years, while the waiting list for a place in the Khanty-Mansiysk kindergartens numbered 5,899. On the one hand, this prevents a significant number of children from being engaged in the continuous learning system at the pre-school level, where the foundations of cognitive activity and social interaction are laid. On the other hand, this forces parents to extend their maternity leave, which causes involuntary disability and partial loss of skills. Finally, this reduces the attractiveness of towns which lack this social infrastructure as a place to live.
Gazprom Neft has helped a number of its operating regions to 
overcome this problem. During 2012, Gazprom Neft sponsored the construction of the ‘Planet Childhood’ day-care facilities in the city of 
Khanty-Mansiysk Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area - Yugra, designed 
for 200 children. This children’s day-care centre sets a new standard for pre-schools. It is carefully designed to allow children to experience the whole range of emotional and intellectual stimulus they need. 
The kindergarten infrastructure allows for all necessary physical 
development (swimming pool, room for active games and sports), cognitive ability development (multimedia complex, a laboratory for young naturalists and a climate museum) and emotional development (an equipped art studio and a winter garden). The kindergarten will be equipped with a video surveillance system, making it possible to overcome the physical distance between educational institutions and the family (traditionally, a considerable 
distance in this area). Once connected to the video system from 
home or from work, parents will be able to follow their children’ s 
educational process more actively. During the reporting period, the Company also financed the construction of a kindergarten in the village of Mezhdurechye (in the Omsk Region) and provided furniture 
for kindergartens in Omsk.
The Company invested significantly in the renovation and equipping of 
educational institutions in its operating regions. In particular, schools 
in the Tarsky District (Omsk region) were renovated at the Company’s 
expense. The Company helped to equip a number of Omsk schools with computer labs, chemical labs, school cafeterias and gyms. In the Tomsk Region, the Company funded the overhaul of a school in the village of Staroyugino in Kargasoksky District. The school renovation 
included: complete replacement of the foundation, partial replacement 
of the old timber walls, renovation of the heating, water and electricity systems, fitting out of rooms using modern materials and technology, and the complete renewal of furniture and appliances. In 
the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area – Yugra the Company contributed 
to the state program to improve security and energy efficiency of educational buildings and to provide them with innovative equipment.
Gazprom Neft places emphasis on the field of healthcare, especially 
on the quality of health services. The Company invests annually in the 
healthcare systems of the regions where it operates by sponsoring health facility renovations and purchasing medical equipment. During the reporting year, the Company purchased equipment for Children’ s 
Hospital No. 3, and paid for the repair of newborn rehabilitation rooms  
in Children’s Hospital No. 1 in Omsk. In the village of Yarki (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area – Yugra) Gazprom Neft participated in the construction of a medical and obstetric centre.GAZPROM NEFT GROuP

PRESERVATION & DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITY CULTURES
Gazprom Neft contributes to improving the 
quality of life for the indigenous peoples of 
the North – in KhMAD-Yugra and YANAD. The 
programs that the Company actively supports have been developed taking into account the 
cultural sensitivity of indigenous peoples of 
the North. They aim to integrate them into the modern economic and social landscape, 
while maintaining their cultural identity and 
traditional ways of life.In 2012, as is tradition, the Company helped communities in the 
Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area to buy snowmobiles, fuel and lubricants, construction materials, and diesel power generators and 
assisted in transporting children from camps to schools by helicopters. 
Gazprom Neft was actively involved in the construction of the local cultural centre in the Kutopyugan national settlement.
In 2012, the Company continued its financial support to construct 
an ethnic day-care camp for children of indigenous peoples in the Russkinskaya village (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area – Yugra) (the construction completion is scheduled for 2014).
As in previous years, Gazprom Neft supported traditional national 
festivals – for example, the Reindeer Herder Day which took place in the Halyasovey and Russkinskiye villages (Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area). The celebration included competitions: sledge jumping, throwing 
the Tynzyan (a lasso belt that is up to 30 meters long) onto a three-
meter driver’s pole, and reindeer sled racing. The Company awarded two Buran snowmobiles to the winners of the reindeer sled races.

YOUTH VOCATIONAL  
GUIDANCE
Jointly with the Saint Petersburg State Mining University, it organizes 
competitions for high school students in its operating regions. Based on their results, the students who demonstrated the best skills are 
automatically enrolled in the university. As part of these competitions 
the university lecturers give overview lectures for students of physics and chemistry.
Under the ‘Three Objectives’ program, Gazprom Neft’ introduced 
training (‘oil’ classes) for pupils in year 10 and 11 in schools in Omsk. At the end of these ‘oil’ classes, pupils can continue their education in professional colleges, and then return to their home towns to work at one of Gazprom Neft’s facilities.CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES & 
VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS
Corporate charitable projects are implemented using the Company’s own 
resources, as well as through the involvement of employees in charitable activities. Employees are involved in the implementation of charitable 
projects both in the form of fund-raising, and in the form of individual 
participation in a variety of volunteer programs.
Main charity programs:
 ●A program of targeted aid in response to public requests in the 
Company’s operating regions (charity support from the Company’s budget, based on the Charity Commission decisions);
 ●A mutual solidarity program: practical solutions to help employee members and their families in difficult situations.
The Company is actively developing corporate volunteering. The volunteer programs include:
 ●‘Donor Days’, held in the Corporate Centre and at the Company’s subsidiaries and affiliates, carried out in collaboration with Blood Centre of the Federal Medico-Biological Agency (FMBA) and local 
blood centres twice a year;
 ●A program of targeted aid to childcare centres (volunteer actions, 
‘Letter to Father Frost’, ‘Prepare a Child for School’, ‘Children’s Protection Day’, etc.).
Employee participation in voluntary work adds value to the Company’s social programs with volunteers adding an element of human care to financial aid alone.  Volunteer programs are also important for 
the volunteers themselves: they give employees the opportunity to 
demonstrate qualities that are not needed at work, to gain moral satisfaction and to strengthen team relationships. The Company actively supports volunteer programs as a tool to promote the principle of social responsibility in teams, build the corporate culture, and enhance motivation 
and creativity. Participation of the Company’s top management in such 
programs is a particularly important motivating factor.
