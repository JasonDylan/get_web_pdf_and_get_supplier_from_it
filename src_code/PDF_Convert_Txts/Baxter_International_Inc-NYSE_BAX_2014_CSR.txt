Sustainability at Baxter  
How nations, companies and individuals respond to sustainability challenges such as natural 
resource consumption, ethical business conduct, energy use and access to healthcare and educational opportunities impacts life in the 21st century and beyond. Baxter strives to demonstrate its leadership, values and commitment through its actions to address these pressing issues.
Sustainability is a core element of Baxter’s vision to build a truly great company by providing 
sustainable value for all stakeholders. The company’s sustainability initiatives support its mission to apply innovative science in the development of medical products and specialty therapies that save and sustain patients’ lives.

FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO   GRI  1.1  1.2 
Baxter’s accomplishments and aspirations as a corporate 
citizen depend on our sustainability as a business. We must 
constantly advance and innovate as a healthcare industry 
leader to create lasting social, environmental and economic 
value for the communities we serve worldwide.
We are now approaching perhaps the most consequential 
transformation the company has made in its 84-year history 
of saving and sustaining lives: the separation of Baxter  
into two independent corporations. One, based on our market-leading renal care and hospital products businesses, 
will retain the Baxter International name. The other, 
Baxalta Incorporated, will focus on our premier portfolio 
of biopharmaceuticals. Both will be positioned to thrive in a dynamic marketplace and deliver strong results for their 
many stakeholders.
While Baxter’s corporate profile will shift, our commitment to 
sustainability will endure. It has been a defining Baxter value 
for decades, and will remain integral to everything we do. Our 
executive Sustainability Steering Committee is developing Baxter’s sustainability strategy and goals for 2020 to reflect 
evolving stakeholder expectations, business opportunities, and global and social challenges. Baxalta’s future leadership 
team is also assessing its corporate responsibility strategies in light of its structure, operations and business objectives.
Baxter’s sustainability performance in 2014 reflects the 
many ways our global team is bringing this commitment to life. Over the course of the year, we continued to reduce the company’s carbon footprint, emphasizing the use of lower-carbon fuels and renewable energy. For instance, our Grosotto, Italy, facility switched from heavy fuel to renewable biomass; manufacturing sites in Mexico and Puerto Rico 
converted their boilers from fuel oil to lower-carbon fuels; 
and our new Mississauga, Ontario, facility achieved Canada LEED Gold green building certification.
Baxter also stayed vigilant in responding to global healthcare 
crises and natural disasters. We reacted quickly to the 
outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and, more recently, to the earthquake in Nepal, with multiple airlifts of donated medical supplies, managed through our humanitarian aid partners AmeriCares and Direct Relief. 
In addition, we advanced our award-winning inclusion and 
diversity initiatives, expanded access to our products in developing nations and took numerous other actions in line with our sustainability priorities. You will find the details throughout this report.
I want to thank our employees across the company for 
their unwavering efforts to reinforce Baxter’s position as a sustainability leader, and for integrating our priorities across all aspects of our business. This passion will continue to resonate as we prepare for a new phase in how we live our commitment to operational excellence, social responsibility and greater access to care worldwide.

BAXTER’S APPROACH  GRI  3.5
Sustainability is a core element of Baxter’s vision to build 
a truly great company by providing sustainable value for 
all stakeholders. The company’s sustainability initiatives support its mission to apply innovative science in the 
development of medical products and specialty therapies 
that save and sustain patients’ lives. Sustainability is 
inherently broad, and Baxter’s efforts cover a wide range 
 
of areas, but all are designed to create value for 
stakeholders. See Stakeholder Engagement .
Baxter’s sustainability strategy is further defined by its nine priorities. Divided into the categories Our People, 
Our Operations and Products, and Our World—these 
sustainability priorities have corresponding goals for 2015. 
See 
Priorities and Goals  for detail.
Managing Sustainability 
Baxter’s executive-level Sustainability Steering Committee 
oversees the company’s sustainability strategy and leads Baxter’s efforts to integrate sustainability into its current business activities. The committee’s role is to:
• Assess global challenges, opportunities and emerging 
issues associated with sustainability and set and adjust the company’s sustainability strategy as needed;
• Establish and implement the company’s sustainability 
priorities and goals , track progress, drive organizational 
accountability and recognize individual and team accomplishments;
• Support implementation of sustainability programs 
 
and key projects;
• Recommend actions to continually enhance Baxter’s 
sustainability program and provide progress updates 
to senior management, including annual updates to the 
Public Policy Committee of Baxter’s Board of Directors• Guide and inform Baxter’s sustainability reporting; and
• Solicit stakeholder feedback  and review stakeholder 
inquiries as appropriate.
Committee members sponsor Baxter’s sustainability 
priorities. Each sponsor is accountable for developing  
goals in his or her respective area.
The committee meets quarterly to review progress, to 
discuss how to address any performance gaps and to consider new initiatives. These meetings often feature 
outside sustainability experts to contribute independent 
input and perspectives. Additional groups provide input to 
the committee as needed. Governance and Management of Sustainability at Baxter

In 2013 and 2014, the committee undertook strategic planning,  
looking beyond the company’s 2015 priorities and goals. The 
committee reviewed and defined Baxter’s material issues based on relevance to Baxter and impact on the company and the world. The group also established the company’s sustainability vision, formulated key aspirations and drafted 2020 goals and metrics. The company will publish this plan once approved by senior executives. 
To inform this process, the committee: 
• Assessed the trends most likely to affect Baxter and its 
value chain, including global megatrends such as hyper-connectivity and de-industrialization; healthcare industry trends such as business model innovation and proactive 
health management; and sustainability trends such as climate 
change, fresh water scarcity and population growth.
• Gathered input from Baxter executives, senior leaders, and employees on the company’s 2015 priorities and goals and the 2020 plan;
• Incorporated feedback from Ceres
1 and its select coalition 
members, with expertise in Baxter’s focus areas, on a draft of the 2020 plan; and 
• Reviewed relevant information from sources including the Global Reporting Initiative G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, Ceres and customer feedback. 
Committee members continue engaging with key business 
and functional leaders to integrate sustainability into the company’s business strategies. This drives innovation, performance and competitive advantage for Baxter.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING  GRI  3.1  3.3  3.4  3.5  3.6  3.7  3.8  4.12
Baxter is committed to sharing information about its 
sustainability programs, priorities, goals and performance. This report, the company’s main vehicle for communicating about its social and environmental initiatives and progress, illustrates Baxter’s commitment to sound governance and balanced, transparent disclosure. It also serves as a platform for stakeholder engagement and is an important means for soliciting feedback on the company’s activities.
Through the annual reporting process, Baxter measures and 
evaluates its performance and communicates its progress and challenges. These activities engage and educate many employees and senior leaders on sustainability issues while driving performance improvements. This report also illustrates the interconnection between content areas, such as how product innovation can support access to healthcare in emerging markets and the relationship between water 
consumption, energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Baxter released its first public environmental report in 1992 
and published its first sustainability report in 1999. The company has produced a sustainability report every year since, making this 2014 version Baxter’s sixteenth. 
Baxter discloses information about its sustainability programs and performance through several additional communication channels as well. These include socially responsible investor surveys; award applications; 
press 
releases ; responses to customer requests for proposals; 
governmental reports, such as the U.S. Employer Information 
Report (EEO-1) and the U.S. Toxics Release Inventory; participation in conferences; presentations at universities and industry forums; executive speeches and targeted stakeholder engagement. 
External Reporting Standards 
External sustainability reporting standards promote relevant, transparent, balanced and comparable disclosure of company performance. Baxter was one of the first companies to pilot the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines in 1999 and has served as a GRI Organizational Stakeholder since the program’s inception in 2004.
The GRI Guidelines provide a valuable perspective to 
 
Baxter in its reporting process. Reviewing report content 
against the range of GRI performance indicators helps  
Baxter identify possible reporting gaps and areas that might warrant further disclosure. 
This report aligns with the 
GRI G3 Sustainability Reporting 
Guidelines , application level B (self-declared). See Baxter’s 
GRI Index  for detail.

Impact on Communities
Baxter positively impacts local communities through wages and benefits it pays employees as well as other expenditures and investments. The company currently employs approximately 65,500 people in 67 countries and continues 
 
to expand its global presence in response to increasing product demand. 
In Baxter’s biopharmaceuticals business, which is expected to 
become a separate, independent global company known as Baxalta in mid-2015, there were several developments.
• In September 2014, Baxter 
announced plans  to form a 
new global innovation and R&D center in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, United States, which will serve as the heart of Baxalta’s R&D program. The first phase of the center opened late that year, and additional staff will transition to the new facility during 2015 and 2016. The Cambridge 
facility will house approximately 400 R&D employees. 
• Baxter also formally opened its first advanced recombinant

• Baxter continues to build a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility near Covington, Georgia, United States, to support growth of its plasma-derived therapies.

Baxter also made investments during 2014 related to its 
Medical Products business, which will retain the Baxter name following the separation. 
• In May 2014, the company held an opening ceremony 
for its new R&D facility in Suzhou, China, which 
employed approximately 170 scientists and engineers  
at the end of 2014. 
• Last year, Baxter made a $225 million peritoneal dialysis capacity expansion investment across China, 
 
at manufacturing facilities in Guanghou, Suzhou  
and Tianjin.  
• The company also continued its innovation partnerships 
in India, including an expanded collaboration with Syngene (an internationally respected custom research 
and manufacturing organization) to establish that firm’s Baxter-dedicated research center in Bangalore. 
At the end of 2014, the global research center there 
had approximately 155 Syngene employees working 
solely on Baxter projects. In addition, an ongoing 
collaboration with HCL, a global leader in IT and R&D 
engineering services based in India, has grown from 
approximately 120 engineers in 2013 to 240 in 2014. 
Through these collaborations, Baxter aims to develop 
products for local and global patient needs, which can be scaled worldwide.
• In 2014, Baxter began commercial production on a new line at its Marion, North Carolina, facility—part of an 
approximately $167 million broader investment there 
and at its Mountain Home, Arkansas, facility to expand 
overall sterile IV solutions manufacturing capacity in the 
United States. 
• In August 2014, Baxter shared its plans to invest nearly 
$300 million in its manufacturing facility in Opelika, 
Alabama, to help address demand for dialyzers, a critical 
component used in hemodialysis therapy. The company, 
which currently employs about 170 people at the facility, 
plans to begin hiring an additional 200 workers in 2016.

• Construction also continues at Baxter’s facility in Halle/Westfalen, Germany, to expand capacity to support 
growth of Baxter’s BioPharma Solutions business. Indirect Impacts   GRI  EC9
Baxter’s foremost indirect economic impact is the value of 
its products and innovations (see Scientific Excellence ). By 
using proprietary technologies and proprietary technologies 
and complementary manufacturing platforms across its businesses, the company produces high-quality products cost-effectively for local and regional markets, helping improve healthcare quality worldwide.
For example, Baxter is the world’s leading manufacturer 
of peritoneal dialysis (PD) products, which are self-administered at home to treat patients with end-stage renal disease, or irreversible kidney failure. In China, the dialysis population increases by 10%–12% per year, with 89% of those using in-center hemodialysis and just 11% using PD. Increasing the proportion of appropriate patients treated with PD therapy to 21% of the total over four years could reduce the country’s cumulative five-year dialysis spending by 370 million RMB (US$54 million).
1
The company also conducts economic research, reviews external studies and works to provide governments, healthcare organizations and patients the information needed to make the best possible treatment decisions.
Baxter’s spending also has a multiplier effect on the 
broader economy through, for example, job creation in the supply chain and supporting services such as air travel and hospitality. The company does not calculate these impacts, but believes they are significant given Baxter’s size and scope. For example, Baxter paid its suppliers approximately $7.3 billion in 2014, which those suppliers used to pay their own suppliers, provide their employees with wages and benefits, and pay taxes and other expenses.

Baxter Will Promote Ethical Conduct and Legal Compliance
Continue to champion internal and industrywide ethical 
sales and marketing practices by: 
•  Implementing Baxter’s enhanced U.S. Healthcare 
Compliance Program and International Anticorruption 
Program within the company; and 
•  Working with U.S. and international trade associations, 
non-governmental organizations and governments to harmonize and enforce standards on financial interactions with healthcare providers that allow for appropriate education, research and dialogue on products and services and discourage improper incentives.Baxter is enhancing its policies that govern how the company, its employees and third parties interact with the medical community. This includes investment in new systems and programs that support better management, transparency and compliance for these interactions. For example, Baxter launched its Global Policy on Interactions with the Medical Community and Government Officials in the United States in 2014 and is launching it globally in 2015. 
Through Baxter’s leadership role in The Mexican Association of Innovative Medical Devices Industries 
(AMID), the company partners with health sector stakeholders to promote efficient and transparent regulatory and procurement processes. Further, AMID created an industry code of conduct along with a training program that is offered to distributors in Mexico to increase their employees’ awareness and compliance with anticorruption laws, limits on promotional activity with healthcare professionals and the promotion of ethical business practices. Implement best-in-class programs designed to protect the safety and improve the health of employees that result in performance in the top three of industry peers. In a comparison of 14 healthcare companies,1 Baxter’s performance ranked second best in cases 
with days lost rate in 2013, the most recent year industry benchmarking data were available. In 2014, compared with 2013, Baxter’s recordable case rate worsened by 6%, its cases with days lost rate worsened by 36% and its days lost rate worsened by 50%.

Create and sustain an inclusive culture where diverse ideas, backgrounds, experiences and perspectives are respected 
 
and valued. The company continues to focus on capability building with managers and leaders through a mandatory in-person Power of Managing Inclusively workshop. In 2014, Baxter also continued to focus on its Business Resource Groups (BRGs), which provide a forum for employees to develop skills, strengthen valuable cultural connections and support key business initiatives. These groups support Baxter’s business goals and aim to enhance personal growth and multicultural understanding, while strengthening relationships among employees and with customers, business partners and community partners. Baxter has a total of eight BRGs and has begun to expand some of these globally.Our People    GRI  1.2  3.5
Baxter’s employees worldwide are essential to creating products that save and sustain lives. The company is

program.
Reduce Baxter’s U.S. car fleet greenhouse gas emissions 
per kilometer by 20% from 2007 baseline. In 2014, Baxter continued to integrate sustainable practices into procurement and collaborate with its suppliers on their sustainability programs and progress. Baxter supported educational programs for supplier development through the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and participated in the NMSDC annual meeting and Chicago Business Opportunity Fair to engage with prospective minority-owned suppliers. Baxter remains involved in the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative, a 
healthcare industry group that promotes responsible procurement, risk mitigation and 
supplier capability building to address sustainability risks and improve performance.

In 2014, Gambro (which Baxter acquired in September 2013) completed a life cycle assessment 
(LCA) of CWP 800, a new water purification system used for dialysis. The LCA will be used to create an Environmental Product Declaration (Type II) for the CWP 800 system, which the company plans to publish during 2015. Baxter also worked with graduate students from the University of Wisconsin-Madison to develop a methodology to assess carbon reduction strategies for Baxter Renal Therapy Services in Colombia. The team demonstrated various approaches that 
Renal Therapy Services can use to prioritize carbon reduction opportunities 
across the value chain.
Baxter is committed to enhancing animal welfare through the 3Rs—replacement, reduction and 
refinement. In 2014, the company enhanced its focus on refinement by increasing the amount of 
information collected per study by combining study activities. This refined the approach without increasing animal use.Baxter Will Drive Reductions in its Natural Resource Use
In 2014, Baxter used 10,055 trillion joules of energy, a reduction of 27% compared with 2005, indexed to 
revenue, and an absolute increase of 14%. Baxter’s absolute energy usage rose 4% from 2013 to 2014. 
In 2014, the company used 15.8 million cubic meters of water, a reduction of 32% compared with 2005, indexed to revenue, and an absolute increase of 6%. Baxter’s absolute water consumption increased by nearly 7% from 2013 to 2014

As a global healthcare company operating in more than 100 countries, Baxter is committed to  effective 
corporate governance, adherence to the law and fostering a culture of ethics and compliance 
throughout the organization. In 1995, Baxter became one of the first companies to adopt formal  
corporate governance guidelines. Re-examining the company’s practices and setting new standards is 
ongoing, and the company’s current corporate governance guidelines reflect this evolution.
Baxter’s Ethics and Compliance team works closely with operating and legal teams based 
regionally in Baxter’s businesses to ensure that the company’s activities adhere to applicable laws and to company policies. The organization offers numerous channels to educate and counsel employees as well as confidential avenues to report alleged violations of the law or of company policy. It investigates these items promptly and reports to senior management as appropriate.

Baxter is operated under the direction of the company’s 
board of directors. In 2014, 12 independent directors and Baxter’s chief executive officer (CEO) comprised the company’s 13-person board.
Baxter’s CEO serves as the chairman of the board. In 
addition, the board annually appoints an independent lead director, who presides at executive sessions of the board and serves as a liaison between the other independent directors 
and the chairman. The lead director also reviews meeting 
agendas, works with the chairman to facilitate timely and appropriate flow of information to the board and serves as the contact person for interested parties to communicate directly with the independent members of the board.
Baxter has long adhered to principles designed to ensure effective corporate governance. Since 1995, the board has had 
corporate governance guidelines  in place, which address 
the operation of the board and its committees; strategic and succession planning; and director qualifications, independence and compensation.
Baxter’s board has six committees: Audit , Compensation , 
Corporate Governance , Finance , Public Policy , and Science  
and Technology . Each is made up of independent directors 
and has the authority to obtain advice or assistance from outside experts, as the committee deems appropriate. 
The board meets in executive session at each regularly scheduled meeting. During 2014, the board held eight meetings. All directors attended 75% or more of the meetings of the board and board committees on which they served. Average attendance was approximately 97%. 
View more 
information about the board’s activities and responsibilities .
The board considers candidates for director recommended by shareholders, board members, management and an independent search firm retained by the board to help identify and evaluate potential director nominees. 
 The board evaluates all candidates in the same manner, 
regardless of the source of recommendation, and selects 
directors on the basis of talent and experience. The selection 
process takes into account diversity of background, including 
gender, race, ethnic or geographic origin, age and experience 
(in fields such as business, government and education as well 
as healthcare, science and technology). A nominee’s ability to meet the independence criteria established by the New York 
Stock Exchange is also a factor in the selection process.
Executive Compensation
Baxter’s executive compensation program is designed to 
recognize company and individual performance, drive the 
long-term financial performance of the company (and in 
doing so, encourage innovation and appropriate levels of 
risk-taking), and reflect the value of each officer’s position 
in the market and within the company. The objective of the program is to compensate Baxter’s executives in a manner 
that is consistent with these principles, aligns the interests 
of management and shareholders and drives sustained and 
superior performance relative to the company’s peers. The 
program is also designed to be competitive with companies with which Baxter competes for executive talent in order to 
attract, retain and motivate high-performing executives.
In line with Baxter’s pay-for-performance philosophy, 
executives are compensated based on a range of financial 
and individual performance goals. The goals set for Baxter’s 
executive officers in 2014 reflected the diversity of the 
company’s business and the wide range of responsibilities 
attributed to each of these officers. For example, Mr. Parkinson  
had over 50 performance goals for 2014 covering the following areas: financial performance; organizational 
development and human resources; corporate strategy and 
business development; quality and regulatory; operational 
excellence; board relations and governance; constituent relations (including with respect to sustainability matters); 
leadership; and innovation and R&D.

CODES AND STANDARDS   GRI  4.6  4.8  4.12   SO3
Baxter’s Ethics and Compliance codes and standards 
encompass the company’s relationships with employees, suppliers, healthcare professionals, medical institutions 
 
and patient organizations. 
Code of Conduct 
Baxter’s Code of Conduct  defines the core principles that 
govern employee behavior and how the company conducts 
its business. The Code applies to Baxter’s Board of Directors and all of its employees, including the company’s chief executive officer and other senior management. 
Available in 23 languages, the Code builds on Baxter’s  
long-standing commitment to leadership in ethical business 
practices. It covers topics such as protection and use of 
company assets, accurate recordkeeping, competitive and 
confidential information, sales and marketing practices, 
anticorruption, insider trading, bioethics, conflicts of 
interest, gifts and trade compliance. 
New Baxter employees receive Code of Conduct training 
within their first three months of employment. Baxter’s corporate policies support the Code by articulating the 
company’s commitments, setting behavioral expectations and requiring certain actions. A comprehensive intranet 
site provides employees with additional information on 
corporate policies.
Baxter’s Code reflects evolving regulations and stakeholder 
expectations. It extends beyond employees, by defining 
compliance expectations for the company’s suppliers, healthcare professionals, medical institutions and patient 
organizations working with or for Baxter. The Code includes Baxter’s Global Interactions with the Medical Community 
and Government Officials policy, which covers how the 
company’s employees, contractors, agents and third parties 
conduct themselves with government officials. 
The Code requires prompt reporting of suspected misconduct
 
and outlines the consequences of failure to comply with 
applicable laws or Baxter’s policies and procedures. The company provides ongoing training and a Code of Conduct 
intranet site to keep employees informed about Baxter’s ethics and compliance policies, topic-specific training and 
other tools and resources.

Baxter designed and updates its ethics and compliance 
structure and programs regularly to reflect the needs of a diversified and complex global healthcare company. The company manages programs and activities to help employees make good decisions about appropriate behaviors in the markets where Baxter operates.
Corporate Responsibility Office
The Corporate Responsibility Office  (CRO) was established 
by Baxter’s Board of Directors in 1993 and is composed of nine senior executives. The CRO actively and visibly supports Baxter’s commitment to act with integrity and compliance. The CRO also provides direction and oversight for Baxter’s Ethics and Compliance program.  
The CRO, which meets quarterly, reports to the board’s 
Public Policy Committee and reports on financial matters 
to the board’s Audit Committee (see graphic). Baxter was 
one of the first companies to establish a direct reporting relationship between its CRO and its board, ensuring ethics and compliance oversight at the highest level. At the direction of the CRO, compliance committees operate at the regional, country and business level to drive the integration of the Ethics and Compliance program throughout Baxter. 
Promoting Ethics and Compliance 
In 2014, Baxter participated in Ethics and Compliance Week,  
a global week-long event highlighting the importance of ethics and compliance in the workplace. Employees participated in various activities designed to promote the
 
importance of ethics and compliance, including a presentation 
by the CEO at an all-employee meeting. Employees also 
heard testimonials from business leaders on compliance as a competitive advantage. Additionally, the company provided managers with tools and resources to further educate their teams on this important topic both during the designated 
week and throughout the remainder of 2014.Baxter Ethics and Compliance Structure

Certificate of Integrity and Compliance
Each year, Baxter requires executives, managers, sales 
representatives and other selected employees worldwide to reaffirm their commitment to the company’s ethics and compliance standards by completing and submitting a Certificate of Integrity and Compliance (COIC). The COIC, available in 16 languages, also measures the integration of ethical business practices throughout Baxter. In 2014, more than 16,000 employees completed the COIC.
Legal and Regulatory Compliance Training
Baxter requires employees worldwide to take web-based training on legal and regulatory compliance. In 2014, nearly 57,500 employees completed more than 117,000 e-learning 
courses covering areas such as product complaints, 
pharmacovigilance, adverse-event reporting procedures, 
workplace violence prevention, data privacy, trade  
compliance, requirements for selling to the U.S. government, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, antitrust, intellectual property and Baxter’s ethics and compliance standards. Baxter’s Legal department and Ethics and Compliance group also conducted hundreds of classroom sessions around the world during the year to train employees on the company’s ethics and compliance standards and supporting policies. 
Baxter continued to implement its risk-based anticorruption 
education program to provide awareness-level training 
to most employees, and more advanced training to 
employees who regularly interact with government officials and healthcare professionals. In 2014, Baxter conducted anticorruption training sessions for employees in a variety of roles, including sales, marketing, medical affairs and finance. 
See 
Product Use  for detail about advertising and promotion.
Relationships with Healthcare Professionals and 
Government Officials
Baxter is committed to reporting transparently on its 
relationships with healthcare professionals. This includes the continued implementation of anticorruption programs that 
work to ensure those relationships and related payments are for necessary and genuine services. As a company dedicated to making a meaningful difference in patients’ lives, Baxter’s integrity in this area is paramount. 
Baxter launched its Global Policy on Interactions with the Medical Community and Government Officials in the United States in 2014 and will launch it globally in 2015. Additionally, the company is implementing a phased 
 
rollout of a centralized technology platform linking all of the company’s related interactions worldwide to enhance internal and external reporting. 
During the year, Baxter also enhanced its U.S. Contributions 
Management Program to review and process contribution requests from nonprofit and for-profit healthcare organizations (HCOs). These may include charity events, awards, patient educational events and annual education meetings. A cross-functional Baxter team reviews HCO requests monthly. In 2014, the company received and processed more than 700 HCO requests and approved more than $12 million in contributions. 
Physician Payment Disclosure/Sunshine Act
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, signed into law in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act, requires companies, 
including Baxter, that operate in the United States and that 
manufacture covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies, to track and report certain payments and transfers 
of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals. Manufacturers are required to collect information about 
payments such as consulting fees, travel and lodging, meals, education grants and royalties. 
International Anticorruption Activities
During 2014, Baxter’s Ethics and Compliance team, working closely with other groups and functions in the company, continued to advance its anticorruption program.

This includes periodic assessments and monitoring of Baxter’s 
global operations with regard to key corruption risks. The 
company conducted 16 compliance assessments in 2014 using 
Corporate Audit and Ethics and Compliance resources. In 
some cases, Baxter also used external counsel and external 
auditors. The audits took place in four countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), two countries in Latin America, three countries in Asia Pacific and two countries in North America. Assessment results have shown continued 
progress in awareness, understanding and implementation of 
Baxter’s anticorruption programs. 
In addition to compliance assessments, the company 
conducted compliance self-monitoring in 60 countries, 
including 12 in Asia Pacific, 45 in EMEA and three in Latin 
America. The monitoring, coordinated by the Ethics and 
Compliance team, was led by regional internal controls and country-level finance personnel. 
Also in 2014, Baxter continued global implementation of its 
International Anticorruption Third Party Policy, with emphasis 
on review of and due diligence regarding business partners 
who interface with government officials and agencies in 
activities such as the approval, registration, promotion and 
sales of Baxter’s products and therapies. In line with best practices, the company rolled out a tiered approach to third-
party risk assessment, targeting high-risk countries and third 
parties for in-depth due diligence investigation.   
This multifaceted program includes a robust process to conduct due diligence on relevant business partners, as 
well as to train them on anticorruption laws and Baxter’s 
standards and expectations. The success of the third party program relies on extensive, ongoing collaboration between 
Baxter’s Ethics and Compliance, Legal and business teams, 
as well as with the company’s business partners. 
Trade Compliance
In 2014, the company continued to identify and train a network of key personnel globally, tasked with identifying and addressing related issues in their countries and 
functions, and seeking advice from their designated expert 
as warranted. Baxter also continues to enhance tools and 
processes to screen for and address related risks involving 
its products and business transactions. Additionally, the company expanded training through in-person sessions and its Export Control and Economic Sanctions trade compliance e-learning course. The course raises awareness 
about global export controls and economic sanctions, 
regulations and related company policies. The course also focuses on Baxter’s procedures, as well as employees’ responsibility to ensure compliance in this area. Baxter also conducted Trade Compliance assessments and training at 
newly acquired businesses.
Data Privacy and Security 
In the course of doing business, consumers, patients, healthcare 
professionals, employees and others share personal 
information  with Baxter. The company’s global privacy 
policy  defines Baxter’s privacy standards and guides the 
company’s global operations to follow similar controls for protecting personal and patient health information. 
All Baxter employees are required to complete an online training course on the policy. 
Baxter’s Global Privacy Office addresses three major areas of privacy: patient personal and health information; employee 
personal information; and personal information managed by 
the company’s service providers. Its main role is to govern and oversee privacy compliance. 
Baxter’s Global Privacy Program is composed of U.S. Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Compliance, European Union Data Protection Compliance and Global Data Transfer programs. In 2014, Baxter’s Global Privacy Office continued to monitor and improve the HIPAA privacy compliance program in the United States.

Data Protection Directive. In 2015, the Global Privacy Office 
plans to continue to monitor and maintain the privacy compliance program globally with an emphasis on global data transfer compliance and training Baxter employees.
Information security is a closely related area of focus. Baxter’s Information Technology (IT) Risk Governance 
Board meets quarterly to ensure appropriate accountability, priority and decision-making in response to identified IT risks. A separate cross-functional Information Governance Council oversees the management of business risk related 
 
to security, privacy and legal information. 
Baxter’s Information Protection Program, which includes 
global policies, organizational awareness mechanisms and compliance systems, enforces appropriate use and protection of the company’s information and technology. In 2014, Baxter expanded the program globally, engaging hundreds of employees responsible for protecting sensitive Baxter information. The company also made significant investment in people, process and technology to guard against cyber-attack and data loss. This includes advanced 
threat detection and security analytics technologies at critical junctures within Baxter’s network. Together, these improvements have strengthened the company’s core security capabilities to protect the interests of our 
customers, employees, management and other stakeholders.
COMMUNICATION AND GUIDANCE 
Open communication is central to Baxter’s commitment to integrity. The company offers numerous channels to educate and counsel employees as well as confidential avenues to report suspected violations of law and policy (see graphic), which it investigates promptly and reports to senior management as appropriate. Managers are responsible for maintaining an environment that enables employees to raise and discuss issues safely. In this way, Baxter prevents incidents from occurring and addresses 
issues when they do arise.One such channel is the Baxter Ethics and Compliance 
Helpline, an independent telephone and web resource available to employees and their families, suppliers, customers and other Baxter stakeholders to raise issues and open communications about possible company ethics and compliance issues. Callers can report an issue or seek guidance in any one of 150 languages, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and may choose to remain anonymous. No caller identification features are attached to this line.

In 2014, 335 inquiries from 32 countries were logged into 
the Helpline system and addressed in a prompt, thorough and professional manner. Not all of these inquiries were reports of alleged misconduct or related to compliance. 
Baxter encourages employees to use the Helpline, COIC process and other channels to ask questions and seek advice. Items identified through these channels also help Ethics and Compliance personnel to identify key risks, develop appropriate training, enhance policies and procedures, and design and conduct compliance assessments.
Upon receipt of reasonable indications of suspected noncompliance, the Ethics and Compliance department, working with other functions and in coordination with business leaders, triages and investigates the allegations and takes appropriate remedial action where necessary.

The CEO conducts an annual review of Baxter’s business, regional and functional senior leadership  with the Operations Committee (senior management) to ensure that the company is meeting its global organizational effectiveness and workforce capability needs. The CEO also reviews development and succession planning with Baxter’s Board of Directors, which oversees the succession 
management process to ensure rigor, effectiveness and 
support of the company’s diversity goals.The Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors oversees succession planning for the CEO.

concerns such as healthcare and education.

An inclusive culture and a diverse workforce contribute to 
Baxter’s success and sustainability by driving innovation 
and creating trusted relationships with employees, 
customers, suppliers and community partners. This 
underpins the company’s global inclusion and diversity strategy, which is directly linked to one of Baxter’s 
shared values—respect for individuals and the diverse 
contributions of all. Baxter’s global inclusion and diversity 
strategy focuses on four key areas:

• 2014 Business and Regional Initiatives
• Equal Opportunity for All Employees
• Supplier Diversity
• AwardsGlobal Inclusion Council
Baxter’s Global Inclusion Council provides thought leadership,  
guidance and support to enhance the company’s inclusive 
culture. In collaboration with the Global Inclusion Council, 
businesses, regions and functions worldwide develop local inclusion plans. These incorporate Baxter-wide opportunities
 
in addition to addressing unique local inclusion priorities and requirements. The Council works closely with Baxter’s 
Human Resources Leadership Team and Sustainability 
Steering Committee, which ensures alignment and support 
among the company’s senior leadership. In 2013, the Global Inclusion Council benchmarked the company’s 2013 inclusion 
and diversity performance compared with companies of 
similar size and developed Baxter’s 2014–2016 inclusion and 
diversity strategic plan.
Inclusion and Diversity Training
Baxter’s Power of Managing Inclusively is a four-hour, 
instructor-led, mandatory workshop for all managers, 
supervisors and above. In 2014, more than 5,600 
employees completed the workshop. Also in 2014, the Inclusion IMPACT! series was launched in the United 
States. This online series extends the lessons learned from 
The Power of Managing Inclusively course, continuing to educate managers about inclusion and diversity topics 
 
and providing them with tools they can use immediately  
to build awareness and inclusion on their teams.    
Business Resource Groups
Business Resource Groups (BRGs) provide a forum for employees to develop skills, strengthen valuable cultural 
connections and support key business initiatives. These 
groups support Baxter’s business goals and aim to enhance 
personal growth and multicultural understanding, while 
strengthening relationships among employees and with customers, business partners and community partners. Baxter has a total of eight BRGs: the African-American 
Leadership Council, the Asian Leadership Network, Baxter Employees

Business and Regional Initiatives
Baxter is involved in inclusion and diversity initiatives at its facilities around the world. In Canada and Latin America, Baxter sponsors an annual Inclusion and Diversity Week, during which teams across the regions participate in activities such as town hall meetings, volunteer events and training sessions. In Western Europe, a “Boomers and Millennials” reverse mentoring initiative matches Baxter employees who are recent graduates with senior, long-term Baxter employees to facilitate communication on how 
the different generations can collaborate effectively and 
learn from each other. In Asia, 14 countries are focused on advancing women to critical leadership positions. 
Baxter’s BioScience and Medical Products businesses launched the Women & Ethnic Minority Mentoring program, a diversity-driven mentoring program to accelerate the upward movement of director level and above top talent women and minorities. The program matches mentees with senior leaders from their respective business. There are also specific mentoring programs in the regions and functions. 
Equal Opportunity for All Employees
Baxter is committed to equal opportunity for all employees. Every individual’s unique background and experiences contribute to a successful organization.

More than 40% of eligible employees (regular employees 
working at least 20 hours a week) used one or more of these programs in 2014. Baxter estimates conservatively that it realizes nearly $6 of benefit for every dollar invested in work/life programs through reduced absenteeism 
 
and enhanced productivity. This is based on employee surveys and program utilization data to compare the value of estimated employee time saved with the total cost of 
 
the program.
Alternate Work Arrangements
Alternate work arrangements help to meet employees’ needs for flexibility while supporting Baxter’s business goals. The company’s Alternate Work Arrangement Proposal Kit helps employees and managers to review the steps required for proposing and reviewing requests for flexibility. Determining the most appropriate alternate work arrangement typically considers the employee’s job requirements, personal needs, and work performance, as well as business needs and goals.Supplier Diversity
Baxter works to develop mutually beneficial relationships with small and diverse suppliers. The company plans to continue increasing the diversity of its supplier base to reflect the demographics of Baxter’s customers. See 
Supplier Diversity  for more information.

2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Environment, Health and Safety   GRI  2.8  3.6  3.7  3.10  SO1   
Baxter’s Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) organization manages and coordinates global 
programs and activities to reduce the company’s environmental impacts, create safe and healthy workplaces, and advance product stewardship.
Baxter recognizes the interconnection between aspects of its environmental footprint, such as 
water consumption, energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, producing highly purified water for Baxter’s healthcare products uses significant amounts of energy. As a 
result, saving water also helps the company to reduce energy use and associated GHG emissions. 
Taking a holistic view to understand and decrease Baxter’s environmental impacts is central to the company’s approach. This report covers the ninth year of performance against the company’s EHS 2015 goals, which are integrated into the company’s overarching sustainability priorities.PHOTO :  Employees in Sabiñánigo, Spain,

Scope of Baxter EHS Reporting
• The environmental data included in this report are based on 
129 reporting locations, of which 60 are manufacturing, 24 are warehouse, and 45 are administrative, clerical or other. Several of the reporting units comprise multiple locations that report as a single entity. For example, in 2014, Baxter’s 76 plasma collection centers in North America reported as a single entity, as did the 55 renal therapy sites located in Colombia. The reporting scope excludes certain leased facilities and recent acquisitions for which environmental performance data are not available or are not considered to be material to Baxter’s overall environmental performance.• The health and safety data included in this report are based on 293 reporting locations.

• Regional breakdowns for EHS data are as follows: Asia Pacific; Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and North America.
• The EHS information reported covers 100% of Baxter’s operations. EHS data are revised to reflect acquisitions, divestitures and plant closings as well as to incorporate any corrections necessary due to additional data verification activities (such as EHS audits).1 The scope of Baxter’s health and safety data is different 
than the scope of the company’s environmental data 
because Baxter’s occupational injury and illness 
accounting includes smaller facilities that are not material to the company’s overall environmental 
performance or are reported as individual operations 
rather than as combined locations.35      BAXTER 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

In 2014, as in previous years, the performance 
management objectives of Manufacturing and Operations 
leadership included measures tied to Baxter’s goals to 
reduce safety incidents, energy and water use, and waste 
generation. Also, the company disclosed in its 2015 proxy 
statement  that the goals set for Baxter’s CEO include items  
related to sustainability, and these factor into decisions related to his compensation. 
EHS 2015 Goals
Baxter’s EHS organization conducts strategic planning to establish long-term EHS goals, assess related 
resource needs and ensure critical business alignment. 
The company considers feedback from internal and external stakeholders in determining these goals. The Baxter Manufacturing Council establishes goals for the company’s manufacturing operations annually that include targets related to energy, waste and water reduction, as 
well as safety. These are a part of many senior managers’ 
and plant managers’ annual performance objectives. Yearly manager performance evaluations, including considerations related to compensation, take into account business unit and facility progress in these areas. In 
2014, annual bonuses for leaders in the manufacturing 
organization were, in part, tied to the company’s performance along these dimensions. 
The table (following page) summarizes performance 
against Baxter’s EHS 2015 goals. The company recognizes 
the importance of aspirational targets and in 2011 launched these goals, some of which align with Baxter’s overarching sustainability priorities. See

EHS Management Systems and Certifications   GRI  4.12
 
Baxter’s global Environment, Health and Safety Policy   
and EHS requirements provide the foundation for the 
company’s EHS program, establishing the minimum standards all facilities must meet and maintain. These requirements protect employees and company assets, minimize environmental impact, reduce company risk 
and enhance Baxter’s reputation and EHS leadership. 
The company assesses all of its facilities using the same performance measurement system.
EHS Management System Standards
Baxter follows a management-systems approach guided by its global EHS requirements. The company applies the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 Environmental Management System Standard to systematically manage its environmental aspects and the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001 occupational health and safety management system standard to manage its health and safety hazards and risks. Baxter generally requires third-party certification to ISO 
14001 and OHSAS 18001 for the company’s manufacturing 
and research and development sites, and distribution sites with a capacity of more than 10,000 filled pallets or a workforce of 100 or more people. Facilities that do not meet these criteria still may choose to apply ISO 14001 and/or OHSAS 18001 standards and seek certification to improve their EHS performance.
ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 audits verify whether a facility’s 
management system supports compliance with relevant regulations and company policy. Following a successful corporate EHS audit, Baxter’s external auditing and certification body recommends a facility for certification to these standards.
Bureau Veritas has provided assurance on the content 
in this section.As of year-end 2014, 79 Baxter locations have met the requirements of ISO 14001. Sixty-seven locations are part of Baxter’s ISO 14001 global group certificate, and the remaining 12 locations are certified by other firms. As of year-end 2014, 61 Baxter locations were certified to OHSAS 18001. Fifty-five locations are part of Baxter’s OHSAS 18001 group certificate, and the other six are certified by other firms.
Green Building Certification
In 2010, Baxter approved an EHS policy that requires new sites or those undergoing major renovations to conduct a green building review. The company encourages certification to international building rating standards such as the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the United Kingdom’s Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), and Minergie, the Swiss certification for building energy consumption. As of 
February 2015, eight Baxter buildings were certified to 
green building standards. 
Examples of green buildings at Baxter include the following:
• Canada  Baxter’s office building in Mississauga, Ontario, 
achieved Canada LEED Interior certification in October 2014. More than 90% of employees in the facility have direct lines of sight outdoors, and controls enable 90% of occupants to adjust lighting to meet individual needs. All new wood-based materials are certified to 
Forest Stewardship Council standards.
• Italy  In February 2014, a new facility at Baxter’s Rieti 
manufacturing site was certified to the Italia LEED Gold standard.

EHS Audits
Baxter’s EHS audit process verifies that the company’s 
facilities have EHS programs that achieve regulatory 
compliance and meet Baxter’s EHS requirements, objectives and goals. The company selects facilities to audit based on risk profile, management system certification needs and other factors, such as management turnover and EHS performance 
that does not meet Baxter’s expectations. In 2014, Baxter 
conducted EHS audits at 31 out of 106 applicable facilities.
1 
Of these, 14 were in the company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa region; six were in North America; eight were in Asia Pacific; and three were in Latin America.
The company staffs its audit teams with professionals from 
the corporate EHS audit group and the EHS organization, as well as external regulatory experts as appropriate. External firms conduct certification audits to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System Standard and the OHSAS 18001, as appropriate. When auditors identify gaps in meeting EHS requirements, the audit team guides facility management to identify the related weaknesses in their 
 
EHS management systems. 
Throughout the year, the EHS organization reviews the most common audit findings to systematically target identified issues, strengthen corporate policy when 
 
needed and prioritize company initiatives. The EHS organization’s functional teams then address some of 
 
the areas of greater concern. In 2014, these included material handling and fall prevention. 
Baxter requires closure of regulatory nonconformities within 60 days of an audit’s conclusion, and all other nonconformities within 180 days. Baxter’s EHS Audit Escalation Procedure helps inform senior management 
of any overdue nonconformities and ensures appropriate approval of the extension of any deadlines.
Bureau Veritas has provided assurance on the content 
in this section.In addition to facility audits, Baxter also conducts targeted regulatory risk audits as warranted. In 2014, the corporate EHS group focused on regulatory and EHS risk areas such 
 
as control of energy sources and electrical safety. 
COMPLIANCE
Environmental Compliance   GRI  EN23  EN28  SO8
Baxter assesses its performance in environmental 
compliance using several measures:
• Notices of violation (NOV)  A written notice from a 
governmental agency that identifies environmental noncompliance.

Bureau Veritas has provided assurance on the content 
in this section. Baxter has a goal to decrease overall environmental 
compliance incidents 75% by 2015, compared to 2005.  
Baxter made progress toward this goal in 2014, following structural changes to its wastewater treatment facilities at a large European manufacturing site responsible for 88% of the 2013 incidents. The company maintains its commitment to continuously reduce compliance incidents through 2015 and beyond.
In 2014, most of Baxter’s environmental compliance incidents were related to 
wastewater . These included exceedances of 
15 different parameters, of which the most common was pH (59% of the total).
During the year, 65 of Baxter’s wastewater-related 
compliance incidents occurred at facilities that discharge to regional or municipal wastewater treatment systems. The other three (zinc, copper, and ammonium) were discharged into waterways.
See 
Water and Wastewater  for more detail.
Managing Waste Liability
To manage waste disposal appropriately and minimize the 
risk of future liability, Baxter requires facilities to dispose of all hazardous or other regulated waste at disposal sites that Baxter has inspected or from which the company has otherwise received sufficient assurance of acceptable performance.Baxter applies the same waste site auditing standards 
worldwide and trains internal auditors to evaluate disposal site risk consistently. In addition, Baxter works with CHWMEG, Inc., a non-profit organization that enables companies to collectively purchase expert waste site audits.
Baxter is involved as a potentially responsible party (PRP) 
for environmental clean-up costs at seven Superfund sites. 
Under the U.S. Superfund statute and many state laws, generators of hazardous waste sent to a disposal or recycling site are liable for site cleanup if contaminants from that property later leak into the environment. The laws generally provide that a PRP may be held jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigating and remediating the site. The estimated potential exposure to Baxter for the seven sites 
mentioned above was approximately $8.6 million at year-
end 2014. Separate from the Superfund cases noted above, Baxter paid approximately $206,500 during the year for ongoing voluntary environmental remediation associated with historic operations at the company’s Irvine, California, United States, facility.
Health and Safety Compliance   GRI  SO8
In 2014, Baxter received one health and safety-related

** A product recall in Europe resulted in approximately 9,400 metric tons of total waste in 2011, 13% of 
the 2011 global total. Excluding this waste, that year Baxter would have experienced a 9% increase in 
waste generation in absolute terms and a 23% decrease indexed to revenue compared to 2005.
***Increase in environmental compliance incidents principally due to exceedances of permitted wastewater discharge limits from one European manufacturing location. Baxter expects the number of incidents in 2015 to decrease signi/f_icantly following structural changes to wastewater treatment facilities used by this site.In 2014, Baxter continued working toward its 2015 EHS goals . 
As the graph (left) illustrates, progress toward several of the 
company’s natural resource use reduction goals slowed or reversed during the year. Baxter anticipates that ongoing business growth and changes to manufacturing processes 
during the next several years will continue to present 
challenges to future reduction efforts. 
While Baxter made significant progress toward its environmental incidents-reduction goal during the year, 
considerable progress is still needed to achieve the 2015 
target. See

Air Emissions   GRI  EN19  EN20
Due to an aggressive air toxics reduction program initiated 
in 1988, Baxter decreased toxic air emissions from its operations by approximately 98% during the past 25 years. The company continues to monitor its air emissions and supports facility-led initiatives in this area. However, because of its low emissions levels, Baxter focuses its environmental programs and 
goals  on other priorities .
Baxter’s toxic air emissions increased to approximately 22.5 metric tons in 2014, a 23% rise in absolute terms compared 
 
to 2013 and a 47% reduction indexed to revenue since 2005.  
Key factors included the following: 
• Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), the company’s most 
significant air toxic from operations, increased from 13.3 to 15.1 metric tons primarily due to increased production of products containing PVC materials. 
• Cumene emissions in the graphic increased by 2 metric tons due to rising production of non-PVC products. 
Baxter will continue to evaluate and install emissions-control 
technologies when necessary and feasible to further reduce air emissions associated with manufacturing.
Emissions of sulfur oxides (SO x) decreased by 37% in absolute  
terms from 2013 to 2014. Energy conservation initiatives 
companywide and a transition from heavy fuel oils to lighter diesel fuels and natural gas at some locations have led to these improvements. For example:
• Cuernavaca, Mexico  The facility switched from diesel fuel 
to natural gas to operate on-site equipment such as boilers. This reduced SO
x emissions by 55% in 2014 compared with 
2013. 
• Grosotto, Italy  In 2014, the site transitioned from heavy fuel oil to biomass, reducing SO
x emissions by 37% 
compared with the prior year.

While biodiversity is not a focus of Baxter’s nine 
sustainability priorities , it is an element of Baxter’s Bioethics 
Policy : “Baxter recognizes that protecting the environment 
and maintaining the biological diversity of our planet is 
of vital importance to human life.” By endorsing the Ceres 
Principles , Baxter has committed to preservation of the 
biosphere. Principle 1 states, “we will safeguard all habitats affected by our operations and will protect open spaces and wilderness, while preserving biodiversity.”
Baxter owns or leases approximately 1,000 hectares of land, about one-quarter of which is impermeable surface. Although 22 of Baxter’s 58 manufacturing and research and development sites are located in 11 of the world’s biodiversity “Hot Spots”
1 as designated by Conservation International, 
the company’s operations typically are situated in light industrial areas in metropolitan regions. While Baxter does not require its facilities to report on activities to protect biodiversity, sites are required to understand their impact on the environment and incorporate conservation of biodiversity into their environmental management systems or community outreach programs where appropriate.
Baxter Site Activities in 2014  
During Baxter World Environment Week , the company’s 
signature initiative that engages and educates employees on environmental sustainability, facilities conduct biodiversity-related and environmental-preservation activities. During 2014, 132 sites in 29 countries worldwide held local cleanups, educational campaigns, tree-planting events and other

biodiversity-focused activities. Examples included:
• Australia  More than 30 employees from the Toongabbie 
site participated in the annual “bushcare” initiative in 
a strip of land located near the Toongabbie River. The volunteers weeded, collected garbage, and planted and 
watered native plants. The employees received training on the difference between local native plants and their 
 
look-a-like weeds.
• New Zealand  A group of volunteers from the Auckland facility visited Motuihe Island to plant trees. The mission 
of the Motuihe Trust is to restore, enhance and protect 
the indigenous flora and fauna and the significant historic sites of Motuihe Island.
• United States  Employees from Baxter’s BioLife center 
 
in Waterloo, Iowa, displayed information on the mass dying out of honey bees, the impact of this trend on 
 
the environment and how to prevent it. They also 
provided tips on types of bee-friendly native flowers  
and environments.
Worldwide, Baxter facilities in 14 countries planted 3,075 
trees during the year.
Other Activities in 2014
Chicago Botanic Garden  Baxter has supported the Chicago Botanic Garden in Glencoe, Illinois, United States, for more than 25 years, and contributed financially to the Chicago Botanic Garden Plant Science Center that opened in 2009. The center provides laboratories and teaching facilities for more than 200 Ph.D. scientists, land managers, students, and interns whose research includes preserving biodiversity. Awarded a LEED Gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council, the Plant Science Center also 
serves as home to a unique doctoral program in plant 
biology and conservation with Northwestern University and is the headquarters for the Garden’s international efforts in plant conservation.
Baxter’s ongoing financial support helps the Garden’s 
scientists, researchers and students make vital discoveries about plant survival, habitat destruction, invasive species 
and restoration.
In 2014, more than 50 Baxter volunteers participated in an 
educational event at the Garden, which included removing 
invasive species from several areas in the Garden. Family 
members had the opportunity to learn about butterflies through an exhibit called Butterflies and Blooms. Additionally, 
Baxter sponsors the Garden’s annual celebration of World 
Environment Day in June, which focuses on community 
education. Baxter displays its sustainability efforts with an 
exhibit each year and collaborates with other sponsors on a children’s education theme. Approximately 6,800 visitors 
attended this event in 2014. 
GHG Emissions Reduction  Baxter’s continued efforts to 
reduce energy usage  and associated GHG emissions  from its 
operations and throughout Baxter’s value chain also support 
biodiversity. Pulitzer Prize winning author E.O. Wilson, Ph.D., 
projects that with current global trends, climate change alone may cause an estimated one-quarter of the earth’s 
animal and plant species to become extinct or destined for 
extinction by 2050.

Managing energy use effectively enhances business efficiency 
and conserves natural resources. Reducing fossil fuel 
combustion improves air quality, decreases fine particulates 
that contribute to adverse health effects, and reduces GHG 
emissions . Limiting the use of non-renewable energy sources 
also helps preserve their availability for future generations.
While energy conservation benefits the environment, it also makes good business sense for Baxter, since energy is one of the company’s most significant manufacturing costs. Since 
2005, while Baxter increased sales 56% through 2014, the 
company’s absolute energy usage from operations increased 
by 14%. Due to sharply increasing energy prices, Baxter’s 
corresponding facility-related energy costs rose 69% during 
this same period, to $190 million. This underscores the importance of the company’s ongoing energy conservation efforts. Baxter saved approximately $48 million in 2014 from energy conservation projects that the company has implemented since 2005.
Performance
From 2005 to 2014, Baxter reduced energy consumption from operations by 27% indexed to revenue. This includes the energy used by Baxter-managed and Baxter-operated facilities and excludes company-operated vehicles. Changes in manufacturing processes, and increased production and 
product development activities in 2014 contributed to a 
4% absolute increase of energy usage, compared to 2013. Continued business growth and changes to manufacturing processes over the next several years will present a challenge to future energy-reduction efforts. Baxter is placing greater focus on implementing key energy-reduction projects to help meet the company’s 2015 goal to decrease energy usage from operations by 30% indexed to revenue, compared with 
2005.

this technology at four Baxter facilities. To more accurately track performance, Baxter has adjusted historical electricity purchases at locations that operate cogeneration systems to include losses from generation and transmission normally associated with the utility. This helps the company accurately assess energy efficiency performance over time at those sites.

The table above describes the breakdown of electricity and 
steam consumption for Baxter manufacturing facilities. The company considers these data in targeting new energy-saving technologies, determining where to focus energy balances and setting requirements in the Lean Energy Program. See 
Energy Conservation Initiatives  for examples 
of projects to enhance efficiency in some of these areas.
Baxter’s energy management program incorporates three main components: the company’s Lean Energy Program, energy balances and performance tracking and reporting. 
Lean Energy Program
In 2007, Baxter launched a Lean Energy Program for the company’s principal manufacturing facilities. The program Energy Consumption by Activity, 2014
    Electricity Steam
Boiler Makeup Water     2%
Building Heating/Hot Water    9%Chillers/HVAC    34% Combustion/Distribution Losses    33%Compressed Air    11% Lighting    6%
Production/Sterilization    32% 35%Water Puri/f_ication    7% 16%Other    10% 5%
Total    100% 100%includes four sets of Lean energy standards: Pre-requisite, 
Bronze, Silver and Gold. Each defines 25 to 30 requirements a facility’s energy program must meet to qualify for that level, with a focus on the energy efficiency of facility processes and systems. In general, a site’s Lean Energy Program level correlates closely with its energy efficiency performance. In 2014, a total of 5 sites had achieved gold status. Baxter reviews and updates the program periodically and introduces new sites (acquisitions and new plants).
Energy Balances
Energy balances play an important role in identifying energy conservation opportunities, and applying and sharing new technologies and best practices across the company.
An energy balance is an in-depth analysis of energy 
consumption at the site level. A team of experts assesses most of Baxter’s manufacturing sites every three to four years to understand how energy is consumed at each facility. The team spends approximately five days at each location 
evaluating energy-consuming systems and reviewing 
electricity and fuel invoices to identify opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce GHG emissions and cost.
To encourage the implementation of energy conservation 
projects, which often involves purchasing or upgrading equipment, Baxter has reduced its minimum required internal rate of return for these initiatives by approximately 5% compared to other capital projects.
In 2014, Baxter performed energy balances at the following 
10 facilities: Lessines, Belgium (2); Guangzhou, China, and Shanghai, China; Prerov, Czech Republic; Meyzieu, France; Hechingen, Germany; Sondalo, Italy; Tijuana, Mexico; and Cleveland, Mississippi, United States. 
As a result of energy balances completed in 2014,  
Baxter has identified 215 potential energy conservation projects worldwide representing possible annual savings of $6.3 million.Lean Energy Program Performance

Performance Tracking and Reporting 
Baxter’s corporate energy management group distributes 
a quarterly report to the company’s senior management, 
plant managers and global energy managers. This focuses on Baxter’s Lean Energy Program, energy balance project 
implementation and water usage assessments. It highlights 
progress toward the company’s internal target to reduce 
energy use per unit of production by 3% annually, and helps 
the company identify when performance is lagging so it can 
respond accordingly.
Energy Conservation Initiatives
Examples of projects implemented during 2014 include the following: 
• Poland  Baxter’s facility in Lublin implemented projects 
to recover hot water from processes such as product steam sterilization and equipment cleaning. Capturing and reusing this water saved an estimated $240,000 annually in energy and water combined while reducing associated GHG emissions by 600 metric tons CO
2e.
• Puerto Rico  Baxter’s facility in Jayuya reduced electricity consumption by retrofitting existing lighting to LED lighting. This will save an estimated $70,000 annually and reduce associated GHG emissions by 200 metric tons CO
2e.
• Multiple Plants  Multiple facilities globally, such as Guangzhou and Shanghai, China, continue to implement projects to recover waste heat from product steam sterilization. Projects completed at these sites will save approximately $160,000 and reduce associated GHG emissions by about 610 metric tons CO
2e.
Global Energy Management Activities
Baxter senior management sponsors the company’s 
global energy management activities, which are part of 
an integrated energy-conservation, cost-reduction and GHG emissions reduction program. The program’s success 
depends on the collaboration of Facilities Engineering 
Services; facility energy managers and site teams; 
Environment, Health and Safety; Corporate Services and 
Administration; and Purchasing and Supplier Management.GHG Emissions across the Value Chain    
GRI  3.6  3.9  EN16  EN17  EN29
Global warming and resulting climate change are among the most pressing sustainability challenges facing the world today, posing risks for humans and natural ecosystems. Multinational companies can help address climate change by understanding their impacts across the value chain and decreasing GHG emissions. These are 
core elements of Baxter’s sustainability efforts.
The company began reporting its Scope 1, Scope 2 and 
certain Scope 3 GHG emissions in 1997 and contributed to the development of the initial version of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a collaboration of World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.
Baxter estimates its total GHG emissions footprint (Scope 1, 
Scope 2 and Scope 3) for 2014 at 5.2 million metric tons CO
2e. 
The data reported below are presented in accordance with guidance provided by the GHG Protocol (Scope 1 and Scope 2) and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.
The company’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have a high level of certainty and have been verified for the past five years to a reasonable assurance level by Bureau Veritas North America. Scope 3 categories are based on various assumptions and estimates. For the past three years, Bureau Veritas North America verified to a limited assurance level Baxter’s methodology and emissions factors for calculating Scope 3 GHG emissions. Baxter continues to refine its understanding of the company’s GHG emissions footprint and to implement emissions reduction strategies.
External Recognition
In May 2013, UK-based Environmental Investment Organization recognized Baxter with a 2013 Scope 3 Disclosure Leader Award. Baxter was listed second among all companies in the world for reporting 12 of 15 Scope 3 GHG emission categories.

GHG Emissions from Operations   GRI  3.9  4.12  EN6  EN16  EN17  EN18  EN29  
GHG emissions related to Baxter’s operations are due to 
facility energy use; company-operated sales, distribution  
and other business vehicles; and refrigerant losses.
Baxter’s approach to managing and reducing GHG emissions 
from operations includes 18 program and reduction strategies. Program strategies include developing and 
refining an overall GHG emissions reduction strategy, setting 
GHG emissions reduction goals, measuring and reporting progress, and others. These are complemented by specific tactics to reduce GHG emissions such as energy efficiency initiatives, fuel switching, cogeneration, onsite renewable energy systems, renewable power, and high-performance green buildings.
Baxter’s goal  is to reduce GHG emissions from operations 45% 
indexed to revenue by 2015 compared with 2005. From 2005 
to 2014, Baxter decreased net GHG emissions from operations 
by 8% in absolute terms and 41%  indexed to revenue. As the company continues to expand with new facilities and production operations, Baxter projects it will be challenging to meet its 2015 goal.
Total net emissions from operations of 742,000 metric tons CO
2e in 2014 includes a subtraction of 115,000 metric tons 
CO2e for the following: 
• 88,000 metric tons CO2e of certified renewable energy;
• 17,000 metric tons CO2e of Chicago Climate Exchange 
carbon credits purchased from the Intercontinental 
Exchange; and
• 10,000 metric tons CO2e of carbon credits purchased to 
meet emissions reduction requirements for one Baxter site 
subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.

The following table outlines the sources of GHG emissions 
from Baxter operations during 2014.
View more detail  about Baxter’s energy usage and GHG 
emissions.
In 2014, Baxter used biomass fuels to generate energy in 
boilers at three Baxter locations: Marion, North Carolina, United States (sawdust and scrap wood chips from lumber operations and the hardwood flooring and furniture industries); Alathur, India (coconut shells, rice husks and sugarcane remnants); and Grosotto, Italy (scrap wood chips from lumber operations). Additionally, Baxter’s facility in Waluj, India, purchases steam from a biomass-fueled boiler (residual biomass from sugarcane and cotton) owned and operated by a third party. During the year, emissions from the Baxter-operated biomass boilers equaled 130,000 
metric tons CO
2 and emissions from the third party-operated 
biomass boiler equaled 7,000 metric tons CO2. Following the GHG Emissions from Baxter Operations, 2014*

* See the paragraph below for details regarding emissions from biomass-fired boilers at four Baxter locations.  Greenhouse Gas Protocol,1 these are not included in reported 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions. However, also following the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the company does include CO2e 
emissions from the CH4 and N2O components of biomass 
combustion in its reported Scope 1 emissions. See Baxter’s 
Energy Usage and Greenhouse Gas Emissions  for more detail.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions
Energy usage accounts for 97% of Baxter’s GHG emissions from 
operations, so the company focuses its emissions reduction 
efforts in this area. In 2014, Baxter facilities completed 132 energy conservation projects that reduced annual GHG 
emissions by 12,600 metric tons CO2e. For more detail, see Energy .
In 2014, the Cuernavaca, Mexico, facility transitioned from diesel fuel to natural gas to operate on-site equipment such as boilers. In addition, the Grosotto, Italy, site stopped using heavy fuel oil and switched to biomass. These projects contributed to a combined reduction in GHG emissions of 
almost 5,000 metric tons CO
2e per year.  
RENEWABLE ENERGY
In 2007, Baxter committed to increasing facility usage of 
renewable energy to 20% of total energy use by 2015. In 2014, 22% of the company’s energy use for operations was from renewable sources. Biomass fuel for boilers at four company locations represented 9% of total energy use and the renewable energy component of purchased electricity and renewable energy certificates together represented 13%. On-site geothermal, solar photovoltaic (PV) and solar hot water systems contributed a small amount to the total.
During 2014, Baxter purchased 212,000 megawatt hours 
(MWh) of electricity generated from 100% certified 
renewable power. The company was recognized as the 21st largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the 
United States during the year.

Beginning in 2012, all electricity purchased by Baxter in 
Illinois, United States, was 100% wind-generated, Green-e certified renewable energy. This equaled 78,300 MWh in 2014.
The following table summarizes energy sources used by utilities to generate electricity for Baxter globally in 2007 and in 2014. During that period, renewable energy sources increased from 22.8% to 33.6% of the total.
Baxter also has implemented several on-site renewable 
energy projects. The capacity of the company’s total on-site solar PV and solar hot water systems at year-end 2014 was approximately 1,000 MWh. Examples include the following: 
• 2013   Baxter installed an 836 kWp
1 solar PV system (the 
company’s largest) at its Marsa, Malta, facility.
• 2012   Baxter installed solar hot water and PV systems at 
its Rieti, Italy, facility.1 Kilowatt-peak (kWp) refers to the maximum electricity generation capacity of the system.Energy Sources that Generated Electricity Used

* Based upon the most recent country data available from the International Energy Agency (IEA) 
and the additional renewable energy purchased by Baxter. Unlike Baxter’s 2015 renewable 
energy goal, this table does not take into account onsite renewable energy systems.  • 2011   Baxter installed solar hot water or PV systems at 
its Orth, Austria; Vienna, Austria; São Paulo, Brazil and Cuernavaca, Mexico, facilities.
• 2010-2011   Baxter installed geothermal systems at its locations in Orth, Austria, and Marsa, Malta. (Baxter previously had installed a geothermal system at its office in Munich, Germany.)
• 2010   Baxter installed solar PV systems at its Los 
 
Angeles, California, United States, and Aibonito, Puerto Rico, facilities.
As world energy prices rise and carbon constraints intensify, 
Baxter will continue to adopt renewable energy and alternative lower-carbon fuels, where feasible.
Carbon Neutrality
Since 2007, Baxter has maintained carbon neutrality at its headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois, United States, and its manufacturing facility in Cartago, Costa Rica, through electricity generated from certified renewable energy, carbon credits, and carbon offsets. In both cases, the company offsets facility-related emissions from purchased electricity as well as fuel combusted on site.
Green Buildings
High-performance green buildings provide many benefits that enhance employee productivity and reduce operating expense. Baxter has incorporated green building design principles and has achieved or is working toward U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification at several sites (see 
EHS 
Management Systems and Certifications ).
Carbon Markets
Baxter has used a market-based approach (carbon cap-and-trade) to gain experience in the voluntary U.S. emissions trading market, to offset some of its GHG emissions, and to meet obligations for one facility that is subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.Environment,

Waste   GRI  EN22
 
Baxter has worked to minimize waste since establishing its 
first waste reduction goals in 1996. Initial efforts focused on decreasing potential risk and liability. Since the early 2000s, potential financial gains and process efficiency have also motivated the company’s efforts in this area.
Baxter tracks and analyzes waste data from each major facility to assess progress toward waste-reduction goals and identify opportunities to improve the efficiency of processes that generate waste. The company’s EHS information management system captures waste performance data monthly, enabling quick response when issues arise. Facilities also implement robust waste measurement processes at the point of generation, to rapidly identify significant sources. These and other activities reduce expenses related to raw 
materials, waste handling and disposal. Waste minimization 
also decreases environmental impacts associated with raw materials extraction and refining.
Baxter sites generate different types of waste, so the company’s 
total waste goal  combines non-hazardous and 
regulated waste to encourage each site to focus on the type most relevant to its operations. Baxter has committed to reduce waste generation by 30% indexed to revenue by 2015, compared to 2005. The company identifies leading opportunities to decrease waste based on the highest volume waste streams, facilities that produce the most waste, sites with particularly strong potential to improve 
 
and other factors.
Total Waste Performance
During 2014, Baxter’s operations generated 76,430 metric tons of total waste, up 29% from 2005 in absolute terms and a 17% decrease indexed to revenue.

In absolute terms, total waste increased by 12% during 2014 
compared with 2013. Baxter attributes this to the following: 
• Plasma collection continues to increase at the company’s 
BioLife centers. Although the centers have implemented innovative projects to reduce waste generated per plasma 
donation, these efforts have not offset the overall increase 
due to business growth and improved reporting of waste quantities generated. 
• Baxter’s facilities in Los Angeles, California, United States and Vienna, Austria, sent higher quantities of alcohol waste off-site for disposal or recycling due to operational changes and capacity constraints associated with the facilities’ onsite alcohol recovery stills.
Non-hazardous Waste Performance
During 2014, Baxter’s operations generated 65,000 metric 
tons of non-hazardous waste, 18% more than in 2005 in absolute terms and a 24% decrease indexed to revenue.
Plastic scrap represents Baxter’s largest waste stream, 
comprising roughly one-third of the company’s non-hazardous waste. Baxter’s Corporate Environmental Engineering group continues working with 20 sites to identify improvement opportunities using Lean and Six 
Sigma tools. Nine sites participating in the Plastic Waste 
Reduction Program reduced plastic waste by 535 metric tons in 2014. The San Vittore, Switzerland, facility continues to improve operational efficiency. The site implemented projects that reduced plastic scrap by 10% on an absolute basis compared to 2013, saving nearly 161 metric tons. The Woodlands, Singapore, facility optimized plastics extrusion start up processes to reduce scrap. These initiatives contributed to a 10.5% absolute reduction in plastic waste during the year, representing 155 metric tons.010,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,000

Significant waste reduction efforts during the year related to 
other materials included the following: 
• Mexico  The Cuernavaca facility partnered with a new 
waste vendor to increase total recycling from 70% in 2013 to 81% in 2014. This initiative also raised awareness 
about proper materials sorting, which helped reduce 
non-hazardous waste by approximately 130 metric tons during the year. 
• United States  The Jayuya, Puerto Rico, facility began to use plastic bins to receive supplies, instead of less durable cardboard boxes. In addition, the site started recycling and reusing wooden pallets and metal, and introduced reusable shoe covers. These practices, combined with raising awareness about proper material sorting, contributed to a total non-hazardous waste reduction of more than 100 metric tons compared to 2013. 
In 2014, Baxter also focused on reducing packaging material 
sent to customers. Sites in São Paulo, Brazil; Cali, Colombia;
 
Manesar, India; Grosotto, Italy; and Oued Ellil, Tunis ia; 
implemented initiatives to reduce the use of packaging materials such as cardboard and plastic, saving about 530 metric tons. See 
Packaging  for details.
Regulated Waste Performance1
Baxter generated 11,430 metric tons of regulated waste in 2014, 179% more than in 2005 in absolute terms and a 79% increase indexed to revenue. This represents about 15% of the total waste Baxter generated during the year. Regulated waste increased by 81% on an absolute basis compared to 2013, principally due to increased activity in Baxter-operated plasma collection centers, as well as operational changes and capacity constraints associated with on-site alcohol reprocessing and reuse at the company’s facilities in Los 
Angeles, California, United States; and Vienna, Austria. The 
rise in demand for plasma units donated at Baxter collection centers represents an ongoing waste generation challenge. 02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,000

1 Baxter reports “regulated waste” rather than “hazardous waste.” This term includes 
a broader array of materials that would otherwise be classified as non-hazardous in some countries, which helps Baxter harmonize its waste reporting across locations. In addition to wastes typically considered hazardous (such as toxics and corrosives), the company also includes oils, biohazardous or infectious materials, batteries, fluorescent lamps, asbestos and other materials that may not be defined as hazardous waste by national legislation at the point of origin.

Recycling
Baxter has steadily increased its recycling rate since 2007. Of 
the 65,000 metric tons of non-hazardous waste generated in 2014, Baxter recycled approximately 45,000 metric tons, or 69%. Baxter also recycled 6,890 metric tons of regulated waste in 2014, for an overall recycling rate of 68%.
1
Recycling activities at Baxter generated nearly $6.1 million in net income in 2014. Although some recycled waste streams do not generate revenue, in those cases recycling typically still costs less than disposal. Recycling proceeds in 2014 decreased by 15% compared with 2013 due to an increase in regulated material recycling, which represents an expense rather than revenue.
Four manufacturing sites and one R&D facility have diverted 95% or more of their waste from landfill. Those sites are: Alliance Park, Braine l’Alleud, and Lessines, Belgium; Cartago, Costa Rica; Liverpool, England; and San Vittore, Switzerland.Waste Management at Baxter, 2014

Water issues continue to grow in visibility and importance 
worldwide, and many consider access to clean water to be a basic human right. Although these concerns are global, addressing water issues requires action at a local or regional level. Due to the location-specific nature of water issues, companies first must understand water risks associated with individual operations before they can take appropriate and meaningful action. 
Water is integral to many of Baxter’s products and 
manufacturing processes, so water conservation and reuse are key focus areas for the company. Baxter works to better understand the impacts of its water use across the value chain, and implements conservation and efficiency projects at its manufacturing facilities to improve performance.
Baxter is dedicated to reducing water consumption by 
35% indexed to revenue by 2015, compared with 2005. The company also has committed to implement two projects by 2015 to help protect vulnerable watersheds and provide communities with enhanced access to clean water.
Water consumption, energy usage and GHG emissions 
are interrelated, including within Baxter’s manufacturing operations. As water quality decreases, Baxter will need to use additional energy and water for the production of highly purified water used in manufacturing.
Water Usage
Baxter closely manages how it obtains, uses, treats, re-circulates  
and discharges water. In 2014, the company obtained approximately 43% of its water from on-site wells and the remainder from municipal water distribution systems.
During 2014, Baxter used approximately 15.8 million cubic 
meters of water,1 roughly equivalent to filling 17 Olympic- sized swimming pools every day. This equaled 5.5% more water 
than in 2005 in absolute terms and 32% less indexed to revenue. Baxter used nearly 7% more water in 2014 than in 2013, largely due to production growth in the Asia Pacific region, along with changes in manufacturing practices and product development activities at numerous Baxter facilities globally. Although the company continues to focus on water and energy reduction projects to help meet its 
2015 goal , 
Baxter anticipates that business growth and manufacturing process changes during the next several years will present a challenge to future water-reduction efforts.

Baxter uses water in three main ways:
• Process-related operations include cooling towers, chillers, 
steam boilers, sterilizers and water purification (80% of total);
• Purified water in the company’s solution products (15% of 
total); and
• Other uses such as in bathrooms, cafeterias and landscaping (5% of total).
Water Conservation
Facilities with water-intensive operations develop site-specific 
water efficiency initiatives and metrics. EHS and Facilities Engineering Services personnel review performance to identify best practices for application at other locations.
Baxter considers several factors to identify water usage reduction opportunities and possible water conservation projects at sites, including total water used, water usage efficiency and water cost and availability. Due to the strong link between energy usage and water processing, optimizing 
water systems remains a key focus of the company’s 
facility 
energy assessments . Additionally, Baxter integrates Lean 
manufacturing principles and tools such as value stream 
mapping1 with water management to help facilities identify 
areas for additional conservation.
During 2014, Baxter implemented water recovery and reuse 
projects at several facilities: 
• Poland  Product sterilization and equipment cleaning are 
often water- and energy-intensive. Baxter’s Lublin facility 
implemented a system to recover heated water from these 
processes for reuse in product sterilization, which also 
decreases the need to cool hot water generated from cleaning. This project reduced water consumption by an estimated 31,000 
cubic meters on an annualized basis while saving energy.
• Spain  Baxter’s facility in Sabiñánigo completed a project to reuse water from the water purification process. This 
reduced water consumption by approximately 12,500 cubic 
meters annually while saving energy. Water-Stressed Locations
Water issues vary significantly by location. Baxter used 
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Global Water Tool in 2012 to evaluate the availability of renewable water resources at Baxter’s 52 largest water-consuming locations, which represent more than 96% of the company’s total water use. Twelve of those sites are located in water-scarce areas, 11 in water-stressed areas and 29 in water-sufficient areas (see second note on graph below).
1 Water value stream mapping is an interactive, Lean manufacturing tool that helps 
facilities better understand the quantity and quality of water used in their processes and identify opportunities for reduction or reuse.Environment,

Water usage in water-scarce and water-stressed areas 
increased approximately 6% in absolute terms and decreased about 2% indexed to production in 2014 compared with 
 
2013. Water consumption increased at these locations primarily due to production growth to meet local market demands and elevated water use in certain processes that support manufacturing.
Baxter has established partnerships with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to implement projects to help protect vulnerable watersheds and 
 
provide communities with enhanced access to clean water and sanitation.
Throughout 2014, Baxter continued working with the 
Philippine Center for Water and Sanitation (PCWS) to improve water, sanitation and hygiene conditions for the nearly 1,500 inhabitants of Sitio Silangan, a community located in a water-scarce region and within walking distance of the company’s manufacturing facility in Canlubang, Philippines. PCWS builds the capabilities of communities, households, NGOs and other groups to address these challenges throughout the country. 
Efforts in 2014 included the formation of the Sitio Silangan 
Water and Sanitation Association, which is composed of 
local residents trained in the construction, operation, repair and maintenance of newly installed water and sanitation 
equipment. To increase its impact, this association has joined 
with NGOs and the local government to promote similar technologies for surrounding communities. Through the end 
of 2014, community residents, along with PCWS, built eight 
additional biogas digester septic tanks in Sitio Silangan (for a total of 12), 13 iron removal filters (15 total), eight rainwater 
harvesting tanks (10 total), and 10 biosand filters (60 total). 
The Development Center for Asia Africa Pacific recognized this project as among “Best Practices in Implementing Water, 
Sanitation and Hygiene Programs and Health Promotion in 
the Philippines.”Baxter has also partnered with Sarar Transformación SC to implement a community water project near the company’s Cuernavaca, Mexico, facility, which is located in a water-stressed region. The project’s goals are to improve the water and sanitation infrastructure at three local schools and provide education on water sustainability and sanitation to residents in the area of Tepoztlán. During 2014, the project team installed three rainwater harvesting systems and two biofilter treatment systems. Combined, these capture or 
reuse approximately 1,400 cubic meters of water annually. 
Under the program, Sarar Transformación educated nearly 970 students, parents, school staff and community members on water conservation and sanitation.
Wastewater
Wastewater discharged from Baxter’s production operations represents one of the company’s most significant 
environmental compliance  risks. In 2014, 80% 
of Baxter’s self-reported environmental incidents were exceedances of permitted wastewater discharge limits, and 59% of the wastewater exceedances were related to pH 
excursions. The pH parameter is monitored continuously, 
and each exceedance, no matter how minor, constitutes a self-reported incident.
To address existing wastewater compliance issues globally and to anticipate potential future ones, Baxter continues to pursue an aggressive approach to wastewater compliance, evaluation and risk mitigation. Learning from recent issues, the company has implemented a systematic wastewater risk management program that proactively identifies emerging issues. This involves a holistic review of major manufacturing locations that includes the following:
• Evaluate effectiveness of facility change management 
processes used to assess possible impacts to wastewater generation and compliance;
• Review wastewater compliance history to identify possible trends and areas of concern;Environment,

• Verify the effectiveness of procedures used to monitor 
compliance with wastewater permit conditions and methods used to investigate and remedy causes of non-compliant wastewater discharges;
• Use five-year production forecasts to compare wastewater treatment capacity and capabilities with anticipated production changes; and
• Gauge employee awareness of wastewater operations and 
roles in ensuring compliance.
In addition to this program, the EHS Audit group periodically 
has performed targeted wastewater assessments since 2011. These reinforce the importance of understanding the effects 
of wastewater discharges on compliance, and on proper management of wastewater treatment.
Baxter-Operated Wastewater Treatment Systems
Twelve of Baxter’s manufacturing operations treat 
wastewater on-site and either discharge to a waterway or 
operate as zero-discharge facilities. These facilities typically 
do not have access to regional or municipal wastewater-treatment systems. For example, Baxter’s facilities in Alathur 
and Waluj, India, reuse all treated wastewater on-site for 
landscaping and irrigation or, after further treatment by 
reverse osmosis, for cooling towers. In 2014, these 12 facilities 
treated more than 4.3 million cubic meters of wastewater, nearly 27% of Baxter’s total water consumption.
The combined treated effluent from the 10 facilities that 
discharge to a waterway have average concentration levels of 
wastewater pollutants (see table) that are generally regarded 
as indicators of adequately treated wastewater and are well below typical regulatory discharge limits.
Wastewater and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients
Baxter takes seriously concerns about active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) entering the public water supply. The 
company primarily produces solutions whose principal 
ingredients include water, salts and simple sugars. However, Baxter purchases and uses some solution therapies and 
products for injection that include APIs.The company properly manages the APIs that it uses to help ensure they are not released into the environment during manufacturing. Baxter has developed proprietary processes to remove, destroy or deactivate some compounds though not required to do so by law. All other compounds that cannot be managed this way or through traditional wastewater management systems are destroyed by incineration or other environmentally responsible means.
Complementing these global processes, each Baxter facility determines the most effective and environmentally responsible method of protecting the public water supply and public health in accordance with company policies and local regulations. For example, Baxter’s major research and development facility in Round Lake, Illinois, United States, has an ongoing program launched in 1989 to evaluate its solution products, including those containing APIs, for their removal in wastewater treatment systems. The company shares this 
information with Baxter facilities around the world.

2014 ENVIRONMENTAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT   GRI  3.9  EN30
 
Baxter’s EHS function pioneered its Environmental Financial 
Statement (EFS) in 1994 (covering 1993 data). The EFS demonstrates the value of the company’s proactive global environmental management program to EHS team members, senior leadership and other stakeholders. Historically the company has typically demonstrated a return of approximately three dollars per year for every dollar invested.
In 2014, environmental income, savings and cost avoidance equaled a net loss of $10.7 million for initiatives completed during the year, compared to net gains of $8.8 million in 2013 and $20.3 million in 2012. This was only the second time since Baxter began producing its EFS that the company did not realize net positive environmental income, savings and cost avoidance. Costs related to unexpected waste management activities were the main contributing factor. EFS analysis helps Baxter determine where to focus 
additional resources for greatest impact, and in the past 
year, Baxter has continued to focus on waste generation and related performance. The company expects to benefit from those efforts in the future. 
The most significant factors that influenced performance in 
2014 included the following:
• Regulated waste  Regulated waste increased by 81% in 
absolute terms compared to 2013, principally due 
 
to growth in Baxter-operated plasma collection centers 
and limitations with alcohol recovery and reuse at the 
company’s Los Angeles, California, United States and 
Vienna, Austria, sites. This significantly increased  
costs associated with regulated waste disposal, and 
regulated materials.
• Energy  Increased average utility energy rates and 4% higher energy consumption compared to 2013 adversely 
impacted net energy cost savings and avoidance. Total estimated environmental income, savings and cost

 To develop 2015 safety targets, Baxter’s 2014 year-end rates were amended to include 2014 data 
from a few new acquisitions that will be included in externally reported safety data in 2015. 
 All rates based on 100 full-time employees working one year, which equals 200,000 work hours. 
For tracking purposes, Baxter follows U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
recordkeeping requirements worldwide. Thus, in cases where an injury occurs and conflicting 
medical opinions arise as to the number of days away and/or restricted days that should be 
recorded, Baxter records on the basis of the most authoritative physician’s opinion. Rates 
exclude acquisitions until January 1 of the first year following at least 18 months with Baxter.
 Recordable cases  – Work-related injuries or illnesses requiring medical attention beyond  
first-aid, including cases with days lost.
 Cases with days lost – Work-related injuries or illnesses that cause an employee to lose at 
least one full day after the date of the incident.
  Days lost  – The number of days lost (including weekends and holidays) recommended by the 
most authoritative physician's opinion due to work-related injuries or illnesses. Baxter does not 
count the date of injury and date of return to full duty as lost days.
  Restricted days  – The number of days recommended by the most authoritative physician's 
opinion that an employee or supervised contractor is unable to work full duty (including weekends and holidays) due to a work-related injury or illness. Baxter does not count the date of injury and date of return to full duty as restricted days.
  DART – The combined number of days lost, restricted days and days transferred to another job 
function (including weekends and holidays) due to a work-related injury or illness severe enough to prevent working full duty. Baxter does not count the date of injury and date of return to full duty in the DART calculation.
 Serious workplace incidents are work-related incidents that result in an employee or contractor 
being hospitalized overnight, sustaining an amputation or dying. This designation also includes any employee chemical or radiation exposure requiring government notification. This data includes new sites and acquisitions.******

0102030In 2014, Baxter’s safety performance worsened for the three 
main indicators tracked (recordable case rate, cases with 
days lost rate and days lost rate). Regional performance summaries include the following:
• Asia Pacific  The recordable case rate improved by 18% 
due to sharpened focus on ergonomics and increased  safety communications throughout the region. The cases with days lost rate improved by 5%. The days lost rate 
improved by 28% due to a focus on case management, 
with the restricted days rate improving by 89%.• Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA)  Within EMEA 
the focus is on reducing overall recordable cases, not just 
lost time cases. Safety incidents in the region increased 
for the first time in five years. The recordable case rate rose by 10% due to expansion of existing facilities including validation of new product lines, as well as 
adjustments within facilities in preparation for the split of 
the company in 2015. 
• Latin America  The recordable case rate worsened by 
73%.  Recordable cases in Renal Therapy Services (RTS) 
clinics in Latin America increased by 122% (80% of which Environment,

were needle sticks, cuts and punctures). During 2014, the 
RTS clinics focused on re-deploying safety and health programs, which led to improved employee and leadership reporting of injuries. As a result, clinics have implemented several corrective and preventive actions to minimize risk exposure and better drive a culture of a zero-harm.
• North America  The recordable case rate improved by 2%; however, the cases with days lost rate worsened by 20% and the days lost rate worsened by 27% due to significant management transition and increased production demands at a large manufacturing facility in the region. In addition, BioLife centers experienced a 
significant increase in days lost and the days lost rate, 
with a single case accounting for more than half of the total days lost for the centers.
Baxter’s overall safety performance since 2005 has improved 
significantly:
• 39% reduction in recordable case rate
• 56% decrease in cases with days lost rate
• 50% reduction in days lost rate
In a comparison of 14 healthcare companies,1 Baxter’s 
performance ranked second in cases with days lost rate in 
2013, the most recent year industry benchmarking data were 
available. Although this placement puts Baxter on course to achieve its 
2015 safety-related goal , maintaining and 
improving this ranking will require continuous enhancements 
to the company’s safety systems and strategies.
Analysis of Injuries and Serious Incidents
Baxter’s safety function regularly evaluates the main sources 
of work-related injuries at the company to identify trends and address opportunities for improvement. The following chart shows the sources of recordable injuries and serious incidents at Baxter in 2014. Two major sources of injuries and illnesses for the past eight years (when the company began analyzing these data) have been ergonomic issues and slips, trips and falls. Baxter has initiated focused programs in each

Serious Incidents
Serious workplace incidents are those that result in an 
employee or contractor being hospitalized overnight, sustaining an amputation or dying. This designation also includes any employee chemical or radiation exposure requiring government notification.
When a serious incident occurs, facility management 
conducts an evaluation and follows formal processes and reporting mechanisms to share knowledge throughout the company to prevent reoccurrence. Regional and business EHS groups are required to prepare and distribute
 a report 65      BAXTER 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

Management and Initiativesabout the incident, according to Baxter’s global EHS 
requirements. In addition, safety personnel discuss  
each incident with the vice president of EHS and the corporate safety director to evaluate root causes and 
preventive measures.
Serious incidents increased at Baxter in 2014 (13 incidents; 
three involving contractors) compared to 2013  (eight 
incidents; three involving contractors). No fatalities 
occurred. Baxter’s new system to classify the severity  
of incidents and near miss occurrences is designed  
to better understand and prevent the precursors of 
serious incidents.
Safety Program Management and Initiatives
Baxter’s safety, occupational health and industrial hygiene functions establish the company’s strategies in those 
areas and sponsor global teams of corporate, regional, site and business-unit safety professionals to help refine and implement related approaches. These teams set priorities and establish, maintain and continually improve global programs and initiatives.
The company uses several indicators to measure safety 
performance at Baxter. Recordable case rate and cases with days lost rate are integrated into senior managers’ annual performance management objectives and impact 
their compensation. The company also tracks serious 
incidents and evaluates each one that takes place, to fully understand root causes and prevent recurrence. The EHS organization reports employee safety performance to Baxter’s senior leadership every other month and to 
Baxter’s manufacturing and supply chain management 
monthly. The EHS organization also communicates this 
performance to the company’s Board of Directors.Enhancing Safety Culture and Performance
In 2013, Baxter strengthened its three-pronged approach to 
enhancing its safety culture and performance based on a review of historical performance trends.
FOCUSED INJURY-REDUCTION STRATEGIES
Injury and illness metrics and internal EHS audits provide focus for the company’s safety and occupational health efforts. Baxter continues to target ergonomics and slips, trips and falls, the top sources of injury within the company.
Ergonomics  Baxter developed an ergonomic integration 
strategy in 2013 to embed related considerations into existing management systems. The company expanded the strategy in 2014 to more effectively integrate ergonomic 
concepts at Baxter. The strategy consists of the following:
• Measuring risk to drive decision making  Baxter provides 
facilities with tools to quantify ergonomic risk following 
the company’s risk measurement strategy.
• Engaging facilities in ergonomics  Baxter provides facilities 
with a consistent framework to manage ergonomics.
• Incorporating ergonomics into engineering designs Engineering design concepts ensure equipment fits worker characteristics and capabilities. Baxter’s ergonomic design guidelines and training for engineering personnel support ergonomic injury prevention.
• Applying lean ergonomics to reduce wasted motion  Lean 
ergonomics eliminates wasted human motion, improving 
productivity while reducing ergonomic risk. 
Fall Prevention
1  Baxter continued to maintain and enhance its 
fall prevention resources in 2014. The company developed new 
training and four safety bulletins to reinforce fall prevention strategies at the facility level. In addition, the company documented and distributed two fall prevention best practices.

Management and InitiativesTHE FUTURE STATE OF SAFETY AT BAXTER
Baxter launched the “Safety 
Connection” intranet portal in 
January  2014, following extensive 
benchmarking with internal centers of excellence and with other companies. 
This led to establishing the vision of the company’s Future State of Safety. The portal defines critical safety behaviors at four employee levels, and provides tools and resources 
to enhance employee ownership of safety. More than 135 Safety Agents were designated at Baxter locations to assist with communication and deployment at the facility level. Also in 2014, Baxter identified the need to enhance people manager safety leadership skills. The company 
designed a modular training initiative, which it piloted at two manufacturing facilities in 2014 and plans to deploy at 
selected sites in North America and Latin America in 2015 .  
EMPHASIS ON HIGH-HAZARD SOURCES
Severity Classification System  During 2014, Baxter continued to implement the BioScience high-hazard identification process  with more than 1,400 hazard assessments completed since its deployment in 2012. 
 
The company also deployed a system to ensure that all EHS incidents are categorized according to potential severity, and that the company devotes appropriate resources to discover the root causes of events, correct them and prevent reoccurrence. 
Other Safety Programs and Initiatives
ELECTRICAL SAFETY, MACHINE GUARDING AND LOCKOUT/
TAGOUT
During 2014, Baxter strengthened its electrical safety, 
machine guarding and lockout/tagout1 programs by 
deploying enhanced policies and guidance documents  
and implementing verification requirements at the facility level. If not handled properly, these safety program 
 
aspects can result in serious injuries. NEAR MISS REPORTING
Near miss reporting continues to be an effective strategy to engage employees in identifying and mitigating workplace hazards. Baxter uses 10 criteria to define an effective near 
miss program, including the expectation that sites will investigate serious near miss incidents and implement appropriate corrective and preventive actions. Using these criteria, Baxter verified effective programs in 76% of locations with 100 or more employees, exceeding the company’s goal of 75%.
Health and Wellness Program Management  
and Initiatives
Baxter’s occupational health function develops the company’s health and wellness strategies. A global team of diverse health professionals helps refine and implement these approaches. This team defines specific priorities 
and establishes, maintains and continually improves global 
strategies in this area.
BeWell@Baxter
Baxter recognizes that healthy employees are more likely 
to be engaged and productive, and are less vulnerable to safety incidents and injuries. Through BeWell@Baxter, the 
company’s global employee health and wellness effort, 
Baxter strives to create a culture that promotes work-related and personal health, raises awareness about these issues and supports individual accountability and engagement.
The cornerstone of BeWell@Baxter is the Personal Wellness Profile, an online health risk assessment that helps employees understand how their lifestyle choices, family history and 
other factors impact their health. By the end of 2014, 29% 
of the company’s employees worldwide had completed a Personal Wellness Profile.

To address this, Baxter established a year-long theme of 
“Total Well-Being — Emotional Health” and encouraged all locations to plan awareness-raising events on this topic.
Also in 2014, more than 14,000 employees (up 31% compared  
to 2013) logged more than 200,000 hours of exercise  
(up 13%) as part of the BeWell@Baxter Exercise Challenge. Seventy-one percent of employees (up from 68%) from 
 
180 facilities worldwide (up 31%) took part in “Healthy Eating Month.”
Other Programs and Initiatives
Baxter’s occupational health team also works to continually improve the company’s performance with the following programs and initiatives:
• Flu vaccine  In 2014, Baxter offered free seasonal flu 
vaccinations to 99% of its employees. A total of 21,471 employees were vaccinated, representing 36% of the company’s total population. In addition, 299 vaccinations were provided to family members.
• Health promotion programs  In 2014, 74% of targeted facilities (those with 100 or more employees) achieved at 
least eight out of 10 health-promotion program criteria, 
exceeding the goal of 65%.
• Smoke-free workplaces  The company strengthened its commitment to providing a smoke-free work environment with 91% of campuses totally smoke-free in 2014 (up from 89% in 2013). 
CASE MANAGEMENT
Baxter has established strong capabilities at the facility level 
to effectively manage work-related injuries through early intervention and prompt treatment. The company maintains a network of local program owners, which it supports through ongoing case management education. In 2014, 85% of all locations with 25 or more employees had a case management program in place, according to defined criteria.PRIORITIES ADDRESSEDTOPICS IN THIS SECTIONSustainability

Promoting product quality and patient safety is at the core of everything Baxter does. The company was founded in 1931 on its ability to produce safe intravenous (IV) solutions for hospitals at a time when most were not equipped to prepare their own. Every day, Baxter products make a difference for millions of patients worldwide. The company’s reputation and ongoing success depend on the quality and safety of its products and services, so uncompromising dedication in these areas is a guiding principle of Baxter’s culture and is 
among its 
shared values . 
Quality
Baxter’s global quality management system provides a 
single, global companywide standard for quality. This system supports a consistent approach to managing quality across the product life cycle, including design, development, manufacturing, sterilization, labeling, packaging, distribution and promotion. It helps to address the complexities of 
managing quality across interconnected businesses, regions 
and manufacturing operations, enhancing the company’s ability to meet standards and to adapt to changes in a complex regulatory environment. 
Baxter regularly evaluates and reviews its quality 
management system to identify and correct issues that may affect product and service quality, and pursues continuous improvement through a range of data-driven methodologies. Simplifying processes is one focus, which increases efficiency and prevents potential quality issues from occurring. Baxter also assesses its suppliers of raw materials, components and finished goods to track and enhance their performance. After products are launched, the company executes post-market surveillance to monitor the safety, efficacy and quality of products while in use.  
When Baxter identifies a potential quality or patient-safety 
issue with one of its products, or determines that products 
manufactured or marketed by the company do not meet 70      BAXTER 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

company specifications, published standards or regulatory 
requirements, it investigates and takes appropriate 
preventive and corrective actions. This may include patient  
risk mitigation actions, such as training healthcare professionals and/or patients, notifying customers about 
revised labeling, correcting problems at the customer location, withdrawing products from the market and other actions. 
Through a quality enhancement initiative, Baxter is transforming its approach to product safety. The company focuses on proactive risk identification and mitigation, as opposed to only responding after identification of a quality or safety issue. This effort is critical not only to patients and healthcare providers, but also to regulators who exert strict oversight across the industry regarding product issues. With governance and guidance from an executive quality council, this approach focuses on continual risk reduction, clear 
accountability for the safety and quality of products across 
the life cycle, assessment of the state of the quality system and continuous improvement.
Baxter takes any self-identified quality or patient safety issues or findings by regulatory authorities very seriously and establishes comprehensive plans to address them. While executing these corrective actions, the company also assesses the potential to leverage these improvements more broadly.
Baxter’s operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies worldwide.

Safety
Baxter focuses on safety across the product life cycle, from product development and enhancements to post-market research, pharmacovigilance, device vigilance and other post-market surveillance activities. For example, Baxter’s pharmacovigilance function identifies, confirms and communicates pre- and post-market drug safety signals to the appropriate stakeholders and authorities. Through product labeling and risk management activities, the department develops and executes approaches to ensure a positive benefit-risk balance of Baxter’s therapeutic drug products and medical devices. The company also collaborates with hospitals to assess their patient safety processes and partners with customers and third parties to 
develop patient and clinician educational materials and raise 
safety standards. 
The company has continued to expand its portfolio to 
address hospital safety and efficiency issues. In February 2014, Baxter acquired ICNet Software, a company that produces surveillance and case management software for infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship—efforts designed to encourage appropriate use of antimicrobials— and clinical pharmacy support. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that hospital-based programs dedicated to improving antibiotic use can improve treatment of infections and may help reduce adverse events related to inappropriate antibiotic use. Findings also show that these programs significantly reduce hospital rates of antibiotic resistance.

features include automatic calculations and barcode verification of ingredients, which help reduce preparation errors and facilitate uniform processes among users. Since March 1, 2008, 1.7 million potential preparation errors have been identified using the DoseEdge System, out of 32.3 million prepared doses.
1 Baxter also works to advance clinical 
practice and promote public-private partnerships in this field. Baxter’s SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pump, which features Dose Error Reduction Software and customizable Master Drug Libraries with facility-defined dosing limits to reduce infusion-related adverse drug events, 
received the “Best in 
KLAS” award for Smart Pumps—LVP  in the 2014 Best in KLAS: 
Medical Equipment & Infrastructure Report. 
PRODUCT INTEGRITY
Counterfeit and/or adulterated medical products pose risks to patient safety worldwide. Maintaining product integrity is a complex and multifaceted challenge, encompassing an array of risk management, supply chain, product design and packaging strategies. Baxter’s product integrity program takes into account the differing levels of complexity and risk associated with individual products and markets.
The company has conducted a series of risk assessments, 
examining economic incentives, supply chain and product complexity, and other factors that may contribute to this issue. Based on that analysis, Baxter prioritized certain product lines and geographies for piloting and implementing various product authentication and security measures.
Risk Assessment and Monitoring
Baxter has conducted an extensive review of its product portfolio and geographic presence to assess the level of risk associated with individual products by market. The highest priority products and markets were earmarked for initial implementation of various product integrity measures, including multiple layers of product packaging features Collaboration

Supply Chain Measures
Maintaining a secure supply chain, from Baxter to the 
end user of the product, is essential to ensure product 
integrity. Direct sales and sole source agreements are one 
way the company can retain control and/or visibility of the 
product. Baxter regularly monitors customer purchasing data and trends and has terminated or changed customer relationships after detecting actions that jeopardize supply chain integrity (e.g. resale of product, unexplained spikes or 
changes in ordering behavior that would suggest diversion). 
Baxter’s sales contracts include restrictions that support supply chain transparency and control, including the destruction of product packaging in some markets.
Additionally, the company was an early adopter of GS1 
standards adopting the Global Trade Item Number 
(GTIN) in 2004. A GTIN is a unique identification number 
that provides the link between the product and the information pertaining to it. GS1 standards are used to uniquely distinguish all products, trade items, logistic units, 
locations, assets and relationships in the supply chain—
from manufacturer to consumers. Baxter believes that global adoption of GS1 standards will facilitate greater use of technologies that can help ensure products are moved correctly and efficiently throughout the supply chain. 
Industrywide, global adoption of GS1 standards are 
important building blocks in securing the supply chain. 
Baxter looks forward to expanding its implementation of the GS1 standards, furthering its product integrity efforts and driving greater security and efficiency in the delivery 
of Baxter’s products to healthcare providers and patients 
around the world.
Product Design and Packaging 
Over the last several years, Baxter has implemented several 
enhancements to product design and packaging to enable and expand product authentication and the ability to identify tampering. These measures include multiple levels of closure and packaging and the use of unique materials. Due to the openness of global trade and the increasing sophistication of counterfeiters, companies must vary their approaches and continue to evolve specific technologies or materials used.
Collaboration with Officials and Industry Partners
Baxter collaborates with regulatory and public health officials and industry experts to share intelligence, insights and experience regarding product integrity. Groups such as GS1, Pharmaceutical Cargo Security Coalition, Parenteral Drug Association and Rx360 have facilitated exchange of industry expertise and collaboration with regulatory authorities to develop and raise standards, drive voluntary adoption of new processes and technologies, and implement new measures to advance product integrity and protect patients and clinicians.
R&D AND DESIGN  GRI  4.8  4.11  
The research and development and design stages offer unique opportunities to shape a product’s sustainability performance across its life cycle. To address environmental, health and safety issues such as materials selection, energy use, and features that affect recyclability, Baxter conducts 
Product Sustainability Review  during the early stages of 
product development.
Baxter also has policies and programs to address a wide 
range of bioethics issues, from Animal Welfare and Clinical 
Trials  to the use of genetically modified organisms and 
the cloning and use of human embryos. The company’s 
Bioethics Policy  includes Baxter’s Bioethics Guiding Principles  
that address topics such as product safety and efficacy, stakeholder concerns, risk-benefit analysis, legal and regulatory compliance, vendor conformance to Baxter’s standards, clinical trials, animal welfare and biodiversity.
The company’s senior leadership team considers these 
principles in addition to the advice of scientific and ethical advisors to determine whether to proceed with research activities that have bioethical aspects. For such activities Product

Animal Welfare  GRI  4.8  4.12  
Baxter supports the conscientious use of animals in research only when no other acceptable scientific alternative exists to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the company’s life-saving and life-sustaining products and therapies. Baxter believes that it has an ethical responsibility to ensure the well-being and humane care of the animals it uses in product development and testing. In the substantial majority of cases where Baxter uses animal testing, it is required by health authorities to do so. 
The company is committed to using and developing 
alternative protocols, methodologies and models which reduce or replace the use of animals. Baxter also works to refine current test systems to either reduce animal use or improve animal welfare, while ensuring sound data are collected. For decades, the company has supported pre-clinical testing involving humane animal use that complies with all relevant local, national and transnational laws and regulations (as verified by regular inspections by the respective authorities/agencies) as well as additional voluntary 
guidelines .
Baxter’s Global Animal Welfare Committee
Baxter’s Global Animal Welfare Committee is composed of internal veterinary professionals whose goals are to enhance current programs and to identify and develop new opportunities to optimize animal welfare. The committee oversees standards of animal welfare across Baxter’s global operations and contract research organizations including academic institutions. 
The committee focuses on:
• Further developing and implementing programs that will 
advance the 3Rs (as described on the following page), and other animal use initiatives;• Encouraging the identification, investigation and validation of alternative test methods when opportunities exist and regulations permit;
• Setting universal standards of animal care and welfare; and  
• Reviewing Baxter’s animal use, animal welfare programs and related policies and standards. 
The committee provides ongoing assessment and support 
of Baxter’s animal testing programs to harmonize processes and tools globally. The committee’s recommendations are guided by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International’s system of program accreditation.

Replace, Reduce and Refine
Baxter is committed to enhancing animal welfare through the 
3Rs—replacement, reduction and refinement. The company applies a range of innovations in this area, including those described below.
Replacement
Baxter implements new technologies and processes to 
substitute animal with non-animal tests.
• When possible, Baxter utilizes its strength in analytical 
characterization of its materials as a means to assess toxicologic risk in lieu of animal testing.
• Baxter utilizes software to model structure-activity relationships, thereby using in silico methods when 
possible to obviate the need for animal testing.
Reduction
When Baxter is required to conduct animal testing, 
researchers use enhanced data collection and analysis methods to reduce overall animal use.
• For both new product development and established 
products, Baxter replaces animal safety testing with cell-based alternative in vitro methods where regulations will allow. In vitro test systems are being validated and registered, which will substantially reduce the use of animals for in-process and final product 
quality release tests.
• Baxter participates in the Extractables and Leachables 
Safety Information Exchange and utilizes other databases of test methods to share toxicity data to minimize the use of animals.Refinement
Baxter researchers work closely with other scientists 
and industry organizations to share best practices and demonstrate continual improvement. The company also supports organizations that aim to reduce the need for animal testing and promote animal welfare.
• Baxter continually places an emphasis study designs that 
maintain or increase the amount of information collected without increasing animal use.
• Baxter evaluates and ensures consistently high standards for all animal housing methods and enrichments.

PRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY  GRI  EN6  EN26  PR1 
A significant part of Baxter’s environmental footprint is 
embodied in the products it designs, manufactures and sells 
worldwide. Reducing these impacts has been a key focus for 
the company for many years. Baxter’s Product Sustainability Program—which builds on an extensive partnership with the R&D, marketing and supply chain groups—works to further embed product stewardship across Baxter.
The company is committed to continually improving the 
sustainability of its products. Doing so meets customers’ growing expectations and requirements, helps to address new and expanding regulations globally, responds to ongoing pressure from non-governmental organizations and other 
interested stakeholders, and decreases the company’s 
environmental impacts across the value chain. This requires a broad range of inputs and expertise, and the collaboration of people representing different teams and functions across the 
company (see graphic).
To fully consider environmental performance in product 
design, Baxter must understand the possible impacts of the 
decisions it makes across the life cycle. To achieve this, the 
company has adopted sophisticated analytical processes and 
tools, including Product Sustainability Review and life cycle 
assessment (LCA). 
Product Sustainability Review 
Product Sustainability Review (PSR)—also referred to as an 
environmental, health and safety (EHS) plan—provides the foundation for the company’s efforts in sustainable design. 
This required assessment occurs during the Design Control 
Methodology, which guides the product development 
process for all medical devices. PSR helps Baxter to fully consider and address EHS factors, such as materials 
selection, energy use and recyclability.Address Customer

The process includes identifying high-level sustainability 
risks and opportunities in areas such as laws and regulations 
and customer and other stakeholder requirements, as well 
as a comprehensive review that identifies improvement opportunities across the life cycle. This includes LCA-based 
computer modeling of proposed products, and may 
involve comparison to existing products. Designers use this assessment to inform material choices and evaluate product end-of-life options and other factors. Baxter uses these results 
to help establish product requirements and minimize potential 
product impacts to human health and the environment.
Since 2005, Baxter has used PSR to evaluate more than 20 
medical devices and currently has multiple devices under 
assessment. Several reviews have influenced materials 
selection to avoid chemicals of concern.

PSR also helps Baxter address compliance considerations 
for existing and upcoming product stewardship-related regulations, and the company periodically updates the PSR toxic chemicals screen to reflect changes in legislation, customer concerns, and other factors. This helps Baxter meet growing customer demands to limit these substances and address material restrictions under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Directive and other regulations worldwide. See 
Materials Use  for more information about Baxter’s approach 
related to product materials. 
Life Cycle Assessment
Supplementing PSR, Baxter also uses LCA to evaluate and improve the environmental performance of its products. This may include decreasing the presence of chemicals of concern 
and reducing life cycle water or energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or waste generation.
In 2014, Gambro (which Baxter acquired in September 2013) completed an LCA of CWP 800, a new water purification system used for dialysis. Minimizing electricity and water consumption in the use phase, which consists of system operation and water flow required for dialysis, has the largest potential for improving environmental performance and was a focus during product development. For example, the use phase represents about 70–80% of total life cycle potential impact on climate change, depending on which of two use 
cases is assessed (see graph). Production represents most 
of the remainder, with insubstantial contributions from transport and end-of-life. The LCA will be used to create an Environmental Product Declaration (Type II) for the CWP 800 system, which the company plans to publish during 2015. 
In 2014, Baxter worked with graduate students from the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison to develop a methodology to assess carbon reduction strategies for Baxter’s Renal Therapy Services (RTS)
1 in Colombia. The study provided 
several approaches to analyze and prioritize carbon reduction options in four areas—energy efficiency, on-site renewable energy generation, transportation and carbon offsetting—based on impact and cost-effectiveness. The scope of the analysis included manufacturing (including employee commuting); product distribution to warehouses, clinics and patient homes; service delivery at clinics or homes (including patient travel); additional energy use required at clinics and emissions from waste transportation and disposal. A carbon footprint estimate showed that manufacturing is the largest contributor to overall GHG emissions, followed by service delivery and then product distribution.

The team also demonstrated various approaches that RTS 
can use to prioritize carbon reduction opportunities across the value chain. These included using lean analysis to identify inefficient facilities, comparing the feasibility of wind versus solar energy, assessing transportation best practices and analyzing the cost effectiveness of carbon offsetting. Moving forward the team plans to complete an LCA of RTS in Colombia.
In 2013, Baxter conducted an internal LCA of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) using the company’s HomeChoice cycler, which performs treatment overnight. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) treats end-stage renal disease, or kidney failure by removing waste, toxins and fluids from a patient’s kidneys inside his or her body using the body’s natural filter called the peritoneal membrane. The study assessed impacts across the life cycle related to consumables (raw materials and manufacturing), distribution to patients at 
home, cycler electricity use, patient travel for monthly doctor 
visits, and disposal of consumables. The results showed that 
consumables were the most significant contributor to overall 
impacts, regardless of the prescription scenario or the type of environmental impact assessed, representing 73% of total energy use, 66% of GHG emissions and 79% of water use.
Baxter is pursuing LCAs of several additional products 
 
during 2015.
Stakeholder Engagement on Product Environmental 
Performance  GRI  4.16  4.17
Customers, purchasing organizations and governments in 
most European countries and in the United States (especially in California) increasingly require product environmental performance information in requests for proposal and consider that information in vendor selection. A standard environmental questionnaire used by several purchasing organizations in the United States potentially influences a substantial amount of procurement annually across the healthcare sector. Similarly, many governments worldwide 
set environmental criteria for “greener” public procurement. Throughout Europe, EHS-related questions represent, on 
average, 5% of the total weighting of tenders that Baxter receives. 
To address specific questions that customers might have 
about materials, Baxter also provides access to a searchable database of 
Safety Data Sheets  for all relevant products,  
in multiple languages.
Reflecting the sizable environmental impacts of the healthcare  
sector and the complexity of issues in this area, Baxter promotes improved performance across the industry. The company works with customers, industry peers and other organizations to address challenges such as the recycling 
 
and responsible treatment of disposable medical products. 
Examples of engagement during 2014 included:
• Coalition for Sustainable Pharmaceuticals and Medical 
Devices (CSPM)    Baxter is a founding member of this 
working group of leading healthcare companies. In 
collaboration with NHS England, CSPM strives to advance 
more sustainable healthcare products and services by 
promoting best practice and developing sustainability tools and guidelines to reduce product environmental impact. During the year, Baxter co-developed and signed on to a 
joint statement  for the U.N. Climate Summit. This document 
describes the organization’s commitment to developing more sustainable healthcare products and practices, and 
outlines several metrics it will use to measure success.
• Healthcare Plastics Recycling Council (HPRC)    
Baxter helped develop tools to support hospital  
recycling programs and attended a Hospital Roundtable 
focused on that issue at Stanford Hospital and Clinics with several California hospitals. See 
Product End-of-Life  
for more detail. 
• Practice Greenhealth   Baxter participated in the Greening 
the Operating Room symposium  sponsored by this 
organization. The event promoted environmentally-friendly practices in the operating room and explored innovative 
approaches to ongoing improvement in this area. Product

• Product Sustainability Round Table    Baxter joined this 
organization, convened by PE International, through which 
members benchmark performance and share experiences, perspectives and insights about key sustainability trends and emerging issues.
• State Waste Services   Baxter Australia signed a three-
year partnership agreement with State Waste Services 
to promote and provide PVC recycling to all hospitals 
throughout New South Wales. This builds on a partnership that Baxter established in 2013 with the Vinyl Council of Australia (VCA).
MATERIALS USE  GRI  EN26  4.11
Bureau Veritas has provided assurance on the content 
in this section.
Materials use is a key driver of Baxter’s environmental 
footprint, so decisions about material types and quantities are an important focus for the company. Baxter carefully considers the potential impacts of the materials it uses in its products and packaging and takes a disciplined approach 
 
to identifying materials for possible restriction.
Using materials efficiently is also a priority. Plastic scrap  
from manufacturing is the company’s largest waste stream, 
so reducing plastic waste and increasing recycling is 
essential. During 2014, Baxter reduced plastic scrap per  
unit of production by 13%, compared with 2011, at 20 
sites, which represent about 85% of the company’s overall 
plastic volume. For its electronic products, Baxter works to maximize 
product service life, reuse and recycling  as 
appropriate. The company also strives to optimize packaging and implemented projects that reduced total packaging 
 
by nearly 530 metric tons in 2014 on an annualized basis1  
(see Packaging  for details).
Customers, governments and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on the materials and chemical substances used in products and packaging. In some 
countries, legislation restricts the use of specific substances in products ( see Materials Restrictions ). Customers are also 
interested in the use of recycled and recyclable materials, such as in packaging.
Product Design and Materials Innovation 
Baxter works to ensure that new products meet robust 
environmental design principles, comply with environmental 
regulations and satisfy customer requirements. The 
company uses PSR for all new medical devices, to assess environmental, health and safety impacts across the product life cycle. For example, new electrical and electronic devices are designed to meet the European Union (EU) Restriction 
on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive guidelines. 
Based on available information, all devices are screened  
for the presence of chemicals from the REACH Regulation list of “Substances of Very High Concern” (SVHCs) and those are considered for elimination. Baxter also uses life cycle assessment to evaluate product environmental performance and determine ways to reduce product environmental footprint, including related to materials use. See 
Product 
Sustainability  for more detail.
To meet the preferences of some customers and address drug compatibility issues in specific clinical applications, Baxter continues to identify materials that meet the unique and evolving technical, design, regulatory, clinical and commercial requirements of individual product lines and markets. The company’s research team, headed by world-leading experts in plastics technology, considers the distinct characteristics of the solutions to be held in the containers, the performance characteristics required, scientific data supporting safe use, regulatory requirements, environmental impact and other aspects.

Materials Reporting and Restrictions
The EU RoHS2 Directive seeks to phase out the use of lead, 
mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium and brominated flame retardants in electronic products, including medical devices. Since July 2014, new medical devices that contain those substances above certain thresholds
1 cannot be 
placed on the EU market. Furthermore, countries such as China, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and some U.S. states, such as California, have proposed or enacted similar legislation. Baxter follows a global strategy to respond to these regulations worldwide and is planning to expand use of RoHS2-compliant products in other markets globally.
Baxter is also working to ensure it meets the EU REACH Regulation, which requires chemical suppliers, manufacturers or importers of more than one metric ton of a chemical substance in a given year to register the substance with the European Chemical Agency. The regulation expands significantly the number of substances that will require authorization for use, identifies SVHCs 
 
that may face future restrictions and requires companies to inform customers about the presence
2 of those substances 
in products. Baxter has registered all required substances and preparations following the regulation. The company’s cross-functional REACH team oversees Baxter’s ongoing response and explores further opportunities to eliminate hazardous substances. 
Customers and governmental regulations increasingly require companies to disclose information about materials and chemical substances used in products and manufacturing. Tracking and reporting this data is complex given the number and evolution of these standards and 
because some products contain components from numerous 
suppliers worldwide.
Baxter is implementing a global project to determine and assess the material and chemical content of substances and parts purchased for use in Baxter products. The company uses this to understand what key chemicals of concern are present and to meet global regulations, such as the RoHS2 Directive and REACH Regulation. Through ongoing work with suppliers, the company has identified the presence of SVHCs in some components and improved its understanding of which suppliers and components may pose a higher risk in this regard. Ensuring compliance requires ongoing expansion of supplier engagement, working with new suppliers and potentially modifying product designs.
Baxter also focuses on due diligence, training and reporting 
related to tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold originating from the 
Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries . See 
Baxter’s Conflict Minerals Report  and Supplier Standards  for 
more detail.
In addition to materials restricted by regulations, the company  
is also gathering information about substances such as bisphenol-A (BPA) and latex, which are of interest to some customers.
MANUFACTURING  GRI  EN26
The company has extensive EHS programs to minimize environmental impacts and ensure employee safety at its facilities globally.
Baxter generally requires third-party certification to the ISO 
14001 Environmental Management System Standard for the company’s manufacturing and research and development sites, and distribution sites with a capacity of at least 10,000 filled pallets or a workforce of 100 or more people. Sites that have achieved third-party ISO 14001 certification generally also pursue third-party Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001 certification, which helps improve a facility’s health and safety programs. As of year-end 2014, 79 Baxter locations have met the requirements of 
1 As defined by the RoHS2 Directive, maximum concentrations allowed are 0.1% by 
weight of homogeneous material for all substances except for cadmium which is restricted to 0.01% by weight.

Baxter also influences its suppliers’ manufacturing and other operational practices through the company’s Global Supplier Sustainability Program as well as its Supplier Quality Standard 
and Ethics and Compliance Standards for Baxter Suppliers. See 
Supply Chain  for more detail about Baxter’s activities in this area.
PACKAGING  GRI  EN26
Baxter works to decrease the environmental impact of packaging by reducing the amount used and substituting for environmentally-preferable materials. The company implemented projects in 2014 that reduced total packaging on an annualized basis by nearly 530 metric tons. Total annualized savings since 2007 equal 5,880 metric tons, exceeding Baxter’s goal to eliminate 5,000 metric tons of packaging material from products sent to customers by 2015.
1
For example, during 2014, Baxter’s Manesar, India, facility completed a project that saved 30 metric tons of packaging material on an annualized basis. The site reduced the bag weight on PD products by 7%. Baxter’s facility in Cali, Colombia, completed several projects that reduced total packaging on an annualized basis by 216 metric tons. One project replaced the cardboard partition cushioning system with one using polyethylene bubbles filled with air, saving 128 metric tons of packaging material on an annualized basis. 
Baxter’s facility in São Paulo, Brazil, reduced the thickness 
of the IV solutions bags it produces by 10%, thus decreasing packaging by 260 metric tons on an annualized basis.PRODUCT USE   GRI  4.12  PR3  PR6
Advertising and Promotion
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other governmental agencies worldwide regulate the advertising and promotion of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and biologics. The FDA’s oversight includes print and broadcast advertising, websites, press releases, sales brochures, convention booths and other promotional materials and activities.
Baxter’s Advertising and Promotion staff manage the company’s compliance with promotional regulations worldwide, reviewing marketing materials for accuracy and balance regarding presentation of product risks and benefits. The company’s approach takes into account regulations and standards which vary by region:
• Asia Pacific   
Baxter uses an electronic approval system 
that enables the company to comply with advertising 
and promotion codes, regulations and internal standards 
in 18 countries.
• Canada   Baxter’s advertising and promotion 
standards incorporate industry best practices following 
Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board guidelines 
and are reviewed for compliance to Health Canada regulations.
• Europe   Baxter ensures that marketing materials for 
distribution in the region comply with applicable laws and regulations as well as with the 
European Federation of 
Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations Code of Practice 
on the Promotion of Prescription-only Medicines to, and 
Interactions with, Healthcare Professionals . The company 
reviews marketing materials at the pan-European level, as 
well as at the country level for compliance with national 
product licenses and local codes of practice. Baxter also adheres to the 
EUCOMED Code of Ethical Business Practice , 
which covers medical devices.

PRODUCT END-OF-LIFE   GRI  EN26  EN27
Bureau Veritas has provided assurance on the content 
in this section.
The responsible treatment of healthcare products after 
customer use is an increasingly important issue worldwide. The appropriate approach varies by type of product, so Baxter has a range of initiatives. For example, some of the electronic medical devices Baxter sells, such as renal APD cyclers, are well suited to repair and reuse after the original customer has finished using them (see below). Many of the company’s other products, such as IV bags, cannot be reused due to regulatory, quality and safety reasons. 
However, they may be recycled responsibly to recover 
energy and materials for other uses.
Electronic Products 
In some countries, Baxter leases most of its electronic 
medical products to customers, which helps ensure they will be returned to Baxter after a set period of time. As appropriate, the company repairs those products for reuse, which extends their useful life and decreases the environmental impacts of product disposal and new 
product manufacture.At times, reuse is not feasible, and regulations in many countries worldwide require responsible recycling. For example, the European Union (EU) Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires manufacturers to arrange for the take-back of electronic products at end-of-life. This regulation impacts certain Baxter products in the EU such as dialysis machines, IV pumps and other electronic devices. In 2014, approximately 43 metric tons of electronic products and batteries were 
recovered in the region on Baxter’s behalf.
Baxter’s 
WEEE website  provides customers detailed 
information on WEEE and how to dispose of Baxter products in 
accordance with the Directive, in each of the EU Member States.
When customers return products to Baxter that contain 
batteries, or when Baxter repairs those products on-site, Baxter sends the batteries to a recycler when feasible, or otherwise provides for responsible disposal.
Disposable Medical Waste
Baxter works with customers, industry peers and recycling and disposal vendors to facilitate the recycling and responsible treatment of disposable medical products. The company belongs to the HPRC, an alliance of global healthcare companies focused on the recycling of plastic products used in hospitals. Baxter was one of 11 companies involved with HPRC to develop the 
Design Guidelines for 
Optimal Hospital Plastics Recycling , primarily intended for 
product designers and users of disposable medical devices. During 2014, a team led by Baxter developed guidance for optimizing and managing receiving dock space (which is typically under high demand in hospitals) to support recycling programs. This tool covers aspects such as defining a program’s scope, clarifying logistics with recycling vendors, assessing which space best suits program needs and determining how to effectively manage materials to be 
recycled. HPRC plans to publish this information in 2015, as 
a part of its 
HospiCycle guide , developed to help hospitals 
successfully implement recycling practices. Product

Through HPRC, Baxter participated in a Hospital Roundtable 
hosted by Stanford Hospital and Clinics during the year, focused on hospital plastic recycling programs. The company gained insights on the types and effectiveness of plastic recycling programs in place at several participating California hospitals and learned what additional information and tools would help to increase the success of those initiatives. 
Baxter continues to seek other opportunities to partner with 
healthcare organizations, waste management and recycling 
firms to test the economic and logistical feasibility of more efficient management of wastes generated from Baxter and other healthcare products.
In 2014, Baxter Australia signed a three-year partnership agreement with State Waste Services (SWS) to promote and provide PVC recycling to all hospitals throughout New South Wales (NSW). SWS will offer PVC recycling services anywhere in the state, at a greater than 35% discount 
compared with disposing of PVC among general waste. Baxter will support the program by providing hospitals with bins, brochures and staff education.
“This is a significant development and competitive advantage 
for our reputation, as we will now be offering every NSW hospital customer this recycling program and delivering real value to the health system,” said David Akeroyd, Managing Director, Baxter Australia New Zealand.
This builds on the partnership that Baxter established in 2013 with the Vinyl Council of Australia (VCA) to launch the VCA’s PVC Recovery in Hospitals initiative in Australia.
 
During 2014, the initiative grew rapidly, reaching 32 hospitals in Australia as well as 3 in New Zealand, which together have the potential to recycle 70 metric tons of PVC during 2015. See 
Case Study: Baxter Australia Partners in Hospital Waste 
Recycling Program  for historical information. 
Baxter is also helping patients who receive regular home deliveries of dialysis solutions in Australia to recycle related waste. As of the end of 2014, more than 250 Baxter PD home patients participated in the Home PD Recycling Program, which collects and recycles more than 4 metric tons of plastic and 2 metric tons of cardboard each month from patients in 11 participating Renal units.
Global Waste Site Audit Program
Baxter’s global audit program covers all regulated or medical waste recycling or disposal sites that the company 
uses for waste generated internally. Before using a 
medical waste recycling or disposal vendor, trained Baxter auditors assess the vendor for compliance with Baxter’s requirements. Repeat audits are then conducted at least once every four years. These audits examine all aspects of operations, including site history, regulatory compliance, financial conditions, insurance and other factors. Product

SUPPLIER STANDARDS   GRI  3.9  4.8  4.12  HR2
Several sustainability-related standards govern Baxter’s 
relationships with suppliers and serve as the foundation for the company’s Global Supplier Sustainability Program. Baxter maintains a culture of strict compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and the highest standards of ethics and business conduct. This extends to the company’s relationships with suppliers.
The following standards provide a framework for consistent 
supplier evaluation, approval and selection, and define 
policies and expectations for ethical behavior when doing business with Baxter. 
• The Supplier Quality Standard  addresses sustainability 
issues, including child labor, employment standards, 
waste and energy reduction, materials of concern and supply chain due diligence and ethics. 
• Baxter’s 
Ethics and Compliance Standards for Baxter 
Suppliers , available in 19 languages and included with 
supplier agreements, covers areas such as child labor, confidential information, intellectual property, gifts and entertainment, anticorruption, conflicts of interest, trade compliance, fair employment opportunities and environment, health and safety. 
• Baxter’s 
Conflict Minerals position statement  addresses 
the company’s goal to source raw materials that  
require the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold from conflict-free sources.
Baxter does not tolerate any form of forced labor or human 
trafficking and slavery in its operations or supply chain. The company works to ensure that suppliers operate ethically and do not engage in these practices. (See Baxter’s 
statement  in response 
to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010.)
The company requires all suppliers to comply with these standards and expectations as well as all laws governing purchasing, and may terminate agreements with suppliers that do not. To support these efforts, employees in Baxter’s Purchasing and Supplier Management (PSM) organization complete mandatory ethics training. All PSM employees that interact with suppliers must take an online ethics and compliance course as well as a live training session conducted by Baxter’s Ethics and Compliance organization. 
To ensure Baxter maintains a continuous supply of vital raw 
materials used in its products, the company also asks key suppliers to provide emergency response plans describing how they will respond in the event of a catastrophe or other business interruptions. 
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative 
Baxter believes that it can enhance its influence and improve efficiency through collaboration with other members of the healthcare industry to advance responsible procurement and sustainability. In 2013, Baxter joined the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), a healthcare industry group focused on responsible procurement, risk mitigation and supplier capacity building. 
PSCI has developed a code covering ethics, labor, safety, 
environmental and management systems standards and 
expectations for suppliers to the healthcare industry. PSCI’s independent auditor and audit committee review the audit results and monitor the subsequent supplier corrective and preventive actions implemented. Baxter encourages its suppliers to participate in the PSCI audit program. 
Additionally, Baxter supports the PSCI supplier capability 
building committee, which creates information resources and training to help suppliers advance responsible procurement. During 2014, PSCI provided introductory trainings on responsible procurement. PSCI is also exploring additional supplier training opportunities, in areas such as safety, that can be tailored to specific country or regional needs.Supply Chain

Product Material Regulatory Compliance 
Customers and governmental regulations increasingly require 
companies to disclose information about materials and chemical substances used in products and manufacturing. Tracking this information is complex since some of Baxter’s products, such as infusion pumps and dialysis machines, may contain components from numerous suppliers worldwide. Baxter’s suppliers play a critical role in helping the company assess material compliance risk. The 
Materials Use  section of 
this report provides more information about Baxter’s initiatives.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires companies that file annual reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to indicate if their products contain tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. See Baxter’s 
Conflict Minerals Report . 
In 2014, in addition to peforming due diligence on its  
global suppliers consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guidelines for Conducting Due Diligence on Minerals from Conflict-Affected Areas, Baxter posted its 
Conflict Minerals position 
statement  to address the company’s goal to source raw 
materials that require the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold from conflict-free sources. Baxter also updated its supplier quality standards, purchase order terms and conditions and other procurement practices to address conflict mineral risk. In 2014, the company provided training to the Gambro purchasing team on conflict minerals compliance and launched an online page of guidance for 
 
its suppliers. 
U.S. Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism 
(C-TPAT) Program 
As a manufacturer, Baxter is also a supplier to other 
companies, and works to ensure it meets the highest standards of 
ethics and business conduct . Baxter’s efforts 
to establish a secure supply chain for its raw materials and shipments of products from suppliers and customers, such as through the C-TPAT Program, support a secure supply of life-saving medical products. C-TPAT is a joint 
U.S. government-business initiative that builds cooperative 
relationships to enhance U.S. border security, with a focus 
on strengthening security throughout the supply chain. As an importer, Baxter has been recognized as a Tier III Partner (the highest level an importer can achieve) in the U.S. C-TPAT Program since 2011. As of 2015, about 3% of the nearly 11,000 
program participants had achieved this status. Baxter’s 
internal C-TPAT steering committee remains committed to monitoring and enhancing its supply chain practices and implementing process improvements as needed.
Additionally, the company was an early adopter of GS1 
standards, which are used to uniquely identify all products, trade items, logistic units, locations, assets and relationships in the supply chain—from manufacturer to consumers. See 
Product Integrity  for more information.
SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT   GRI  3.9  EN26  HR2
Baxter considers several environmental and social factors as it integrates sustainable practices into procurement. The company collaborates with its suppliers to identify opportunities to 
improve environmental performance, such as reducing energy 
use, GHG emissions and waste. Baxter also promotes human rights throughout its supplier base. 
Requests for Proposal and Supplier Agreements 
Baxter considers price, quality, environmental criteria and other factors when selecting and evaluating its suppliers. To support 
these efforts, the company incorporates sustainability in 
requests for proposal (RFPs) and supplier contract templates globally. This reiterates Baxter’s commitment and provides a means to assess each supplier’s ability to support progress against Baxter’s sustainability goals and conduct business 
consistent with Baxter’s supplier standards.

engaging their own suppliers. See 
Supplier Diversity  for more 
information about Baxter’s efforts in this area.
The agreement also encourages suppliers to identify products 
and/or services for Baxter’s use with reduced environmental impact. Baxter asks its suppliers to provide regular updates on 
their sustainability activities.
Annual Supplier Sustainability Survey 
From 2009 until 2013, Baxter surveyed its significant suppliers 
annually about their environmental, safety, ethics, human 
rights and other sustainability-related programs and progress. 
The company used responses to identify opportunities 
for best practice sharing and collaboration to improve 
performance. To encourage honest and accurate disclosure, supplier responses did not impact current or future contracts. 
In 2014, Baxter shared each supplier’s responses with the 
Baxter purchasing employee responsible for the relationship. This enabled the relationship manager to incorporate this information into regular supplier meetings to verify 
responses, discuss gaps and identify opportunities for further 
collaboration. Baxter is also using aggregated results to determine focus areas for additional training or collaboration, 
which can be tailored by region. While suppliers are ultimately 
accountable for their performance, Baxter will engage and influence where it can to advance the sustainability of its 
supply base, as an extension of its sourcing and operations sustainability and, ultimately, product responsibility.
Due to the planned separation of Baxter into two companies in 
 
2015, Baxter did not conduct the supplier sustainability survey 
during 2014. Future plans for this program remain to be determined.
Recognizing Supplier Environmental Efforts
During 2014, Baxter’s e-Impact program continued to identify 
opportunities to collaborate with suppliers to improve 
environmental performance and to recognize results. To 
acknowledge successful projects, Baxter leaders award both 
the supplier and the relevant Baxter employees with an 
electronic certificate of appreciation. Employees submitted 49 ideas for projects in 2014. Of these, 17 initiatives were 
successfully completed during the year, with combined 
benefits to Baxter and its suppliers summarized below.
For example, based on an e-Impact submission, in 2014, Baxter’s Jayuya and Guayama, Puerto Rico, facilities 
converted from using heavy fuel oil in boilers to using lower 
carbon natural gas in the form of liquid propane. Also based 
on a submission, in 2013, Baxter’s Neuchâtel, Switzerland, 
facility installed an on-site, roof-mounted solar photovoltaic system and entered into an agreement to procure electricity 
generated from 100% renewable power from a local electricity 
provider. As a result, all of the electricity used by Neuchâtel, 
 
is now generated from 100% renewable power. Combined Results of e-Impact Projects

PRODUCT TRANSPORT   GRI  EN18  EN26  EN29
Baxter transports large amounts of raw materials and 
more than 100 million cases of finished products each year 
throughout the company’s global supply chain. In some instances, Baxter directly operates its product distribution 
system. For example, the company manages its own 
private fleet for Renal product home delivery in certain countries. In other cases, the company partners with 
 
third-party vendors and carriers.
Baxter estimates GHG emissions  for upstream and 
downstream product transportation and distribution. The 
company’s approach to improving performance in this 
area includes:
• Optimizing the distribution network
• Using intermodal transport
• Increasing capacity utilization
• Engaging in environmentally responsible partnerships
• Implementing pallet recovery and waste minimization efforts
Performance in 2014
Baxter formed its first Global Transportation Council in 
early 2015 to create a strategic road map for product transport globally. The Council will create goals and plans, 
share internal and external best practices, serve as a point 
of accountability globally, and provide the tools to further improve product transportation at the company.  
During 2014, Baxter continued to refine a system to track 
GHG emissions from product transport worldwide. The company again worked with UPS
® and The CarbonNeutral 
Company to determine its worldwide transportation-related GHG emissions by truck, rail, air and ocean. 
Baxter’s total worldwide GHG emissions from product transport  
equaled 490,500 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
2e) in 2014, equivalent to 128 kilograms CO2e per metric 
ton of products transported, the same rate as in 2013.Supply Chain

Optimizing the Distribution Network
To decrease product transport distance, environmental 
impact and cost, Baxter identifies opportunities to  
ship products to customers from local manufacturing facilities when possible. For example, the company’s customers in Poland had previously received products from Baxter’s manufacturing facilities in Western Europe via the company’s distribution facility in Belgium. In 2012, Baxter began to manufacture and distribute certain products from its manufacturing facility in Poland directly to local customers.
In its largest U.S. replenishment center, Baxter deployed a new application that assists transportation planners to maximize the total weight of a truckload. The tool suggests an optimal product mix and loading pattern to increase total truckload weight, while not exceeding legal weight limits. Baxter is deploying this application in other replenishment centers.
Intermodal Transport
Different modes of transport—such as air, ocean, river barges, trucks and rail—have varying levels of fuel intensity and environmental impact. Using intermodal transport, which combines multiple modes for a single shipment, can decrease costs and reduce overall GHG emissions. 
Baxter continues to use this approach in Europe and 
the United States when possible. For example, shipping 
containers are moved from manufacturing plants by 
truck, transferred to more efficient and cost-effective rail or barge transport for longer distances, and then shifted 
back to truck for final delivery. Baxter used intermodal transport for approximately 20% of its shipments to replenish the company’s U.S distribution network in 2014.Capacity Utilization 
Baxter also improves transport efficiency by increasing 
capacity utilization. For example, use of double-decker 
trucks to replenish distribution centers across Europe  
has enabled Baxter to transport loads in two trucks  
that have historically required three, reducing overall  
GHG emissions. Another way to advance capacity 
utilization is through cooperation agreements with others 
to share routes and trucks to move combined loads  
most efficiently. 
In the United States, Baxter is collaborating with other 
companies to co-load shipments to reduce GHG emissions 
and costs. For example, Baxter is partnering with a major 
beverage manufacturer’s transport division to utilize  
their equipment with Baxter’s. Since the products are of similar densities, this will help maximize usage of fully 
loaded trailers.
Environmentally Responsible Partnerships
Baxter is one of a select number of companies that participate in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) SmartWay program as both a Carrier and Shipper 
Partner. SmartWay is a partnership between the U.S. EPA 
and industry to reduce air pollution and GHG emissions through cleaner, more fuel-efficient product transport. Supply Chain

with its U.S. Renal truck fleet, recognizing the 
company’s “outstanding” commitment to using 
commercially available fuel-saving options and 
evaluating emerging technologies that help reduce its 
fleet’s environmental impact. 
Besides the company’s own Renal fleet, Baxter works 
with shipping carriers to deliver other products. In 2011, Baxter’s operations in the United States also became a SmartWay Partnership Shipper. Since 2009, the 
company requires all of its carriers in the United States to be SmartWay members. In 2013, Baxter’s operations in Canada also 
became a SmartWay Partnership Shipper.
Pallet Recovery and Waste Minimization Efforts
Pallets are used to consolidate cases of products for transport and to move products within Baxter facilities. The company works to use pallets more efficiently to save materials and cost. In some locations, Baxter uses reusable plastic pallets in a “closed loop” system or in returnable totes.
In other countries, including Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, teams work to optimize the used wooden pallets, and recycle them when feasible. In Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, pallet recovery programs refurbish pallets for reuse. 
Baxter continues to reduce the environmental impact of its warehouse and distribution facilities. For example, the company added a dock tunnel and quick door into its loading bay at its facility in Italy. This allows less energy to escape while Baxter loads product from the facility onto a truck for delivery.SUPPLIER DIVERSITY   GRI  EC6
Baxter works to develop mutually beneficial relationships 
with small and diverse suppliers, and strives to continue 
to increase the diversity of its supplier base. The company 
increased its spend with small suppliers in the United States and Puerto Rico to nearly $504 million in 2014, 19% more than in 2013. 
Small and diverse suppliers offer many advantages. Small suppliers are often more agile than larger companies and 
have an entrepreneurial outlook that can foster creativity 
and collaboration. Baxter’s patient and customer base is 
increasingly diverse, and using diverse suppliers helps the 
company to better meet their varied needs. Additionally, Baxter’s use of local and diverse suppliers contributes to economic stability in local communities. Sourcing locally also helps Baxter reduce its transport-related environmental impacts. 
Baxter works to keep supplier diversity prominent 
throughout the supplier bidding and contracting process. For example, in addition to RFPs, Baxter includes supplier diversity information in its supplier agreement summary sheets approved by senior management. These checklists include questions such as: How many diverse suppliers 
were included in the selection process? What classification 
were those suppliers? Was the selected supplier diverse? 
 
If not, why? 
To increase the visibility of diverse suppliers prior to initiating RFPs, the company plans to become more involved in diverse supplier forums and fairs to help Baxter purchasers become acquainted with these suppliers prior to a bid process. In addition, Baxter plans to focus on developing both second and third tier relationships throughout its supply base. Baxter is working to create a robust, diverse supplier registration portal to enable small and diverse 91      BAXTER 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

works to establish international supplier diversity programs.  
The company is also a corporate partner of the Women’s Business Development Center. 
Baxter is exploring possibilities to grow its supplier diversity program from a U.S.-based effort into a global one. In 2014, Baxter signed the Charter of Diversity in Austria, an initiative by the Austrian Chamber of Commerce for private and public corporations, organizations and institutions to publically disclose their efforts to engage in inclusion and diversity business networking in that country.

Access to Healthcare    GRI  EC8
Improving access to healthcare is a global challenge. This issue is especially pressing in developing 
countries, where infrastructure, political instability, poverty, levels of education, regulatory restrictions, and inadequate availability and affordability of medical products can all limit access. Developing solutions requires cooperation among governments, non-governmental organizations, corporations, medical professionals and others.
Baxter produces life-saving and life-sustaining products and therapies in the form of biologics, devices and specialized pharmaceuticals (such as intravenous solutions and anesthetic agents) that are typically administered in a hospital or clinical setting. The company collaborates with government partners to expand access to quality care, while improving health outcomes and controlling costs.

The following graphic illustrates Baxter’s broad approach  
in this area.
ADVANCING PUBLIC HEALTH   GRI  LA8
Baxter supports initiatives that expand availability of 
its treatments, and the company collaborates with 
other organizations to advance public health. This 
includes education to better inform current and future patients around the world, as well as training to increase 
the capabilities of physicians and other healthcare 
professionals. The company also enters into public-private  
partnerships to share best practices in manufacturing and treatment. Additionally, Baxter collaborates with governments, companies and other organizations to influence policy and standards that promote patient access to therapy and products. 
Following are some examples of Baxter’s recent efforts to advance public health in the areas of hemophilia, immune
 
disorders, renal disease and compounded medications.Improving Care for Hemophilia Patients
As a leading manufacturer of hemophilia products, Baxter is committed to improving patient treatment and care. For example, through its Bilingual Healthcare Educators program in the United States, Baxter offers support for Spanish-speaking hemophilia patients and their families, as well as educational events and resources on topics such as hemophilia basics, accessing care in the emergency room and keeping joints healthy. See 
Case Study: Families Touched 
by Hemophilia Receive Much-Needed Support in Spanish .
To provide hemophilia patients with greater access to recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment, Baxter entered into an exclusive 20-year partnership in 2012 with 
Hemobrás  
(Empresa Brasileira de Hemoderivados e Biotechnologia). Through this partnership, Baxter will be the sole supplier of Brazil’s recombinant FVIII treatment during the first 10 years of the initiative while the companies collaborate on technology transfer to support development of local manufacturing capacity. It is estimated that more than 
10,000 people in Brazil are living with hemophilia A, and 
today the vast majority are treated with plasma-derived factor VIII.
1  In 2014, nearly 4,000 patients in Brazil were 
converted from plasma factor VIII to recombinant factor VIII, adding to the more than 3,000 patients already undergoing prophylactic recombinant factor VIII treatment. 
The company also works to provide medical professionals 
with educational opportunities to help pursue a bleed-free world. Baxter launched the first hemophilia multidisciplinary community in Latin America in 2014, aimed at developing 
an educational group for healthcare providers. The 
initiative, called ALAS Hemostatis, consists of Centers of Excellence, the ALAS Expert Working Group, the website 
ALASHemostasis.com , and international facility tours.  Baxter’s

During their first ALAS Hemostasis Expert Working Group 
meeting, the group discussed current hemophilia care levels and the potential establishment of principles of care similar to 
those in Europe. The group plans to meet three times in 2015. 
Baxter also donated more than $2.3 million worth of 
recombinant factor VIII treatment to the China Children and Teenagers’ Fund from 2013 to 2015, which will be used 
by children under 18 years old with moderate to severe 
hemophilia A who come from a low income background. This is in addition to more than five million international units of recombinant factor VIII product that Baxter China had already donated. 
Expanding Access to Plasma-Derived Therapies
It is estimated that 160,000 Brazilians suffer from a primary immunodeficiency (PI), although only 4,000 have been diagnosed. In November 2014, Baxter, PI patient associations 
and healthcare professionals, along with a congressman 
in Brazil, attended a public hearing in the Brazilian Parliament. Their purpose was to promote early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the disease and to request an 
update to the Ministry of Health’s guidelines regarding PI 
therapies. As a result of the public hearing, the congressman offered to endorse a Bill of Law based on a letter of demands drafted by the speakers. Four congressmen have committed to signing the bill and supporting the patients. Baxter was 
a supporter of this initiative that will bring better treatment 
and care for PI patients in the country.
In 2014, Stichting Sanquin Bloedvoorziening (Sanquin Blood 
Supply Foundation)  began to process plasma supplied 
by Baxter into bulk material for Baxter’s plasma-derived therapies used to treat immune disorders, hemophilia, 
trauma and other critical health conditions. Two years 
earlier, Baxter had entered into a 10-year manufacturing services agreement with Sanquin to provide additional plasma fractionation capacity in support of global demand 
for Baxter’s plasma-derived therapies.
 Sharing Best Practices for End-Stage Renal Disease 
Treatment
The program “Flying Angel,” a partnership between 
Baxter China and the Chinese National Institute of 
Hospital Administration under the National Health and 
Family Planning Commission (former Ministry of Health), 
has been developing and deploying a sustainable peritoneal dialysis (PD) care and delivery model for 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients living in rural parts of the country. See 
Case Study: Improving Access to 
Renal Therapy in China .  
Baxter has also advanced construction on a new PD manufacturing facility in Thailand, which will support 
increased demand and access to care under Thailand’s 
“PD First” policy. This policy, in place since 2008, 
encourages PD as the first-line dialysis treatment option, 
when appropriate, for new ESRD patients. The facility 
is expected to start commercial production in the first quarter of 2016.
In 2014, Baxter supported the launch of the 
Federación 
Mexicana de Enfermos y Trasplantados Renales, A.C.  
(FEMETRE), which provides a unified voice for renal 
patients in the country. An estimated 9.5 million people in Mexico suffer from chronic renal disease, and approximately 129,000 are in phase IV or V and require 
dialysis or transplant. As only roughly 60% of the renal 
disease patient population has access to the appropriate treatment, FEMETRE seeks to provide universal access to timely treatment through support and awareness, as well as advocacy within the National Health System.
Also, in 2013, Baxter announced it would provide St. 
Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton, a hospital in Ontario, Canada, with $250,000 over five years to deliver chronic 
kidney disease patients with digital educational materials 
about treatment options. Access to

Expanding Access to Compounded Medications
Baxter recently entered into a public-private partnership 
with Changi General Hospital in Singapore to establish the Centre of Excellence in Compounding to share best practices within the larger compounding community as well as to innovate in care delivery models. The center will develop clinical protocols and care paths to enable the administration of compounded sterile solutions to certain patients at home, allowing them to avoid staying in the hospital for weeks and potentially reducing the possibility of hospital-acquired infections.
Investigator Initiated Research and Continuing  
Medical Education Grants
Baxter is committed to supporting investigator-initiated research and medical education to benefit healthcare practitioners and advance patient care worldwide. For example, Baxter BioScience provided the Jeffrey Modell Foundation a grant in 2014 to continue to research and lobby for the Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) Newborn Screening Program, which is now implemented in 32 of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the Navajo Nation covering 76.8% of babies born in the U.S. 
Babies with this condition left undiagnosed and untreated 
will generally not survive their first birthday. However, newborn screening for SCID enables these babies to be identified, diagnosed and cured with a stem cell transplant. 
All grant submissions are reviewed by a multidisciplinary 
team. Once accepted for further assessment, the proposal is evaluated on the basis of medical or scientific merit, potential clinical usefulness of the data expected to be generated by the study and alignment with Baxter’s existing or anticipated future product strategy and therapeutic area strategy. Baxter does not support research that is unnecessarily duplicative or a pretense to promote Baxter’s products. All grants comply with Baxter’s Global Policy on Interactions with the Medical Community and Government Officials. See 
Ethics and 
Compliance Structure and Programs .Addressing Product Shortages
The product shortages that have occurred across the 
industry in recent years have involved many factors, including raw material shortages, shifts in clinical practices, 
company decisions to discontinue specific medicines, supply 
disruptions from manufacturers which cause volatility 
in overall industry demand and supply, wholesaler and pharmacy inventory practices, changes in hospital and pharmacy contractual relationships with suppliers and wholesalers, adherence to protocols mandated by the FDA, natural disasters and manufacturing challenges. Drug shortages are complex problems that require broad-based solutions from all stakeholders. Baxter is committed to finding balanced solutions that involve stakeholders across the value chain.
Baxter’s extensive portfolio offers options for clinicians and patients to address their supply needs through similar products or drugs that are available in a slightly different format (e.g. a premix intravenous formulation of a drug versus an injectable format that is in short supply). The company has remained the one continual supplier for a number of critical products that have experienced supply disruption.
In a number of instances over the last few years, Baxter has quickly responded to help minimize customer impact of competitive disruptions in the supply of particular products and has sought to ensure patients continue to receive the life-sustaining therapies they needed. Read feature story, “
Baxter Facilities Go Above and Beyond in the Face of Mother 
Nature and Unprecedented Customer Demand .” In some 
situations, Baxter has increased production or temporarily shifted production capability to increase supply, has adjusted inventory and supply chain practices and prioritized clinical access to vital products on an equitable basis in order to meet critical patient needs, has worked closely with regulatory authorities to seek approval for alternative products and has collaborated with raw material suppliers 
 
to help address gaps in supply.Access to

products and therapies that address the unmet needs of 
patients around the world. In developing regions, these projects focus on factors such as limited infrastructure, 
poverty and lack of resources, which often limit access to 
healthcare. In these efforts, the company also considers 
possible application to other emerging markets, to leverage 
Baxter’s investment and expand its impact.
In 2014, Baxter continued to advance its business model 
innovation projects in China and India through innovation 
hubs that address health needs in those emerging markets, 
such as hemophilia, renal disease and safe intravenous (IV) 
infusions. For example, in India, where 80% of people with 
hemophilia are undiagnosed, Baxter innovation hub leaders spent time last year meeting and talking with patients, 
doctors, members of NGOs, hospital staff and accredited 
social health activist workers to learn more about the Baxter’s Approach to Business Model Innovation

Baxter also developed 10-year strategies for accelerating growth and increasing access to care in its renal, fluid systems and integrated pharmacy solutions franchises. 
Baxter is a member of the International Institute for 
Sustainable Enterprise and the International Partnership for Innovative Healthcare Delivery (IPIHD), a coalition affiliated with the World Economic Forum. Through these memberships, the company learns from leaders in the field about addressing emerging markets and innovating to find healthcare solutions. 
PRODUCT DONATIONS   GRI  4.8  LA8
Baxter donates products to help improve access to healthcare worldwide. In 2014, the company contributed more than $18 million in products, including through patient assistance programs, to help people in 71 countries 
(see map ).
To maximize impact, Baxter donates items that recipient organizations have requested, such as intravenous (IV) solutions, hemostatic sealants, pharmaceuticals and hemophilia products. The company’s Global Community Relations team manages the process, guided by Baxter’s Global Product Donation Policy, which covers areas such as licensing, expiration and dating, accounting and tax 
laws, and export requirements. The team works with supply 
chain managers and others at Baxter to identify donation opportunities, matching available inventory to patient need.
Baxter’s proactive, strategic approach to product donations 
improves process efficiency and effectiveness and facilitates 
timely, targeted support to communities in need. This approach also enhances aid organizations’ ability to plan and respond to emergencies, since the donor organizations Access to

know in advance what products to expect from Baxter. 
Additionally, they are able to house the products in their warehouses, allowing Baxter products to be ready for emergency airlifts.
During 2014, Baxter continued to work with its humanitarian 
aid partners—AmeriCares and Direct Relief—to pre-position products for emergencies as well as to address ongoing needs in underserved communities. AmeriCares, an 
international disaster-relief and humanitarian-aid 
organization, airlifts critical medicines, medical supplies and other aid to areas suffering humanitarian crises resulting from natural disasters or political strife. Direct Relief, a non-profit, non-sectarian humanitarian-assistance organization, provides medical assistance to victims of poverty, disaster and civil unrest. Baxter collaborates with these organizations to develop a yearly product donation plan. This helps ensure that Baxter contributes most-needed products to stabilize supply in least developed and developing economies, and that the company’s products are first on the scene following disasters and tragedies.
Baxter continued to work with International Health Partners 
(IHP), an organization dedicated to improving access to healthcare and medicines in the developing world by partnering with companies in Europe to provide donated medical aid to organizations serving needy communities. The company began its collaboration with IHP to help facilitate product donations from its sites in Europe. In 2014, Baxter contributed products with long shelf lives to enable aid organizations including IHP to provide a steady supply of 
medicines for ongoing support as well as critical therapies to 
offer in times of crisis. 
Pre-positioned to Assist in Crises
In response to the Ebola virus outbreak, Baxter donated medical products (and cash grants) to Direct Relief. The products, which included antibiotics, anesthetics, and 
IV-related pharmaceuticals, supplies and equipment,  had a total value of more than $200,000. There is no curative treatment for Ebola, but supportive care, including rehydration using intravenous fluids and the treatment of secondary infections, greatly improves survival rates. Baxter’s donations of IV solutions and related IV supplies and equipment, as well as antibiotics, are high priority items for healthcare facilities treating Ebola patients in West Africa. 
Both AmeriCares and Direct Relief played key roles in 
providing Baxter lifesaving fluids on their first airlifts to the affected areas early in the fall of 2014. The strategic 
pre-placement of Baxter fluid products enabled quick “first 
on the scene” placement for both organizations, which made multiple shipments to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Additionally, The Baxter International Foundation provided a $100,000 disaster relief grant to U.S. Fund for UNICEF to provide home hygiene kits to communities near the affected areas to stop the spread of the disease.
In Monrovia, Baxter products were essential in responding 
not only to the crisis, but also to re-establishing hospitals as they reopened in hard-hit areas, such as St. Joseph Catholic Hospital. That facility re-opened its maternity ward near the end of 2014 utilizing Baxter products.  
World Federation of Hemophilia Global Alliance  
for Progress  
Baxter also facilitates access to healthcare through support of non-profit organizations such as the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), dedicated to improving the lives of people with hemophilia and related bleeding disorders. Baxter is the founding sponsor of the organization’s Global Alliance for Progress (GAP) program, which works to improve access to hemophilia diagnosis, care and treatment. Since its launch in 2003, more than 28,300 patients have been diagnosed with hemophilia in 24 GAP countries. The 
program has also trained about 13,000 patients, family 
members and national member association board members. The program has also led to the implementation of national Access to

by ministries of health in 16 countries of memoranda of understanding that commit governments to a framework of hemophilia care and treatment delivery. There was also a cumulative increase in treatment product supply of more than 3.3 billion international units.
To help ensure that underserved countries have sufficient factor replacement treatment, Baxter has donated more than 4.5 million units of product over the past four years through the WFH, as well as its humanitarian aid partners such as AmeriCares.

Patient Assistance Programs
Baxter maintains U.S. patient assistance programs to help ensure continuous access to therapeutic products, for those who qualify, in the event of an insurance lapse.
Additionally, Baxter is a long-time supporter of Patient Services, Inc. (PSI), a non-profit organization that provides financial assistance to patients with rare disorders, to help them afford health insurance. Baxter contributes to PSI programs that support patients with bleeding disorders, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT) and primary immune deficiency.
Baxter also supports the myPN Support program, a patient assistance program for U.S. citizens and legal residents in the United States that helps qualifying patients maintain access to certain parenteral nutrition drug therapies.
Medical Missions
When healthcare professionals travel overseas to provide charitable medical care to under-served populations, they often work in hospitals and clinics lacking modern surgical materials. Baxter’s BioSurgery hemostatic and tissue sealant products as well as anesthesia products and IV solutions are some of the most requested Baxter products in these situations. During 2014, AmeriCares supported 262

In 2014, Baxter again donated a general inhalation 
anesthetic for use by the Helping Hands Medical Mission in El Salvador. Through the Helping Hands Medical Mission, 
doctors perform surgery at no cost for impoverished 
patients at El Hospital La Divina Providencia in Santiago.  
The team has evaluated more than 300 patients and performed more than 150 general abdominal surgeries during their past two missions. 
Medical mission teams also benefit from Baxter product 
donations. One patient in Lagawe, Philippines, a young pregnant woman, came to the emergency room suffering from fetal distress. Evaluation revealed this to be caused 
 
by a prolapsed umbilical cord; the team immediately performed an emergency cesarean section, while administering Baxter fluids, and in less than 15 minutes had delivered twin baby girls. The mother, who had never had a pre-natal exam, did not know she had been carrying twins.
Physician teams through AmeriCares medical outreach 
program in the Philippines also provided surgeries for children with cleft lip and palates, repairs that allow 
children with those congenital abnormalities to speak, eat 
and hear normally, and avoid the social stigma that often accompanies that condition. Dr. Conrad Zapanta and his team used Baxter products during their time at Ifugao General Hospital in Lagawe.Access to

WKD, which is an annual campaign initiated by the International Society of Nephrology and the International Federation of Kidney Foundations, was designed to support a global day of unity in raising awareness for kidney health, kidney disease and access to care. Baxter once again was a proud sponsor of the WKD campaign, as well as supported the movement around the world by organizing communications and

EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
Baxter employees contribute skills and expertise to 
benefit local communities. These efforts help recipient organizations advance their missions, and also provide employees with opportunities to grow personally and develop leadership skills.
Employee Volunteerism
In 2014, nearly 6,300 Baxter employees volunteered  
more than 128,000 hours in their communities, addressing local concerns such as healthcare, the environment and education. Employee involvement takes many forms, such as volunteering at a school or blood drive, serving at a hospital or food pantry, participating in community park clean-up days or joining a local non-profit organization board or committee. Employees at each Baxter site select volunteer activities to undertake and organizations to support, as they can best determine the most relevant 
 
and highest impact projects.
Employees track their efforts using Baxter’s internal volunteerism website. Since 2008, the company has logged nearly 962,000 hours and recognized employees who volunteer for 40 or more hours during the year.

employees from 42 states. Matches totaled nearly $850,000, 
which doubled the impact to over 775 charitable organizations.

2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Public Policy    GRI  SO5
Many legislative issues affect Baxter’s business globally, including reimbursement, tax, trade and a 
variety of regulatory concerns. The company’s Government Affairs and Public Policy (GAPP) team works with lawmakers, governments and policymakers worldwide to support patient access to Baxter’s life-saving therapies, increase understanding of the benefits of those therapies, address barriers to care and explore possible solutions. This involves engaging directly with governments to improve the regulatory environment and reimbursement structure for the company’s therapies, and collaborating with clinicians, non-governmental organizations and patient groups to increase access to care for millions of patients worldwide.

The Public Policy Committee of Baxter’s Board of Directors 
oversees the company’s government affairs activities. 
The committee reviews Baxter’s political contributions, positions on pending legislation and political advocacy 
efforts. For additional information, see Baxter’s 2014 Political 
Contributions Report . This details contributions made in 
2014 by Baxter and Baxter’s Political Action Committee, BAXPAC. It also includes information about the company’s membership in certain trade and industry groups.
Recognizing Baxter’s leadership in this area, the company 
was ranked among the first tier of companies for political disclosure, transparency and accountability in the 
2014  
CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and 
Accountability .
Baxter’s key focus areas include the following:
Physician Payments Sunshine Act 
Baxter is responding to federal requirements mandated  
by the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act. Read more  
in the Ethics and Compliance section . 
Engagement on Home Dialysis
Baxter participated in the 2014 National Summit on Home Dialysis Policy in Washington, D.C., to further the dialogue 
about the benefits of home dialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease and to discuss actions underway 
 
to alleviate recent peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution shortages. Home dialysis, including PD and home 
hemodialysis, are alternatives to in-center treatment, which generally requires patients to visit a clinic three times a week. Despite the widely accepted and well-documented benefits of home dialysis—including improved outcomes associated with more consistent treatments, enhanced patient satisfaction, 
improved quality of life and lower costs 
compared to in-center treatment—only about 10% of U.S. 
dialysis patients received treatment at home in 2012.1Baxter belongs to the Alliance for Home Dialysis, an organization focused on advocacy, policy recommendations and thought leadership. During 2014, the Alliance educated Congressional offices about home dialysis, nephrologist reimbursement practices through Medicare Part B and telehealth issues, helping to influence legislation related to these topics.
Increased Access for Hemophilia Patients in Romania
In early 2014, the Romania government announced a 40% increase in its hemophilia budget. This increase came after sustained engagement from Baxter’s Romania team and GAPP. Specifically, Baxter’s Romania leadership met with the Prime Minister, President, Foreign Minister, Minister of Finance and the Minister of Economy. The team provided background and analysis of hemophilia treatment targets in other EU countries and how such programs would benefit patients in Romania. As a result of the budget increase, 
Baxter Romania is providing more hemophilia products to 
patients in Romania.
Outreach on Behalf of Diverse Populations
In April 2014, Baxter’s GAPP team held its second annual Minority Health Month Fly-In in Washington, D.C. Members of Baxter’s business resource groups (BRGs), including the African-American Leadership Council, Asian Leadership Network and Latinos@Baxter, came from across the country to underscore the importance of developing strong public policies in the healthcare and medical device sectors to help address healthcare disparities that continue to affect racial and ethnic minorities. The team met with more than 
30 members of the Tri-Caucus, including members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American

National Minority Quality Forum Summit, where Dana 
Mendenhall, Baxter director of marketing, renal, presented 
to legislators, policy makers and clinical experts about racial disparities in treatment of chronic kidney disease.

2014 POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS REPORT    GRI  SO5  SO6
Baxter obeys all laws regarding engagement in the political process everywhere it operates. The company’s 
Code of Conduct , which states the core principles that 
govern Baxter’s business practices, contains a section on Public Affairs and Political Activities, including rules governing participation in the political process.
The Public Policy Committee of Baxter’s Board of Directors oversees Baxter’s government affairs program and Political Action Committee, BAXPAC. Each year, the Public Policy Committee reviews political contributions, positions on pending legislative, and other political advocacy initiatives.
This Political Contributions Report provides information about corporate contributions made in the United States by Baxter as well as contributions made by BAXPAC. It also includes information about Baxter’s lobbying expenses and membership in trade and industry groups.

Corporate Contributions
The U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United 
case in 2010 broadened the ability of corporations to make independent political expenditures in the context of federal elections (although not the ability to make direct contributions to federal candidates). However, Baxter has not made or considered such expenditures, and does not anticipate that the decision will impact how the company contributes or engages in the political process. Baxter strives to make contributions to candidates who champion 
and protect the legislative interests of the company, its 
employees and patients, without regard for the private 
political preferences of Baxter’s officers and executives. In 2014, the company did not participate in any ballot measures and it is not generally Baxter’s practice to do so.
In the United States, Baxter contributed $66,000 to state 
candidates and other candidate leadership and political organizations in 2014 after approval from the BAXPAC Board. U.S. law does not allow companies to make contributions to federal candidates. As discussed on the next page, contributions to federal candidates may be made by BAXPAC.Public Policy

Lobbying Expenses
In 2014, Baxter spent approximately $2,820,000 on 
federal lobbying-related activities in the United States, to promote policies that support the company’s objectives. This amount includes the salaries and overhead expenses of Baxter employees dedicated to this area, the value of time and related expenses of internal partners (such as corporate counsel), payments to external consultants and lobbyists and trade association dues used for lobbying.

Baxter maintains memberships in numerous industry 
and trade groups including organizations that engage in lobbying activities. The table (bottom left) includes the amount that Baxter has been notified was spent on federal-related lobbying activity during 2014 by any organization to which to the best of its knowledge Baxter paid more than $50,000 in dues or otherwise during the year. Baxter believes that membership in these organizations is generally consistent with the company’s interests as well as those of its shareholders, customers and patients. Even when Baxter does not share all of the views of one of these organizations, it believes that membership is worthwhile because such organizations encourage dialogue on important policy issues and help to move the industry towards consensus in these areas.Sustainability

115      BAXTER 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT1 Baxter used the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol (www.ghgprotocol.org) to calculate emissions data from fossil fuel use. The company used country electricity 
emission factors published by the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) E-Grid U.S. regional electricity emission factors to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to electricity consumption. 
2 Bureau Veritas North America, Inc. verified to a reasonable level Baxter’s 2012, 2013 and 2014 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. Bureau Veritas North America, Inc. also verified Baxter’s methodology for determining 2012, 2013 and 2014 Scope 3 GHG emissions to a limited level. 
 
3 Baxter estimated the GHG emissions of its first-tier and sub-tier suppliers (purchased goods and services) for 2012, 2013 and 2014 using modeling performed in relation to Baxter’s supply chain for 2012 by an independent firm and prorated to 2013 and 2014 using changing global sales. These estimates are based on data from other companies in the healthcare sector and representative suppliers as well as publicly reported Baxter financial and environmental data available for 2012. From these total estimated quantities, GHG emissions for Categories 3, 4 and 6 were subtracted to arrive at the Category 1 amounts reported for 2012, 2013 and 2014.
4 Estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 GHG emissions based upon 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures reported in Baxter’s annual reports and an estimated emission factor per million dollars of capital expenditure based in part upon benchmarking with industry.
5 GHG emissions calculated for 2012, 2013 and 2014 based upon Baxter’s actual yearly energy usage by energy type and GHG emission factors for each energy type per GaBi life cycle assessment software.
6 Upstream Transportation and Distribution GHG emissions determined by 1) an estimate of GHG emissions associated with Baxter’s supply chain (delivery of products and services to Baxter) based upon modeling by an independent firm for 2012 and prorated to 2013 and 2014 using changing global sales and 2) an independent third party calculating GHG emissions associated with the transportation of products to Baxter customers in 2012, 2013 and 2014. 
7 Estimated emissions for wastewater treatment by municipalities, and off-site waste recycling and disposal based in part upon guidance provided by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (United States) and the U.S. EPA Solid Waste Management and Greenhouse Gas Emissions guidelines.
8 Baxter calculated emissions associated with employee use of commercial airlines, rental cars and hotel stays based in part on data provided by company travel providers. Airline companies used by Baxter provided data regarding distances flown by Baxter employees in five geographic regions. Baxter used emission factors per UK Defra DECC GHG information to calculate associated GHG emissions. Information from travel providers regarding rental car distance traveled and number of hotel room stays along with emission factors based upon assumed vehicle fuel efficiency and average hotel room stay emissions per Conservation International were used to calculate reported GHG emissions.
9 Baxter used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to estimate GHG emissions related to employee commuting. The company based these estimates on an assessment of employee population by region, estimated average distances traveled to work, assumptions regarding mode of transportation, and assumptions about the blend of fuel used (gasoline and diesel fuels).
10 Emissions associated with upstream leased assets estimated at 3% of Baxter’s net emissions from operations.   
11 Baxter used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition to determine GHG emissions associated with using biomass fuel, principally wood/wood waste, as a boiler fuel at three Baxter locations. These emissions were calculated as 117,000, 123,000 and 130,000 metric tons CO
2 in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. CO2e emissions from CH4 and N2O components of biomass combustion included in reported Scope 1 
emissions.
12 Includes the purchase of electricity generated from 100% certified renewable electricity (Austria, Brazil, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States), and the purchase of carbon credits from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the Chicago Climate Exchange/InterContinental Exchange (United States) that were retired in 2012, 2013 and 2014.
 
13 Baxter used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to estimate GHG emissions associated with reported fuel usage by company-managed sales and distribution fleet vehicles and other vehicles. The company estimated fuel usage for international sales and distribution vehicles based on regional sales information. 
14 Refrigerant emissions represent reported CFC, HCFC and HFC refrigerant losses by each Baxter location. Baxter calculated associated GHG emissions using actual emission factors for each reported refrigerant. 
15 Baxter engaged an independent third party to calculate GHG emissions associated with the transportation of products to Baxter customers in 2012, 2013 and 2014. These GHG emissions are reported in Category 4. GHG emissions associated with Downstream Transportation and Distribution are estimated at 5% of the former emissions.  
16 Baxter continues to evaluate potential GHG emissions associated with this Scope 3 category.
17 Baxter estimated the emissions associated with the use and final disposition of products based upon available product production quantities and global warming potential information available for certain types of products. Emissions for certain other products were estimated.
18 Baxter estimated GHG emissions for this Scope 3 category based upon certain financial information presented in the company’s annual reports and the magnitude and annual change of net emissions from Baxter’s.
19 Totals do not include CO2 emissions from Baxter-owned wood-fired boilers. See footnote 11 above for detail.APPENDIX:    Baxter Value Chain Energy Usage and Greenhouse Gas Emissions (footnoted information from previous page )Sustainability

116      BAXTER 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT1Financial numbers rounded to nearest US$100,000 to reflect appropriate degree of data accuracy.  2Corporate environmental 
costs comprise total environmental costs related to operating corporate environmental programs that report into Baxter 
manufacturing and legal groups. While corporate Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) and certain business unit EHS groups were integrated in 2003, total business unit program costs remain in the Business Unit/Regional/Facility Environmental Professionals and Programs line, as those environmental costs more directly support facility programs.  
3Carbon taxes, expenses 
associated with purchasing renewable energy from electric utilities, renewable energy certificates, and carbon credits purchased on the European Union ETS and Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), through the U.S. Intercontinental Exchange. 
4Following 
completion of the 1996-2005 packaging-reduction goal, Baxter discontinued tracking program costs and financial savings associated with packaging-reduction initiatives at the corporate level. Baxter may reinstitute this line item in future financial statements.  
5Reflects change (positive for decrease and negative for increase) for purchases of raw materials due to changes in 
material use efficiency and associated generation of waste.  6In calculating savings and cost avoidance for waste-, energy- and 
water-reduction activities, it is assumed that production and distribution activities grew proportionately with Baxter’s publicly stated 
cost of goods sold, adjusted for changes in inventory and the average of three inflation indexes. Baxter uses a three-year rolling average of the annual percentage change in adjusted growth in the cost of goods sold to determine the financial values for each stated year. For 2014, the three-year rolling average was 2%; for 2013, 5%; for 2012, 3%; for 2011, 3%; and for 2010, 2%. This rolling average helps avoid distortions due to certain acquisitions/divestitures and the delayed environmental effects from changes in production.  
7To be conservative, the accumulation of reported cost avoidance from conservation activities in prior 
years is terminated after seven years, the approximate duration of many facility conservation and process-improvement projects, after which additional process improvements and changes are possible.

117      BAXTER 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTBackground
Baxter developed and consistently uses specific methodologies to estimate income, savings 
and cost avoidance each year, to enhance the reliability and comparability of the results. The company uses the following terms and conventions:
• Monetary amounts  Stated in U.S. dollars.
• Income  Money received in each of the reported years.
• Savings  Reduction in actual costs between the report year and the prior year. An 
increase in actual costs equals negative savings.
• Cost avoidance  Costs that the company would have incurred had the reduction activity not taken place. Conservation initiatives produce cost avoidance in the year commenced, and in future years in which the resource (such as energy, water or materials) remains eliminated from processes. To be conservative, Baxter stops accumulating cost avoidance from conservation activities after seven years (including the year implemented). This reflects the typical duration of many conservation projects, after which additional process 
improvements and changes are possible.
Calculating Savings and Cost Avoidance
In calculating savings and cost avoidance for resource reduction activities, Baxter assumes 
that production and distribution grow at the same rate as the company’s cost of goods sold, and that resource use and waste generation increase at that same rate in the absence of reduction initiatives. Baxter determines this rate by calculating the average annual increase in the company’s published cost of goods sold over the past six years. It then adjusts this number for new acquisitions and changes in inventory, and subtracts inflation, which is calculated as an average of three major, relevant U.S. producer-price indexes. The company then rounds the resulting growth rate down to the nearest whole number to conservatively report performance.
In calculations related to materials use, Baxter uses the current average cost of materials 
and the compounded growth in business activity.
Undetermined (and Unreported) Environmental-related Costs and Savings
The following undetermined costs are not included in the EFS:
• Environmentally driven materials research and other research and development, the costs 
of which are typically offset by increased sales and other non-environmental benefits not reported in the EFS;
• Capital costs of modifying processes and implementing certain resource conservation projects, other than adding pollution controls (these are typically offset by increased production rates, efficiencies and other non-environmental benefits not reported in the EFS);
• Cost of substitutes for ozone-depleting substances and other hazardous materials (estimated to be relatively minor); and
• Time spent by non-environmental employees on environmental activities (environmental 
training and responsibilities are part of every Baxter employee’s job). Baxter’s global environmental program also produces undetermined savings and other 
benefits that are not easily measured and are not included in the EFS. Examples include  
the following:
• Decreased liability exposure related to the operation of external regulated waste 
management sites by maintaining a program (launched in the 1980s) requiring a  
detailed audit of any such site before use by Baxter and periodic re-audits after the  
initial assessment;
• Reduced risk due to other risk-management programs, including performance of environmental due diligence on all business acquisitions and divestitures, use of a common set of EHS policies throughout Baxter operations, auditing those 
 
operations regularly against these policies and using a tracking system to resolve  
any audit findings;
• Decreased regulatory burden by reducing waste generation at Baxter below certain thresholds, which decreases training, recordkeeping, reporting, and administrative costs;
• Avoided costs for environmental problems that did not occur due to Baxter’s proactive efforts;
• Enhanced ability for employees to focus on higher value tasks due to the reduction of waste, possible spills and other potential environmental problems;
• Increased good will and brand value, improved company reputation and employee morale, and possible additional sales; and
• Attraction and retention of key personnel in part due to Baxter’s strong  
environmental program.

119      BAXTER 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTAPPENDIX:    Independent Assurance Statement
Introduction and objectives of work
Baxter engaged Bureau Veritas North America, Inc. (BVNA) of the 
Bureau Veritas Group to conduct an independent assurance of the Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) sections and selected Product Responsibility sections of Baxter’s online 2014 Sustainability Report (the Report). Baxter has commissioned assurance for the EHS section of its annual sustainability report for the past 16 years.
This Assurance Statement applies to the related information included within the scope of work described below. That information and its presentation in the Report is the sole responsibility of Baxter management. BVNA was not involved in the drafting of the Report. Our sole responsibility was to provide independent assurance on the accuracy and reliability of information included, and on the underlying systems and processes used to collect, analyze and review the selected pages of the Report.
Scope of work
Baxter requested BVNA to conduct reasonable level assurance of the Report to verify the accuracy of the following:
• Data and information included in the EHS section of the Report.
• Data and information included in the following selected pages of the Product Responsibility section of the Report: Materials Use, Packaging, Product End of Life, and Product Sustainability.
Excluded from the scope of our work is any assurance of information relating to:
• Activities outside the defined assurance period, the calendar year of 2014;
• Positional statements (expressions of opinion, belief, aim or future intention) by Baxter 
and statements of future commitment;
• Any financial data previously audited by an external third party; and
• Data and information included in sections of the Report that are not listed in the scope of work above.
Methodology
Our work was conducted against BVNA’s standard procedures and guidelines for external Assurance of Sustainability Reports, based on the requirements of the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) as the reference assurance standard and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 Guidelines as the reference reporting standard.
The work was planned and carried out to provide reasonable, rather than absolute, 
assurance and we believe it provides a reasonable basis for our conclusions.As part of BVNA’s reasonable assurance, BVNA undertook the following activities:
1. Interviews with relevant Baxter personnel and select individuals responsible for collecting and reporting EHS and Product Responsibility performance data and other information. These interviews included discussion with management personnel and staff members responsible for preparing text and contributing data for sections of the Report within the scope of this assurance;
2.  Review of documentary evidence produced by Baxter to support information presented in sections of the Report within the scope of this assurance;
3.  Evaluation of the information presented in the Report sections based on consideration of the GRI G3 Guidelines with emphasis on principles of accuracy, accessibility, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness;
4. Audit of performance data, including review of a sample of data to source documentation during visits to representative manufacturing sites located in: Irvine, California, United States; Lessines, Belgium; Lublin, Poland; Miyazaki, Japan; and Northampton, United Kingdom.
5. Review of Baxter data and information systems used for collection, aggregation, analysis and review of EHS and product responsibility information during visits to Baxter’s corporate EHS office in Round Lake, Illinois.
Our findings
On the basis of our methodology and the activities described above, it is our opinion that the EHS section and selected Product Responsibility sections of the Report within the scope of this assurance:
• are accurate, reliable and free from material mistake or misstatement;
• are presented in a clear, understandable and accessible manner;
• provide a fair and balanced representation of activities; and
• allow readers to form a balanced opinion of Baxter’s activities and performance 
during the calendar year of 2014.
It is also our opinion that Baxter has established appropriate systems for the collection, aggregation, analysis and review of relevant information and data related to the EHS section and selected Product Responsibility sections of the Report within the scope of this assurance.

120      BAXTER 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTAdditional commentary
During the assurance process, BVNA was pleased to observe that Baxter has:
• Continued to report on progress toward 2015 goals in a balanced manner;
• Continued to implement energy efficiency projects aimed at reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions associated with operations; and
• Developed systems for evaluating data for the BioScience and Medical Products/Renal businesses separately.
Based on the work conducted, we recommend Baxter consider the following:
• Update the materiality assessment to allow for reporting in accordance with GRI G4 
next year;
• Continue to refine estimation methods used for metrics that are not directly measured; and
• Encourage operating sites to conduct secondary reviews of data prior to submission.

EN27 Percentage of products sold and their packaging 
materials that are reclaimed by category. (Core)Product End-of-Life
The European Union packaging directive requires Baxter to reclaim 
packaging and to submit related 
reports. Baxter typically pays third parties fees of about $0.8 million 
per year to do this, as indicated 
on the company’s Environmental Financial Statement. Baxter does not currently have systems to track overall 
quantities of packaging materials 
reclaimed. Baxter’s products are primarily disposable medical products. 
Reclamation of these products is 
difficult since often they must be disposed of as biohazardous waste 
after their use. Baxter continues to 
explore means to reclaim and recycle products with its customers.

If a company fails to comply with 
regulations in the United States, the FDA 
or the Department of Justice may initiate 
civil or criminal enforcement actions. Enforcement actions can range from 
an untitled letter (the least serious) or a 
warning letter (an elevated action) up to a criminal indictment. In 2014, Baxter received zero untitled letters and two warning 
letters from the U.S. FDA. The company 
also had a Regulatory Meeting with FDA, agreeing to work closely with the Agency 
and provide regular updates on its progress 
to meet all requirements and resolve all 
matters identified in the warning letters. 
Comparable information is not commonly 
available outside the United States.
