GAZPROM NEFT  2013 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORTADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD
In 2013, Gazprom Neft’s financial and operating 
achievements continued to demonstrate the Company’s leadership role and the success 
of its sustainable growth strategy.
Gazprom Neft’s production increased by 4.3% 
in 2013, to 62.26 MTOE. The proven hydrocarbon reserves amounted to 1.3 bn TOE, an 11.9%  year-on-year growth.
In the course of field development last year, 
Gazprom Neft implemented new and innovative process solutions. Its share of high-technology wells of the total volume of drilled wells has increased from 4% to 35% over the last two years, underlining the Company’s position as one of Russia’s oil and gas leaders.PREVIOUS CHAPTER NEXT CHAPTER CONTENTS5
www.gazprom-neft.comIn 2013, the Company completed a product quality programme at all its refineries, 
with a switchover to production of Class 5 motor fuel considerably ahead of the deadline set by federal Technical Regulations. In 2014, Gazprom Neft will focus on deeper refining projects in line with its Development Strategy. Following modernisation, our refining facilities will match the operating standards of the best refineries in the world.
The achievement of Gazprom Neft’s strategic objectives is based on the systematic 
and balanced management of its business, social, and environmental activities.
The Company aims to continuously improve its HSE activities in accordance with 
global best practices and through its own, innovative developments. As a result of consistent focus on performance in this area, accident and injury rates decreased in 2013.
The Company is successfully developing and implementing environmental 
programmes to minimise any technological and man-made impacts on the environment. Aggregate air emissions in 2013 decreased by 28% year-on-year.
Energy saving and efficiency is another key area of Gazprom Neft’s activities. 
By implementing energy conservation measures, the Company successfully saved over RUB 1.2 bn in 2013.We place great emphasis on HR management and employee development. There are training programmes in place at Gazprom Neft to ensure skill upgrading, development of strategically important professional and personal competencies, and creation of a candidate pool. In 2013, over 42,000 employees received such training. Training investment amounted to RUB 535 million. The Company is consistent in improving the efficiency of employee social support programmes and implementing best international practices. In 2014, a unified system of social benefits will be introduced for all Gazprom Neft enterprises.
Gazprom strives to be a partner for local communities in their efforts to meet 
social and economic challenges, and encourages the active public and community engagement in the development of the regions. In 2013, as part of the ‘Home Towns’ social investment programme, the Company implemented some 350 projects, including those to improve the urban environment and create an infrastructure for children and grassroots sports, education and health initiatives, 
and programmes aimed at preserving the cultural legacy of the native minorities of the Northern Russia. Total costs associated with Company’s social and charity programmes were nearly RUB 4 bn in 2013.
Gazprom Neft will continue to create conditions for achieving its ambitious strategic 
goals on the basis of the sustainable development and social responsibility principles as the key to the long-term competitiveness of the Company.

GAZPROM NEFT  2013 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORTABOUT THE COMPANY
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE:  
2013 RESULTS
This reporting year was a successful one for Gazprom Neft. The Company improved its performance against 
almost all operating and financial indicators: production, operating and net profits increased, despite negative market conditions, including a fall in oil and petroleum product prices, an increase in MRT and natural monopoly rates, and an increase in excise duties on different fuel types.
Total production by OJSC Gazprom Neft rose by 4.3% 
in 2013, to 62.26 million tonnes of oil equivalent. The Gazprom Neft Group’s proved hydrocarbon reserves as of 31 December 2013 totalled 1.34 bn TOE, a year-on-year growth of 11.9%.
The volume of oil refining in 2013 totalled 
42.63 million tonnes. In 2013, all of the Company’s refineries switched over to the production of Euro 4 and Euro 5 fuels. In the reporting year, the Company became the largest supplier of light petroleum products in its operating regions, with a 21.6% share. The Company’s filling station chain comprises 1,747 filling stations in Russia, the CIS and the Eastern Europe. Sales of petroleum products through Russian filling stations grew by 11%, to 7.3 million tonnes. The average daily sales of petroleum products per filling station in the country reached 19 tonnes per day, and increased by 7.8%.
The growth of hydrocarbon production and the 
significant increase in sales through premium distribution channels led to a higher adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation), up 4.2% (RUB 336.8 bn). Net profit amounted to RUB 177.9 bn, a year-on-year increase of 0.9%. At the end of 2013, the Company became one of the industry leaders in terms of operating profit per BOE produced and adjusted operating profit (subject to performance of joint ventures). At year-end 2013, the dividend yield of OJSC Gazprom Neft shareholders also remained the highest among its industry peers. The results achieved confirm the status of the Company as an industry leader.

GAZPROM NEFT  2013 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORTThe Company is rapidly developing its gas business, focused on commercialising associated and 
natural gas reserves at oil fields and realising the maximum value of gas. Total natural gas produced by subsidiaries and affiliates in 2013 was 5.96 billion cubic metres, including 5.91 billion cubic metres of marketable gas. Total gas production by 100% subsidiaries and affiliates grew from 9.3 bn in 2012, to 11.9 bn cubic metres. This growth was due to the implementation of both the Muravlenkovskoye natural gas production project and APG utilisation projects. A compressor station went into operation in the southern licence area of the Priobskoye field in the middle of 2013. As part of the APG utilisation improvement project at the Yuzhno-Priobskaya area, the construction of a new gas processing plant (GPP) with an annual processing capacity of 900 million cubic metres based at the existing Yuzhno- Priobskaya compressor station was approved. The Noyabrsky Integrated Project, which completed its initial phase in October 2012, also significantly contributed to progress. The Company has developed 2014-2016 programme for associated petroleum gas utilisation by subsidiaries and affiliates which was approved in 2013. The programme includes a project portfolio to expand the APG utilisation capacities in Orenburg, Tomsk, and the Muravlenko region.

Exploratory drilling footageABOUT THE COMPANY
EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION 
OF CRUDE OIL AND GAS
Total production by OJSC Gazprom Neft rose by 4.3% in 2013, to 62.26 million tonnes of oil equivalent. 
The Company ranks first in Russia in terms of production growth. Oil-equivalent production growth has been achieved thanks to the production assets purchased in 2011-2012 (CJSC Gazprom Neft Orenburg, LLC Technology Research Centre, OJSC Yuzhuralneftegaz, and LLC Zhivoy Istok) and highly efficient interventions at the Western Siberian fields.
Strategic achievements in 2013 included the start 
of oil production at the Prirazlomnoye field (the first tanker shipment took part early in 2014, and at least 300,000 tonnes of oil production is planned, with a potential production level of about 6 million tonnes) and the organisation of winter transportation of oil from the Novoportovskoye and East-Messoyakhskoye fields, as well as an increase in the share of the SeverEnergia project. As part of a strategic goal to create growth centres at non-conventional reserves, a JV was established with Shell, and the first commercial volumes were obtained from the Bazhenov suite in the Palianovskaya well area of the Krasnoleninskoye field in 2013.
The main drivers of growth in the Company’s resource 
base in 2013 included the results of a geological survey. The Company’s subsidiaries achieved a high level of exploration drilling, with a success rate of 75% at the end of the past year. In the reporting year, the East Myginskoe field was discovered in the Tomsk Region, along with another 31 oil deposits and two gas deposits.
In 2013, the Company acquired two new licences 
in Russia, for the Yuzhno-Pudinskiy licence area and the Dolginskoye field. In Iraqi Kurdistan, Gazprom Neft expanded its presence by taking part in a new geological survey project, Halabja.PREVIOUS CHAPTER NEXT CHAPTER CONTENTS21
www.gazprom-neft.comREFINING
In 2013, Gazprom Neft maintained its leading position among Russian oil companies in terms of refining output. 
During the reporting year, 42.63 million tonnes of crude oil were refined and 40.5 million tonnes of commercial petroleum products were produced at the Company’s facilities.
In 2013, there was an insignificant reduction 
compared to 2012 (-1.6%) in the total refining volume at the Company’s refineries, due to a period of scheduled maintenance at the Company’s refineries. Since 2009, OJSC Gazprom Neft has been implementing a large-scale refinery modernisation programme, not only to improve the quality of its products, but also to make motor fuels more environmentally friendly and minimise their environmental impact.
The Omsk refinery is still Russia’s largest refinery 
in terms of refining volumes and output of light petroleum products (67.5%). The Moscow refinery moved up two rankings among Russian factories in terms of refining depth (up almost 5% in 2013).
In 2013, ahead of the deadline set by federal Technical 
Regulations all of the Company’s refineries switched over to the production of fuels of the highest environmental standards – Euro 4 and Euro 5.INCREASING PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY

REFINING  
(CONTINUED)
The Moscow refinery is a leading producer of highoctane petrol and 
diesel, meeting approximately 40% of demand for petroleum products in the Moscow region. In 2013, refining output was 11.08 million tonnes of oil, a year-on-year increase of 3.8% and a record result. Bitumen production also reached a record level of 1.07 million tonnes, a year-on-year increase of 48.3%. In 2013, tthe Moscow refinery completed the first stage of its upgrade programme, which enabled the factory to fully switch over to the production of Euro 5 high-octane automotive gasoline. The refinery also began production of Euro 5 diesel fuel. The refinery will supply Moscow and Central Russia with better quality gasoline and diesel that meets European standards. This will significantly contribute to the reduction of harmful emissions and have a positive effect on the environment. Based on performance in 2013, the World Refining Association (WRA) declared the Moscow refinery the best oil refinery in the CIS. The Moscow refinery also received an environmental award from the Moscow Government in the category “Best project implemented with the use of green and energy efficient technologies.”Gazprom Neft operates five oil refining assets. The Company’s own capacities include the Omsk refinery, Moscow refinery, and NIS, a two-plant international refining facility. The Company has also access to the assets of the Yaroslavl refinery (YANOS) and Mozyr refinery.
The Omsk refinery is one of the most advanced in Russia and the largest 
in the world. In the reporting year, its crude oil refining output was 20.2 million tonnes, including 0.4 million tonnes of gas condensate – the highest volume among all Russian refineries. Omsk refinery products won the “100 Best Products in Russia” competition once again in 2013
7.
The NIS refineries refined a total of 2.747 million tonnes of crude oil in 2013; in addition, 137,400 tonnes of other hydrocarbons were refined. Despite the fact that the Novi-Sad refinery is currently under reconstruction, the Panchevo plant’s capacity has enabled NIS not only to cover all local demand within the Serbian market, but also to export fuels to the Balkan countries.
OJSC Slavneft-Yaroslavnefteorgsintez (YANOS) produces fuel and lubricants 
using a deep crude oil refining system, which ranks fifth among Russian refineries in terms of primary processing volumes. In 2013, primary refining by YANOS was 15.0 million tonnes and Gazprom Neft’s share was 7.5 million tonnes (50%). The Mozyr refinery, located in the south of the Republic of Belarus, refined 1.05 million tonnes of oil in 2013.

GAZPROM NEFT  2013 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORTABOUT THE COMPANY
The Company was the first in the Russian oil and gas industry to remodel its regional sales network 
in order to improve business efficiency by dividing it into retail and wholesale segments and implementing legislative changes. This project will involve the reorganisation of the nine existing regional petroleum product suppliers into eight specialised entities, covering a specific business line. The project’s main development in 2013 was the start of operations by LLC Gazprom Neft – Regional Sales and OJSC GPN –Transport; LLC Gazprom Neft – Corporate Sales also started operating.RETAIL SALES 
One of the Company’s key business lines is the development of its filling stations. Gazprom Neft has one of 
the best developed retail networks in Russia and further strengthened its market position in 2013, becoming the most significant supplier of light petroleum products in regions where it operates (market share of 21%). The Company’s filling station chain comprises 1,747 filling stations operating in 26 regions in Russia, CIS and the Eastern Europe.
At the beginning of 2014, there were 1,339 Gazprom 
Neft filling stations in Russia and the CIS. In 2013, 8.4 million tonnes of petroleum products were sold through the Company’s filling stations in Russia and the CIS (+13% compared to 2012). Sales of petroleum products through Russian filling stations grew by 11%, to 7.3 million tonnes. Average petroleum product sales per filling station in Russia increased by 7.8%, to 19.0 tonnes per day in 2013.
In the reporting year, Gazprom Neft continued 
to implement its premium branded fuel sales programmes at its own filling stations. 380,000 tonnes of G-Drive 95 premium fuel was sold in 2013. At year-end 2013, 808 Gazprom Neft filling stations were selling this type of fuel. The Company also started selling G-Drive 95 motor fuel in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Belarus in 2013. In February 2013, the Company’s filling stations began selling G-Drive 98 premium motor fuel. 12,000 tonnes of this fuel type were sold in 2013 and by year-end, 320 of the Company’s filling stations were promoting G-Drive 98 fuel.
Gazprom Neft is placing particular emphasis on 
increasing its sales of the two main gas motor fuels, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and compressed natural gas (CNG). These fuels represent important oopportunities in terms of environmentally friendly and cost efficient transportation, which is particularly relevant for urban public and commercial transport. In 2013, out of all multi-fuel filling facilities, 176 gas filling stations were branded Gazpromneft. The respective sales of LPG and CNG in 2013 were 94,000 tonnes (a year-on-year increase of 1.0%) and 9,000 tonnes (a year-on-year increase of 10.7%).

ABOUT THE COMPANY
INNOVATION
Gazprom Neft considers innovation to be a valuable 
tool that ensures the efficiency and technological improvement of the Company, which is essential in order to achieve its strategic goals in both the upstream and downstream sectors.
In 2013, the Gazprom Neft Board of Directors approved the Company’s 2020 
Innovation Development Programme, which includes information on the main areas of Gazprom Neft’s innovation development, as well as key performance indicators corresponding to the indicators of the Innovative Development Programme of OJSC Gazprom, the major shareholder. The Programme’s primary aim is to enhance the Company’s technological skill in the areas of exploration, production, and refining.
In the reporting period, the Company developed and approved an Innovation Policy 
setting out the key principles and approaches to managing innovation development, relating to the analysis of technological challenges, the research and selection of possible solutions, and the implementation of innovation projects.
In the second half of 2013, the Company established a Strategy and Innovation

www.gazprom-neft.comIn the reporting year, a large-scale implementation of advanced 
production technologies was witnessed at enterprises of the Exploration and Production Segment, the main technological development areas 
of which include:
 Improving forecasts of the resource base;
 Profitable increase of production and the oil recovery rate at current fields;
 Developing oil and gas condensate reservoirs;
 Developing fractured reservoirs;
 Developing offshore fields;
 Developing the Bazhenov formation;
 Improving industrial and environmental safety.
In 2013, projects to introduce multi-stage fracturing assemblies at horizontal wells 
were initiated at 10 of the Company’s major fields in order to develop reserves with low filtration properties. Applying this technology allowed the formation coverage area to increase without increasing the costs associated with drilling additional wells. The average increase in the daily oil yield amounted to 46.4 tonnes. Additional oil production totalled over one million tonnes as of 1 January 2014.
For the first time in Russia, a horizontal well was brought on-stream following 
a ten-stage hydraulic fracturing process at Gazprom Neft’s Vyngapurovskoye field, operated by OJSC Gazpromneft Noyabrskneftegaz. The depth of the new well is nearly 4,500 metres, and the length of the horizontal section is over 1,000 metres. The flow rate obtained at the well was over 135 tonnes per day, which exceeded the results obtained at horizontal wells with a lower number of hydraulic fracturing stages by approximately one-third.
An acid multiple hydraulic fracturing operation was carried out for the first time 
in the eastern area of the Orenburg oil and gas condensate field as part of Gazprom Neft’s depleted reserves programme. Once the operations have been completed, the combined average flow rate of both wells will add up to approximately 80 tonnes of oil per day. The wells function via natural flow. Horizontal well drilling with multi- stage hydrofracturing is currently one of the main technologies for recovering depleted reserves.
The rotary steerable systems – a new generation of downhole equipment for drilling 
wells – reduced capital costs by 0.6%, whilst increasing hydrocarbon production by 0.6 million tonnes.In the past year, Salym Petroleum Development, a joint venture between Gazprom Neft and Shell, continued with its pilot project to introduce a technology for alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) water flooding to increase oil yield from formations at the Zapadno-Salymskoye field.
In the reporting period, Gazprom Neft drilled the very first Russian four-borehole 
horizontal well at the Umseyskoye field.
A new world seismic surveying record was set at the Shakal block in the Iraqi 
Kurdish Autonomous Region. During the seismic study, data was transmitted from more than 6,200 sensors. This is the highest number of sensors ever used in simultaneous wireless real-time data transmission. The application of this innovative technology will enable the Company to improve the quality of its geological surveys, by reducing time and improving efficiency.FIELD EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT
In 2013, Gazprom Neft continued its study of oil reserves at the Bazheno-Abalaksky complex of the Palianovskaya area at the Krasnoleninskoye field. Once Gazprom Neft had completed tests on the first exploration well of 2,700–2,800 metres in depth, which resulted in an oil flow at a rate of 80 tonnes per day, a model of the field and the complex reserves was built. The model of a fracture-block stratum structure allows the identification of potentially productive zones for the drilling new wells. The well revealed that the fracture zone was an oil filtration channel. In autumn 2014, Gazprom Neft will consider moving on to the next stage – drilling commercial production wells at the Bazhenov suite.Previously, a joint venture between Gazprom Neft and Shell – Salym Petroleum Development (SPD) – had started to develop the Bazhenov suite of the Verkhne-Salymskoye oil field in the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District. In April 2013, Gazprom Neft and Shell also signed an agreement to set up a joint venture looking at new projects to explore and develop shale oil reserves in the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District – Yugra.Approximately 4.5% of the Company’s own production in 2013 was generated thanks to the application of technologies such as horizontal wells, multi-stage hydraulic fracture technology, side tracking, rotary steerable systems and oil-based muds.

OIL REFINING AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY
A LARGE PROPORTION OF REFINING INNOVATION PROJECTS ARE IMPLEMENTED AS PART OF REFINERY MODERNISATION 
PROGRAMMES. RECONSTRUCTION AND THE LAUNCH OF NEW PLANTS WILL ENABLE THE COMPANY TO CONSIDERABLY REDUCE MAZUT PRODUCTION AND INCREASE THE OUTPUT OF LIGHT PETROLEUM PRODUCTS TO 77% AND THE REFINING DEPTH TO 95% BY 2025.
Refining and petrochemical R&D initiatives are implemented in partnership with 
the leading Russian research institutions that already have some know-how in Gazprom Neft’s priority fields of technology. The Company’s partners include the Topchiev Institute of Petrochemical Synthesis, RAS, Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas, Institute of Hydrocarbon Processing of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences and OJSC All-Russian Research Institute of Oil Refining. The Company’s key cooperation areas with research organisations and universities in 2013 included the development of catalysts and the improvement of oil refining processes.
In 2013, a process was developed for viscosity breaking and coking gasoline 
refining without the use of molecular hydrogen. The method under development will significantly increase the refining depth of thermal process gasoline and the quality of product output. In particular, the application of the new technology may help to reduce the olefin content in the gasoline output by over 95%, and sulphur content by over 98%, with an approximate output of 90% gasoline fraction mass. Moreover, the octane level of the refined gasoline will increase by 4–5 points.2013 also saw an active implementation of projects to develop technologies aimed at obtaining gasoline components with no less than 92-95 octane level. Development began on the creation of a green technology prototype aimed at producing solid acid catalyst-based alkylates. A laboratory research stage was completed for the indirect alkylation technology aimed at obtaining high-octane components from low molecular weight olefins. A pilot plant is expected to be launched next year to commercialise this technology. The Company developed its own catalyst to obtain an oligomerizate, another high-octane component. These projects will provide the Company with its own technologies that enable it to produce premium-grade gasoline. The Company’s deeper refining projects include a tar hydrocracking project aimed at producing at least 90% light petroleum products from the heavy oil stock.
Isodewaxing catalyst research and testing was completed, and the catalyst will be 
used to produce winter and Arctic fuels. The R&D results are protected by patents for inventions.
In 2013, the Oil Refining Department initiated an R&D market and specialist analysis 
in the oil refining and petrochemical industry to engage the most competent researchers in order to meet the Company’s technological development objectives. The project will be completed by creating an R&D priority list by 2025.One of the priorities of the Company’s innovation policy is energy efficiency, including the optimal use of existing resources.In July 2013, NIS lunched the first cogeneration module as part of a long-term programme for the efficient use of gas resources. The cogeneration project involves APG utilisation. The programme also envisages the construction of an amine plant at the NIS LPG workshop and the start of CO
2 injection – after 
CO2 separation at the amine plant – to operating wells (to increase hydrocarbon 
recovery). This programme will not only enable NIS to generate electric and heat power using its own resources (APG), but also to improve the quality of the natural gas produced by the company at its gas fields. This programme will help NIS utilise up to 90% of the associated gas – that is, 90 million cubic metres per year – as soon as year-end 2014.

Risks Description Risk management activities
RISKS RELATED TO CHANGES 
IN LICENCE COMPLIANCE FOR MAIN BUSINESS LINESSub-soil legislation is evolving towards a more detailed regulation of sub-soil usage by the Government, more rational use of sub-soil 
areas, and strict compliance with legal standards for environmental 
protection.Gazprom Neft operates its licence areas in strict compliance with 
the requirements of Russian sub-soil legislation, and updates its 
licence agreements to ensure their compliance with relevant laws.
The Company analyses and assesses legislative initiatives by 
relevant ministries and departments in the area of sub-soil 
legislation and licensing.
Gazprom Neft is not aware of any legal risks directly associated 
with the loss of sub-soil rights or breaches of current law due to these legislative changes.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKSGazprom Neft’s operations have an inherent health risk and a risk of damage to or pollution of the natural environment. This may give rise to civil law liability and require action to mitigate such damage. The Company is fully aware of its responsibility before the public, and its obligation to ensure safe working conditions and protection of the natural environment. The Company ensures that its operations comply with applicable environmental standards and 
that it implements environmental protection programmes.Gazprom Neft’s health, safety and environmental policy aims 
to comply with the applicable laws and regulations by investing considerable funds in injury prevention, transport and fire safety programmes, and environmental activities, including the use of technologies that minimise the environmental risks. As a result, risks related to employee injuries and environmental pollution have been greatly reduced.
RISKS RELATED HUMAN RESOURCESThe oil and gas industry lacks human resources and managers along the entire value chain – from upstream to downstream.The Company develops and implements succession pool and employee training and development programmes aimed to provide the Company with competent staff at present and in the future. Gazprom Neft employees are offered competitive remuneration that includes a salary, performance-based bonuses, and a social package. 
CORRUPTION RISKS As the Company actively enters new international markets, there are increasing risks of anti-corruption laws in the US and UK being extended to the Company.Gazprom Neft is working on a program to control corruption risks. Essentially, the strategy is to take proactive steps to minimise the risks of liability for any lack of procedures to prevent bribery. The programme will assess the role of corruption risk in the Com -
pany’s risk management system, design a corporate policy, and devise a communications strategy and provide appropriate employee training required for the project implementation.PREVIOUS CHAPTER NEXT CHAPTER CONTENTS53
www.gazprom-neft.com17 The Company’s stakeholders are the organisations and individuals whose interests are in some way or another affected by the decisions or operations of the Company and who, in turn, can affect the Company’s performance.STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Gazprom Neft believes that 
stakeholder engagement17 is 
essential to the implementation of our sustainable development strategy. The Company engages with its stakeholders based on the principles of transparency and availability of the information that it provides. Gazprom Neft maintains a continuous dialogue with all stakeholders.
Following the recommendations of ISO 26000:2010 
(‘Guidance on Social Responsibility’), the Company is committed to respecting the interests of its stakeholders – not just those who may be connected to the Company’s own goals and commitments, but also those reflecting the interests of society as a whole.
The Company identifies a number of key stakeholder 
groups whose interests are most noticeably linked with its activities and who, in turn, can have the most significant impact on the Company’s ability to implement its strategic goals:
 Shareholders and investors;
 Public authorities;
 Personnel;
 Business partners, suppliers, and customers; and
 Local communities. The main priorities of stakeholder engagement are stated in the corporate regulations (the Corporate Code of Conduct, the Corporate Code, and documents governing individual business areas).
In forming its approaches to shareholder engagement, 
the Company takes into account the level and scale of the relationships (federal, regional or local), as well as the extent of formalisation (informal/fixed in the contracts or other documents). The Company seeks to build a balanced approach to stakeholder engagement that takes into account the interests of all stakeholders and contributes to the achievement of sustainable development goals.The scope of issues addressed in the dialogue depends on the internal and external social environment continuously analysed by the Company and reflects the Company’s strategic road map and stakeholders’ priorities.
The Company takes steps to involve stakeholders 
in the implementation of its projects. This allows the Company to adjust the progress of projects according to stakeholders’ expectations and to identify and eliminate existing risks in good time.

SUPPLIERS 
The Company builds relations with its suppliers based on the principles 
of business ethics, mutual responsibility, transparency and competitiveness in partner selection, and a common approach 
to achieving production objectives and the required product quality. 
The Company is pursuing cooperation with its suppliers to enhance the operating 
efficiency, environmental safety and occupational health, and seeks to ensure that its suppliers and contractors comply with the rules of industrial, environmental and occupational safety, and social protection adopted by the Company.
According to the “Procedure for managing contractors and cooperative

CUSTOMERS

of a stable and reliable supplier and 
to increase levels of service in its interaction 
with customers. To this end, the Company implements programmes aimed at improving 
product quality and environmental safety 
in accordance with international standards, provides responsible marketing information, 
and regularly reviews customer requirements 
and satisfaction levels.
Gazprom Neft produces goods under its own two 
brands – the Gazprom Neft filling station chain and G-Drive premium-grade fuel. According to a study by Nielsen, a global information and measurement company, one-fourth of Russian motorists preferred Gazprom Neft filling stations in 2013. The Gazprom Neft filling station chain and G-Drive enhanced performance fuel rank within the top three best-known retail brand names on the Russian fuel market in their respective categories.
The high level of brand loyalty among customers 
contributes to the Company’s retail sales dynamic growth both in Russia and abroad. GAZPROM filling stations, which were launched in Southeastern Europe at the end of 2012, expanded in 2013 into Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and their number is growing in Romania and Serbia. By the end of 2015, there will be at least 250 GAZPROM filling stations in the Balkans. In 2013, GAZPROM was recognised as the best retail brand in Serbia and also in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Six types of product from the Omsk refinery obtained Russia’s 100 Best Products awards 
in the Industrial and Technical Products category. Golden diplomas were awarded to the Premium  Euro-95 Unleaded Gasoline (Euro 5) and Diesel Fuel intended for the moderate climate, with an ultra-
low sulphur content and low level of combustion emissions. “Silver” diplomas were given to aviation jet fuel TC 1 used to fuel military and civil aircrafts, and oil paraxylene of the maximum purity used in the petrochemical industry. The paraxylene purity from the Omsk refinery is 99.9% while the required level is 99.5%. Silver awards were also given to fuel for ship units (RMG 380) with a low sulphur content and polymer-viscosity graded bitumen PBV-90 which is used in paving construction and repair. The use of PBV-90 in road construction enhances the thermal shock resistance of paving, thus extending the road lifetime. PBV-90 was classified as a specialty product.PREVIOUS CHAPTER NEXT CHAPTER CONTENTS61

Since summer 2013, all of the Company’s facilities have switched 
to the production of Euro 5 motor fuels – a full 2.5 years ahead of the deadline set by the Russian Technical Regulations. The Moscow refinery was honoured by the Moscow Government for its switchover to this fuel and was ranked second in an environmental contest.At the beginning of 2014, there were 1,339 Gazprom Neft filling stations in Russia 
and the CIS. At the end of the reporting year, the average daily sales at filling stations grew by more than 7% to 19 tonnes, a record for the Russian industry.
One of the most effective tools used to increase sales volumes and brand 
confidence is a nationwide loyalty programme for individuals known as Going the Same Way, which was launched by the Company in 2010. The program is currently run in all the regions of Russia and CIS (Republic of Belarus) where Gazprom Neft filling stations operate. Since the loyalty programme was launched, over 4.3 million customers have joined it. The share of Going the Same Way sales account for over 70% (almost 90% in a number of regions).
In 2013, the Company also extended its line of G-Drive premium fuels and G-Energy 
and G-Profi premium motor oils, with improved environmentalm characteristics. The brand, previously used for industrial equipment oils only, was expanded to include synthetics, synthetic blends, and conventional oils for gasoline and diesel engines in cars and trucks, as well as transmission oils, lubricants, and technical fluids. Gazprom Neft is actively developing new premium products, particularly high-quality bitumen materials.
The Company promotes international quality standards in the Russian market not 
only for fuel, but also for services. The International Association of Air Transport (IATA) rated seven Gazprom Neft-Aero integrated fuelling facilities as the best service providers of quality jet fuel supply, thus allowing them to fuel aircrafts without any restrictions. IATA experts note the high level of both the operational and environmental safety of the Company’s integrated fuelling facilities.
An important part of customer engagement is the system for responding 
to customer dissatisfaction with the quality of products or services. The Company has a claims settlement mechanism based on the corporate-wide document “Methodical guidelines for handling nonconformities when selling OP, LHG and AG&S at filling stations.”
Gazprom Neft takes part in the trading of petroleum products on the Russian 
commodity markets as a mechanism to ensure fair and transparent pricing and sales of petroleum products. In 2013, the Company sold over 2.29 million tonnes of exchange-traded petroleum products, a year-on-year increase of 10%. The total exchange-traded sales of the Company in 2013 were 10.2% of the petroleum product output (in 2012 – 7.5%).PREVIOUS CHAPTER NEXT CHAPTER CONTENTS62

CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS
Corporate communications are a key mechanism of stakeholder engagement, which ensures the transparency 
and openness of the Company’s activities. The development of an internal communications system is critical for promoting corporate culture and maintaining a dialogue between management and employees.
Annual surveys, which monitor the corporate social and psychological climate, 
are used to shape the information content distributed via internal communications channels. The Company’s internal communications channels include: a range of corporate media, staff meetings with Gazprom Neft management, feedback tools, corporate activities and sports events, corporate parties, and competitions. The Corporate Forum is a flagship event within the Company’s internal communications program. It is attended by representatives across all of Gazprom Neft’s companies and groups of employees.
The corporate media channels include the official website of the Company and 
websites of its subsidiaries, the intranet portals of Gazprom Neft enterprises, Siberian Oil corporate magazine and the Neftegazeta periodical newspaper. This newspaper publishes both corporate-wide materials and information concerning particular enterprises and businesses.

is broadcast in all branches and subsidiaries. In December 2013, the project ‘Direct Line’ began on this radio station, where Vladimir Egorov, director-general of the company, answered questions from employees.
The Company actively uses a range of feedback tools to maintain a dialogue 
between management and employees. The Company has a corporate hotline and an ‘Ask Your Manager’ section on the intranet portals of the Corporate Centre and subsidiaries. In addition, information kiosks have been installed to collect questions for management from employees who have no access to the corporate network.
The key goals of the Company’s external communications are to strengthen 
a dialogue with outside audiences, promote its brand and provide information about its activities in the regions. The Company uses a wide range of tools and channels to communicate with outside audiences.The websites of the Gazprom Neft Group, combined in a single integrated system that gives increased access to information about the Group’s activities to all interested parties, are our most important communications tool. In 2013, Gazprom Neft’s website won the Business Website Design Award at  the 13th All-Russian Internet Contest “Golden Website”.
Following the principle of transparency, the Company informs stakeholders 
about all aspects of its operations. For example, in 2013, 141 official reports and 20 interviews were given by Company managers to the largest Russian and foreign business and socio-political media outlets were published on the Gazprom Neft website. In order to ensure better awareness of Gazprom Neft’s projects, press tours were organised to give journalists from various federal and regional mass media an opportunity to visit the Company’s production facilities in Russia and abroad.
In 2013, the Company continued to develop advertising campaigns in the mass 
media and provide sponsorship to the leading Russian sports clubs to promote the Gazprom Neft corporate brand.THE UNIFORM COMMUNICATION PLATFORM PROJECT, 
WHICH ENVISAGES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTI-SERVICE MANAGEMENT MODEL FOR GAZPROM NEFT CORPORATE PORTALS, WON A BEST INTRANET RUSSIA 2013 INTRANET-SOLUTION AWARD – IT WAS THE WINNER IN THE CORPORATE MANAGEMENT CATEGORY.

The average headcount increased by 2% in 2013 
year-on-year due to active staffing of both new and developing enterprises of the petroleum product supply and aviation fuel supply chains. The turnover rate was 18.9% (15.4% in 2012). The increase in the turnover rate in the Group was due to the restructuring of the petroleum product supply business (filling stations). As part of the restructuring, mass-scale organisational changes took place: the incorporation and liquidation of regional companies, territorial relocation of employees, and the reallocation of functions and activities among enterprises. These measures contributed to an increase in dismissals, leading to the turnover rate growth. Average number of employees in 2013, people

Gazprom Neft has an interregional trade union organisation that expresses 
the position of employees with regard to labour relations and the Company’s social and economic strategy. Gazprom Neft has a tradition of holding meetings for the heads of HR departments that are also attended by trade union leaders from the major Gazprom Neft subsidiaries. The participants discuss current issues in all areas of HR management, including the trade unions’ interaction with employees and top managers of the enterprises.
The mutual obligations of the Company and employees in respect of socio-
economic issues are reflected in collective agreements. The standard collective agreement defines the responsibilities of the employer and trade union organisations to ensure, monitor, and follow-up the occupational safety and health (OSH) measures and their efficiency. A special section of the agreement focuses on the areas of involvement for occupational safety representatives, members of OSH commissions (committees) and representatives of the relevant elected bodies of the primary trade union organisations in relation to the steps needed to create a safe working environment and prevent occupational injuries and diseases. The standard agreement regulates the balance between the interests of the employer and employees in the event of the Company’s reorganisation or reduction in the workforce and staff cuts. It also specifies the minimum notice 
time
22 prior to the start of relevant activities for notifying the respective employment 
agencies and the elected primary trade union organisation representative.
In 2013, as part of implementation of the unified system of social benefits, 
Company’s trade unions took an active part in the adaptation of the system at enterprises and the obtaining of feedback from employees.
The Company’s trade union organisations engage actively with young employees. 
Young specialists are involved in addressing issues related to improving working conditions, housing, and public services. Commissions established by trade union committees for working with young employees participate in developing and implementing programmes to help young newcomers adapt to working life and prepare programmes and proposals relating to the young employees’ interests; such initiatives are further taken into account when drafting the relevant sections of the enterprise’s collective agreements.COOPERATION 
WITH TRADE UNIONS
Gazprom Neft develops and implements social 
programmes in active cooperation with trade unions. Trade union organisations represent more than two-thirds of Company employees and participate in resolving professional and social issues, as well as those related to labour rights and employees’ interests.
22 At least two months before the start of the relevant activities, and if the decision to reduce

identify succession candidates were implemented in 
the Procurement & Capital Construction Direction, LRSS (oil refining), EPS (exploration, drilling, gas, geology and development, and large projects). CREATING A CANDIDATE POOL
The creation and development of a high-quality candidate pool is critical to achieving Gazprom Neft’s strategic 
goals. The Company is currently implementing and refining a system for high-potential employee assessment and selection and career planning to provide Gazprom Neft with the maximum level of skilled staff in the future.
Talent Committees are meetings where management teams consider 
the current situation regarding the key position candidate pool, elaborate action plans to ensure better staffing, approve lists of succession candidates and key/high-potential employees.

DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES
LABOUR EFFICIENCY MANAGEMENT 
AND PERSONNEL ASSESSMENT
The Company has an employee performance management system in place based on a set of indicators 
for different management levels and individual targets for each employee. 
Personnel assessment is an important component of 
the performance management system. Gazprom Neft first launched a regular employee assessment at the Corporate Centre in 2011. Regular assessment had been implemented in 18 subsidiaries and affiliates of the Company by year-end 2013. 
The assessment system envisages an annual 
employee assessment using professional, ethical and management-related criteria. The assessment results are taken into account when planning careers and employees listed in the candidate pool and influence salary revision and annual bonuses. An internal training course, ‘Individual Development Planning’, was set up for better utilisation of the assessment results by employees. The training aims to help employees plan their professional and career development.
In 2013, the Company was actively involved in 
enhancing its job applicant assessment system. Gazprom Neft developed its own ability tests in line with the Company’s specific activities. The uniform approach to assessing candidates is scheduled for implementation in six key subsidiaries in 2014. This will enable the Company to improve the quality of job applicant selection for key production assets. During 2013, the EPS of Gazprom Neft was implementing the Arrow project, aimed at improving the efficiency of the subsidiary management system. As part of the project, the Company standardised the system of employee key performance indicators to link it more closely the subsidiary development goals. PREVIOUS CHAPTER NEXT CHAPTER CONTENTS79

IMPLEMENTATION OF HEADCOUNT  
MANAGEMENT TOOLS
This initiative is designed to complete the enhancement of headcount management 
in order to improve labour efficiency and expenditure control. To address this task, a comprehensive Company headcount management model will be implemented, allowing for the calculation of short- and long-term headcount forecasts based on external and internal change factors.
In addition, in 2014, the Company will continue implementing regular employee 
assessment, rolling out the unified social benefit system across Gazprom Neft’s enterprises, and enhancing cooperation with educational institutions. PREVIOUS CHAPTER NEXT CHAPTER CONTENTS80 GAZPROM NEFT  2013 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT SAFE DEVELOPMENT: 
HEALTH, SAFETY 
AND ENVIRONMENTPREVIOUS CHAPTER NEXT CHAPTER CONTENTS81
www.gazprom-neft.comThe Company’s key priorities in the area of corporate social responsibility include occupational health and safety 
enhancement and the reduction of environmental impacts. The company is committed to constantly improving workplace and environmental safety, consistent with international best practice, and to making full use of innovations developed by Gazprom Neft businesses. 
In managing occupational risks related to impacts on 
employees' life and health, equipment, property, and the environment, the Company follows the principle: ‘No economic, technical or other considerations shall be taken into account at the expense of the safety of workers, the general community, or the environment.’
Gazprom Neft operates in accordance with 
the national policy requirements for health, safety, environment, and social protection (HSE and social protection), as well as with corporate and international standards.
The Company has a corporate Health, Safety, 
Environment, and Social Protection Policy (The HSE and Social Protection Policy). The Policy is pivotal to performance and improvement of the HSE and social protection management system that complies with OHSAS 18001:2007 and ISO 14001:2004 international standards and covers all Gazprom Neft production facilities.
A uniform integral indicator has been developed at 
Gazprom Neft to assess the operation of facilities in terms of key industrial and environmental safety, occupational health and safety, and civil defence indicators: accident and injury rates; implementation of programmes at subsidiaries covering injury prevention, fire, transport and environmental safety; and implementation of civil defence measures. The measurement results are taken into account when reviewing the annual performance of the Company’s subsidiaries.Cooperation with contractors on this subject is considered to be an important part of the Company’s HSE and social protection management system. According to the ‘Procedure for managing contractors and cooperative arrangements in the field of industrial, environmental and occupational safety, and social protection,’ compliance of contractors with the HSE and social protection requirements is an important pre-qualification criterion. All contractors who provide services to the Company sign an agreement on HSE and social protection that stipulates mandatory compliance with the Company’s HSE standards.
The HSE and social protection activities are integrated 
into the Company’s system of business planning and coordinated by the Occupational Safety Department at the Corporate Centre level. In 2013, the Company’s HSE and social protection service was reorganised to meet Gazprom Neft’s commitment to advanced management patterns. The new management structure provided the Occupational Safety Department with responsibility for determining the Company’s safety policy, strategy,  goals, and development priorities, as well as exercising control and interacting with third parties in this area in general. Conducting operational procedures and interacting with subsidiaries and affiliates to ensure efficient HSE and social protection activities is the responsibility of the EPS and LRSS.

GAZPROM NEFT  2013 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORTSAFE DEVELOPMENT: HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT
In the reporting year, scheduled work continued 
towards establishing an integrated HSE and social protection system and improving its efficiency. Enhancement of the system, development of programmes and projects on the basis of current situation analysis and subject to assessment of their efficiency were the main objectives towards this goal. In 2013, the practice of auditing HSE and social protection management systems at subsidiaries continued. Two audit checks of management systems (Omsk Lubricant Plant branch of LLC Gazpromneft-Lubricants and LLC Gazprom Neft Asia) and two enhanced technical audits (OJSC Gazprom Neft-NNG, CJSC Gazprom Neft-Terminal) were conducted. 
In 2013, Gazprom Neft updated the corporate 
standard ‘Company and Subsidiary Fire Safety Procedure’ and introduced a three-level Fire Safety Management System. This system is aimed at creating the conditions to ensure efficient fire prevention and control, employee health and survival and security of the Company’s property, as well as making the Company and its subsidiaries capable of responding to, and dealing with, fires in a prompt and efficient manner.
A new guidance document was developed in 2013 – 
“Recommendations on Establishing Basic HSE and Social Protection Regulations’. The document sets forth uniform workplace behaviour requirements to all employees in order to exclude HSE and social protection violations that could entail accidents and fatalities, and sets forth uniform workplace behaviour requirements to contractors/subcontractors engaged in operations at the Company’s enterprises. In 2014, the document will be implemented in all subsidiaries of the Company. Together with implementation of the recommendations, personnel will be trained via video records, literature and other means.In accordance with the commitment set out in the corporate HSE and Social Protection Policy, Gazprom Neft is aimed at building a safety culture based on personal responsibility, motivation and engagement in safety enhancement for both Company and contractor employees. Training Company and contractor personnel in HSE and social protection laws and regulations, corporate and international standards, is essential to achieve this goal.Gazprom Neft has developed a practice of regularly exchanging HSE and social protection experience both within the Company and with external organisations. The Company holds annual conferences on occupational safety.
In the reporting year, the Company held the first 
corporate forum on industrial safety: ‘Successful Business = Safe Business', covering implementation of the Basic Safety Regulations in the Company. 2014 was declared a Year of Environmental Culture and Industrial Safety in the Company, so the forum became the symbolic beginning of implementation of this initiative. The Company plans to continue holding similar forums on a regular basis.POLICY AND MANAGEMENT  
(CONTINUED)
In December 2013, Gazprom Neft’s Industrial Safety Department held an international workshop, ‘Industrial Safety Risk Assessment: Practice, Experience and Tools. Achievements and Challenges.’ The workshop was attended by the representatives of federal executive bodies, international oil companies and expert organisations. The workshop examined the OHS risk management experience of oil companies, risk identification methods, qualitative and quantitative risk assessment and manageability. The participants considered risk modelling when implementing oil and gas projects, including the assessment of technical and environmental risks in offshore oil and gas production. The workshop attendees also discussed the corporate standard ‘Procedure for HSE and social protection risk identification, assessment and minimisation’, updated subject to present-day risk assessment approaches and methods. This standard has been under development since 2013. In the reporting year, the Company held the first corporate forum on industrial safety: ‘Successful Business = Safe Business', covering the implementation of the Company’s basic safety regulations in the Company. 2014 was declared a Year of Environmental Culture and Industrial Safety in the Company, so the forum became the symbolic beginning of implementation of this initiative.

www.gazprom-neft.com
Analysis shows that the Company’s main occupational safety risks are associated 
with road traffic accidents, failure to comply with rules for hazardous tasks, and violation of the law and security rules by contractors. In order to minimise these and other human-factor risks in HSE and social protection, the Company has in place a corporate qualitative risk assessment-based standard, ‘Procedure for identification, assessment and minimisation of HSE and social protection risks’. Programmes to prevent injuries, as well as transport and fire safety programmes, are developed at the Company’s subsidiaries in accordance with this standard and the corporate integrated HSE and social protection risk management system. In case of an incident, the Company conducts an inquiry and develops and implements corrective actions. Information on incidents is communicated to all subsidiaries and contractors engaged by the Company and its subsidiaries so that preventive actions could be arranged.
Total expenditure on HSE and social protection initiatives in 2013 amounted 
to RUB 12,357,031 thousand (excluding joint and foreign assets). As a result of consistent performance in this area, accident and injury rates decreased in 2013.OCCUPATIONAL

Gazprom Neft runs an Integrated Environmental 
Management System that had a certification audit conducted in 2013 and was declared in conformity with ISO 14001:2004 international standard. Upon completion of the certification, the Company obtained:
 ISO 14001:2004 certificate with international accreditation by RvA, a member of IAF (International Accreditation Forum);
 ISO 14001:2004 certificate issued by IQNet (International Certification Network).
Subsidiary certification will be the next stage of environmental management development in the Company. In the reporting year, ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certificates were issued to Gazprom Neft-Sakhalin, integrated management systems of Gazprom Neft-Omsk refinery and Gazprom Neft-Moscow refinery were successfully audited for compliance with ISO 9001, 14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards. 
In 2013, the Company conducted a comprehensive 
environmental examination at Gazprom Neft-Omsk refinery and Gazprom Neft-Moscow refinery to assess the facilities’ industrial impacts on the environment, carry out an environmental audit and identify economic and environmental risks. Based on the resulting findings, the 2025 Refinery Environmental Development Programmes were devised. These programmes envisage a set of measures to reduce air emissions, ensure legacy waste and contamination management, bring the discharges into compliance with quality requirements, reduce water consumption and disposal, and enhance the environment management system.In 2013, Gazprom Neft-Moscow refinery among others was awarded by the Moscow Government within an environmental contest for its switchover to production of Euro-5 motor fuels. According to the contest panel, this fact enhanced the environmental situation in the city. The refinery started producing the new fuel in spring 2013, and in summer, all  Company plants switched to the production of Euro-5 fuel, 2.5 years ahead of the Russian Technical Regulations’ deadline. In addition, Gazprom Neft-Moscow refinery was awarded by the All-Russian Refining Association in the category "Best CIS Oil and Gas Refinery in 2013."

AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY  
OF ARCTIC SHELF DEVELOPMENT
As a result, an unparalleled high-tech complex was created based on the best 
drilling, liquid hydrocarbon production and transportation developments, and subject to the highest HSE requirements, including offshore exclusive standards. The Prirazlomnaya safety  programme addresses all possible ice, manmade and technological burdens.
Since the sea depth in the area of the field is relatively small, the platform 
is installed right on the seabed, secured by both its own weight (506,000 tonnes) and a stone berm. 120,000 tonnes of stone and gravel piled along the perimeter of the platform bottom also protect it from scouring.The design features of Prirazlomnaya fully exclude any oil spills and blowouts during oil production and storage. Production wells do not come in contact with water due to being located inside the platform. A zero discharge system is employed at the platform. The system excludes the possibility of drilling and production waste getting into the sea. It will be pumped into special absorption wells or, if necessary, collected into tanks and delivered to the shore for further disposal. Reservoir and oil-contaminated waters will be pre-treated and also fed into the well.
A wet method of oil storage is used at the platform. The method eliminates 
the possibility of oxygen getting inside the tanks and thus prevents the creation of an explosive environment.Shipment risks are also minimised to their lowest level. In order to pump the oil from platform oil tanks into oil vessels, special platform-based equipment for direct oil loading was developed. The loading block system goes off in seven seconds at most, making it possible to avoid accidental oil spills.
Before shipping, shuttle tankers equipped with a blow-loading system 
moor to the platform without contacting it. Oil vessels are equipped with dynamic positioning systems, which may anchor them despite the wind and wave loads. Super ice-class oil vessels with double hulls and a deadweight capacity of 70 thousand tonnes were specially designed for shipping oil from Prirazlomnaya.Despite the platform is well protected in case of any emergencies, a set of additional protection measures was developed to keep the staff safe as well as the environment and the platform itself, including a plan for preventing and eliminating oil spills.
Three multitask icebreaking vessels are on permanent duty near the platform 
to ensure year-round platform service, cargo delivery and rescue and salvage operations. The vessels are designed to resist high ice loads and equipped with up-to-date skimmers to remove oil spills both in open water and in ice.The Company began the development of the Arctic shelf by producing oil in the Prirazlomnoye field. 
The production platform was designed and constructed subject to the landscape and climate conditions of the region so as to minimise technological and man-made impacts on the environment.SAFE DEVELOPMENT: HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTPREVIOUS CHAPTER NEXT CHAPTER CONTENTS90

www.gazprom-neft.comAn automated emission monitoring system has now been installed at 
the Moscow refinery. Sensors installed on the plant’s funnels provide data on composition of emissions each 20 minutes and allow ensuring compliance with established standards. The data will be transmitted to the state environmental institution Mosekomonitoring. The system also collects data from diesel hydrotreatment, catalytic cracking, sulphur and bitumen production units. Implementation of an automated monitoring will enable the refinery to monitor in real time the compliance with standards and to enhance the air condition management at the factory’s site and nearby residential areas. In 2013, a reduction of pollutant emissions from APG flaring was due to the upgrade of APG flaring systems and their placement under a soot-free regime. Implementation of APG utilisation programmes enabled the Company to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to close out eight flare stacks as sources of air pollutant emissions. Due to implementation of these measures in 2013, the Company’s overall pollutant emissions decreased by 305,900 tonnes (up 28%) year-on-year. The APG utilisation level in the Company achieved 80% by year-end 2013 (up 14% year-on-year).

THE COMPANY HAS AN INDUSTRIAL WASTE MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM IN PLACE TO OPTIMISE WASTE STREAMS, REDUCE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND ECONOMIC COSTS. The Company implements its industrial and consumer waste management 
initiatives in accordance with Russian laws and regulations, regulatory and procedural guidelines, and international standards. 
The Company keeps prime records of waste, determines its properties and 
environmental hazard class, prepares hazardous waste datasheets, takes measures to obtain necessary permits, submits annual statistical reports on waste management and arranges for ongoing monitoring of waste generation and management, in accordance with the established procedure.
Gazprom Neft ensures the end-to-end servicing and management of its own 
industrial oil-waste landfills where environment contamination sources are monitored in accordance with dedicated survey programmes. Gazprom Neft employees engaged in waste management activities undergo special training for handling hazardous waste classes 1-4. The Company is implementing a programme to reclaim oil-polluted land at Gazprom Neft’s Moscow refinery. As part of this programme, work was carried out in 2013 to recycle oil sludge, eliminate the overflow pond and emergency pit, and to reclaim oil-polluted land at the facility and in the Moscow River water protection zone. Since 2013, the Moscow refinery has been implementing measures to remove decommissioned treatment plants, followed by eliminating oil-containing waste and remediating the released area.
In 2013, Gazprom Neft began to install special containers – eco-boxes – for the collection of hazardous waste (mercury thermometers, energy-saving light bulbs, and used batteries) at its filling stations in Saint Petersburg, as part of a sound waste management programme organised by the Saint Petersburg Committee for Natural Resources Use, Environmental Protection, and Ecological Safety.Average annual waste generation* , %

the mega-city. For example, measures were taken in 2013 to prevent petroleum products from entering the Moskva River: clay-cement grouting of river-bed soil was performed, geomembranes were created to protect ground waters against contamination, and rehabilitation of the buffer reservoir-adjacent area was completed. Gazprom Neft-Omsk refinery embarked on an acid sludge management project, followed by land rehabilitation. LAND USE AND SOIL RECLAMATION
THE COMPANY TAKES ANNUAL MEASURES AIMED AT CONSERVING AND RESTORING LAND RESOURCES. GAZPROM NEFT PAYS 
A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION TO THE REMEDIATION OF SLUDGE PITS AND LANDS AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. 
Remediation programmes include an inventory 
of these areas, assessment of soil contamination, and the selection and implementation of the best reclamation practices. The remediation process comprises measures aimed at removing damaged forest, collecting oil-containing liquid, performing technical and biological rehabilitation. The Company annually assesses environmental renovation measures that include chemical and analytical control of land rehabilitation supported by laboratory data.
In 2013, Gazprom Neft developed a dedicated 
programme to rehabilitate contaminated lands, sludge pits and treat oil-containing waste in 2014-2016. This programme envisages completing measures aimed at rehabilitating legacy sludge pits, taking a detailed inventory of oil-contaminated lands at fields that have not been examined before, and reducing the area of oil-contaminated lands within the specified timeframe.
As part of the set of land protection measures taken 
by Gazprom Neft, corrosion inhibitor protection is provided for all pipelines. The Company monitors the corrosion rate of pipelines and inspects their condition. A set of projects to diagnose and service pipelines reduces the number of pipeline ruptures and, therefore, the contamination of surrounding lands.

Reclamation of oil-contaminated land vs. 2012The Company relies heavily on innovations in land protection and rehabilitation. 
In 2013, along with scientists from the Lomonosov Moscow State University, the Company conducted research in two important areas:
 “Development of an aerobic-anaerobic technology for sub-surface bioremediation of oil-contaminated marshes in the Western Siberia.” This technology will prevent contaminated marsh soils from frequent loosening, while the efficient combination of simultaneous aerobic and anaerobic oil decomposition processes will accelerate the time of oil spill-affected marsh ecosystem bioremediation.
 “Development of an aerobic-anaerobic technology for bioremediation of industrial land deep contamination.” Due to the soil and ground absorbing capacity, production sites can store a considerable amount of hydrocarbons after available rehabilitation methods have been applied, thus entailing secondary ground water pollution. An alternative land clean-up method can comprise a technology for bioremediation of soil and ground residual deep petroleum-product contamination (after liquid petroleum products are pumped out) based on activation of chemical-driven aerobic-anaerobic hydrocarbon decomposition processes. 
In the long run, these technologies will save time and money spent performing reclamation work, while achieving better quality. Volume of oil-contaminated lands reclaimed, hectares

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION SEGMENT
Energy efficiency is a priority for oil companies 
that spend a great deal of opex money on electricity. The Exploration and Production 
Segment (EPS) energy-saving measures are 
mainly intended to reduce the energy-related component of the overall unit production costs incurred by EPS facilities.
The key energy-saving measures in the EPS facilities 
include:
 Use of energy-efficient electric centrifugal pumps;
 Introduction of valve electric motors;
 Optimisation of downhole equipment configuration and operation.
 Optimisation of pump operation at the booster pump stations and preliminary water discharge units;
 Optimisation of the power supply diagram, etc.
The main indicator of energy efficiency at EPS facilities is the specific energy consumption for the mechanical extraction of liquid. Consumption of purchased energy: Exploration and Production Segment, 2011–2013

REGIONAL POLICY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The regional activity management system extends to different functional 
levels of Gazprom Neft. The Corporate Communications Unit is responsible for the coordination of these activities. 
The Company has a special collegial body, the Regional Policy Commission, 
comprising representatives of business units of the Company Corporate Centre and subsidiaries. The Commission’s functions include collecting and considering suggestions on implementation of the regional policy from the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ business units that update and accumulate information on the needs of regions in social development projects, as well as preparing recommendations as to realization of such suggestions. Adopted resolutions and issues may be considered at meetings of the Company’s Management Board, if necessary.The Company chooses social investment objects based, without limitation, on the monitoring of social well-being, which includes surveys conducted by both the Company and independent agencies. In 2013, the Company carried out a study titled “Analysis of perception of the Company’s social policy and projects implemented in 2007–2013” relating to its activities in the YaNAD, KhMAD – Yugra, Omsk Region, and Orenburg Region. Based on the results obtained, it was decided in the reporting year to introduce a competition-based charity fund allocation system – a grants competition of social initiatives. Competing projects shall be proposed directly by social activists in the regions where the Company operates. The pilot grants competition was held in the Orenburg Region in 2013.
The introduction of new social policy tools required the Company  to develop 
the management competencies of the experts responsible for the implementation of the regional policy. In 2013, the Company conducted a set of training workshops with the participation of leading charity and social responsibility experts and the managers of public organisations.
In the reporting year, it was decided to introduce grants competitions as a new social investment tool within framework of the Home Towns programme. The pilot project has been implemented in the Orenburg Region comprising employees of local educational, healthcare, and cultural institutions and sports schools and centres. The Grants Panel composed of representatives of the Company, regional authorities, local mass-media, and social project planning experts, selected 12 projects out of 38 submissions, aimed to resolve key social challenges faced by the region. Total allocations for the approved projects amounted to RUB 1.6 million. These funds will be spent on creating an information centre within a library, opening a kids and teens drama school, developing a set of methodical textbooks for teachers in rural schools, and on other projects. In addition, winners were given advice on further implementation of the projects. Similar competitions are planned to be held in key regions of the Company’s operations since 2014. They will not only serve as an additional financial tool to support regions, but also as an innovative mechanism to address social issues. The project will enable the Company to both support programmes that are critical for the regions, and create new centres of social life for local communities. Later on, such centres may develop without Company's support, independently creating opportunities for improvement of life quality in regions.COMPANY AND REGIONS: STRATEGIC SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP

In 2013, as part of this project, four multi-purpose hockey rinks were built in the Novosergievsky, Orenburgsky and Perevolotsky districts of the Orenburg Region, along with a sports ground in the village of Ratta (Krasnoselkupsky district, YaNAD). In Omsk, three sports grounds and a sports mini-park were opened with the support of the Company. In 2014, more yard sports grounds are expected to be opened in the towns of Noyabrsk and Nadym and in the village of Krasnoselkup (YaNAD). In addition, covered sports grounds are scheduled for construction in the YaNAD (towns of Noyabrsk and Muravlenko, and the village of Khanymey of the Purovsky district).In 2013, the Company proceeded with the implementation of its inter-regional sports project, the Avangard Ice Hockey Academy, the goal of which is to establish a uniform hockey training system for children and youth in the Urals and Siberian territories that would comprise a branch network extending to different regions.
The system is aimed at creating a uniform teaching and training methodology, 
unifying student selection principles, implementing state-of-the-art athletic technologies, and integrating this sports initiative under a single umbrella brand. The centre of the Academy will operate in Omsk under the aegis of Russia’s leading hockey club Avangard, whose main founders are the companies of the Gazprom Group. The best students of the regional branches will have an opportunity to continue their training in the centre of the Academy in Omsk and later, in the Avangard’s club system.
Over the past seven years, the Gazprom Neft Cup has become the largest international 
children’s hockey tournament and a non-official championship in Russia among teams of children aged 11 and under. Today, the Gazprom Neft Cup is characterised by an unprecedented level of organisation among children’s competitions. Matches are scored by professional judges from  the Kontinental Hockey League, and games take place on ice rinks that are certified for matches of the League professional teams. The tournament is widely covered by leading Russian media companies; the opening of the tournament and the final match are broadcast live by KHL-TV (a TV channel of the Kontinental Hockey League).  
The number of applications for participation in the tournament is growing year by year. In the reporting year, the seventh tournament was held in Omsk, attended by 16 teams and more than 400 young players. Based on the results of the 2013 tournament, it was decided to increase the number of participant teams from 16 to 24 in 2014, break down the competitions into two divisions (“West Group” and “East Group”) and hold the games in two cities – Omsk and Minsk.

CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES 
AND VOLUNTEER PROGRAMMES  
In 2013, the Company adopted a Charity Concept aimed at enhancing the efficiency 
of charity programmes in its regions of operation. The Concept divides the charity activities into four groups: targeted corporate charity, give-and-take fund, corporate volunteering, and social initiatives grants competitions. All charity projects are implemented in accordance with the key segments of the Home Towns programme.
As part of its targeted corporate charity activities, the Company provides assistance to 
non-profit public organisations, charity funds, research, cultural, educational, sports and health care institutions, orphanages, and individuals. Charity funds are allocated from the Company’s budget based on the decisions of the Charity Commission.
The Gazprom Neft’s give-and-take fund is intended to provide material and 
organisational assistance to employees and their families in difficult situations. The Fund’s activities are based on the principle of co-financing by employees and the Company. More than 3,000 employees took part in the Give-and-Take Fund programme in the reporting year.
Blood donation and orphanage and boarding school support are key priorities for 
corporate volunteering. The Company has a tradition of organising Blood Donor’s Days, as well as campaigns addressing orphanages and boarding schools, such as “Letter to Santa”, “Prepare Your Child for School”, Children’s Day, “Sports Spring”. Within the framework of these campaigns, Company employees participate in the organisation and staging of sports, educational and entertainment events for orphanage residents and provide them with targeted assistance – for instance,  helping them get ready for a new school year and preparing New Year gifts.In 2013, Gazprom Neft employees took part in a new charity event, “Big School-Break”, organised by the Company together with the April Charity Fund. As part of the campaign dedicated to Teacher’s Day, Company employees organised enrichment activities for the residents of two orphanages in the Leningrad Region. The activities were based on the ages of the children. The junior group participated in game lessons, with youngsters taking part in Play Dough classes, learning to plant flowers, and so on. The older children took part in lessons and workshops designed to enhance their cognitive interest in such school subjects as physics and chemistry. The children also took part in drama classes. Professional orientation classes were arranged by the heads of Gazprom Neft business units, for senior students to help them decide on future profession. Based on the results of the 2013 campaign, it was decided to hold the Big School-Break campaign annually.Gazprom Neft’s approaches to organising charitable 
activities are determined by the Policy of Charitable Activities and the corporate standard Charity Support Procedures. 
>7,500  employees
Attended corporate volunteer events in 2013. The 2013 best volunteers were recognised with by thank you letters from Company managementIn the reporting year, Company employees took an active part in Gazprom Neft’s

The environmental flagship projects included a volunteer clean-up in Ekaterinhof Park in the City of Saint Petersburg, as well as the participation of Gazprom Neft employees in a municipal volunteer campaign – “Clean Banks for Water Bodies”, held in Tyumen.
Gazprom Neft’s contribution to community development is highly recognized in 
the regions. In 2013, Gazprom Neft-Khantos was honoured by the jury of the Yugra Black Gold district competition in the Most Dynamic VIC category. The enterprise was also named the silver winner in the “Social and Economic Cooperation” category among companies with more than 5 Mtpa output – and secured a Reliable Partner certificate for effective cooperation in the course of implementation of the Yugra public cultural policy.
