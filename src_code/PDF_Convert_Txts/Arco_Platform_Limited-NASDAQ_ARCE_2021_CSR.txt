THE RIGHT WA Y
TO DO WHA T WE DOANNUAL REPORT 20212Our society faced great challenges during 2020 and 2021. We had to adjust to the pandemics 
and social isolation, and we felt in practice the leading role that companies are assuming in an 
increasingly interdependent and connected society. 
We know that the indiscriminate pursuit of proﬁ  t should not be the only purpose of companies. 
We are responsible for generating a positive impact for all of our stakeholders and for the 
capacity to built relevant value for our entire chain. Arco was already built with the mindset that 
our growth will only be sustainable if we keep our customers at the center of all our decisions, 
constantly evolve our products and services, focus on our greatest asset - our people - and 
always act ethically and respectfully. These are the values that guide us and allows us to assume 
a leading room in a market with still so much room for growth. 
As an Education company, we recognize that we have an even bigger responsibility and that the 
only way to achieve and keep succeeding in the long term is by acting correctly. 
To start our ESG journey, we included all of our stakeholders in the construction of the materiality 
matrix, recognizing the relevance of an alignment between executives, clients, suppliers and 
investors for our strategy. As a result, our matrix reinforced themes that were already known to 
us as essential for our company’s success: we must keep promoting the impact on Education 
and focusing on our people throughout a strong and sustainable structure. In that 
way, it became clear that ESG is nothing more than the right way to do what 
we already do every day. 
However, we know that we are just in the ﬁ  rst day our ESG journey. 
For this reason, we have set priorities and goals until 2025 to 
guide our decision-making process on all the most relevant 
environment and social impact aspects of our business. 
This plan reinforces our public dedication to transform lives 
and society through Education. We thank every stakeholder 
who has been building Arco’s history together with us - 
our partner schools, which trust our solutions and brands 
to improve their performance, our employees, who work 
tirelessly to deliver our purpose, our sales team, which 
make it possible to deliver excellent content and relevant 
technology, and to our investors, who are partners in our 
company’s constant evolution. 
We’re just getting started!
Thank you very much,

WHA T WE DO
In 2021, we gave our ﬁ  rst step towards ESG. We built our materiality matrix together with the specialized consulting ﬁ  rm 
RPT.Estratégia, aligning the vision of our main stakeholders - employees, investors, suppliers, banks and NGOs -, and on 
the main topics that impact our business. 
Our matrix conﬁ  rmed the relevance of Impact on Education, Focus on People, and Strong and Sustainable Structure for 
our business and guided the company’s ﬁ  rst steps towards collection of indicators, deﬁ  nition of priorities and projects 
and communication both internal and externally.Arco was born with the mission to transform the way students learn by delivering high 
quality education at scale. We know that the only way to deliver our purpose and achieve 
the impact that drives us is to sustainably manage our risks and seize our opportunities on the 
environmental, social and governance fronts.

EVOLUTION IN LEARNING
Arco was born with the mission of delivering high quality 
education to millions of students in Brazil. 
For us, that means delivering an excellent content that ge-
nerates proven evolution in learning, development of 
the 21st century citizens, supporting our students to 
get into Universities and our schools to have excellent 
results in Education.
We are developing a learning evolution measurable tool 
that is comparable to industry benchmarks to quantify the 
impact of our solutions over student learning (to be com-
pleted by 2024). Our goal for 2025 is:In 2021, we’ve supported more than 13 thousand stu-
dents to be approved through SISU (Uniﬁ  ed Integrated 
Selection System), which uses the ENEM scores to enter 
the best universities in Brazil:

solutions that complement the 
education and build the citi-
zens of the future, developing 
socioemotional, bilingual and maker skills, as well as in-
clude 21st century skills in our core content across all 
disciplines. 
We are building a playbook that ensures our materials 
comply with the National Common Brazilian Curriculum

Empower young people to go beyond what they 
imagined possible through education
Arco Instituto was born with the mission of expanding our 
purpose and impacting students from different realities

we ﬁ  nd organizations that dream the same dream with us. 
We connect and boost social organizations that 
impact the youth, making them more mature and 
deepening its impact, offering:

OUR GOALS
To take care of our people, we focus on three main pillars: 
opportunities, development and recognition.
We understand the essential role that our culture and le-
adership play in recognizing our team and maintaining a 
high density of talents. Therefore, we invest in building a 
culturally strong environment, with rituals that allow the 
exchange of experiences and knowledge between our 
people, such as our joint reading moments, mentoring 
and follow-up routines between leaders and its teams.
For our leaders, we hold quarterly to align the main stra-
tegic guidelines of the areas and ensure that everyone 
is clear about our vision of the future. In parallel, there is 
also an improvement in the development path through 
exchanges and collaboration, with a focus on the perso-
nal and professional evolution of our leaders.
Our culture guardians program reinforces the importan-
ce of people who are reference in behavior and values. 
We believe that our culture is the best strategy to win the 
game, so we value every day-by-day action that is con-
nected to what we believe. Periodically, we provide mo-
ments with teams and leaders to discuss our essence and 
purpose, where we share stories and experiences that 
make our culture tangible on a daily basis.
For us, to build opportunities is to ensure that promotions 
and career evolutions are carried out fairly, based on an 
individual performance assessment, and considering 
cultural aspects and performance criteria, being carried 
out through 360° committees involving different areas 
and our senior leaders. Every six months, the individual 
performance assessment guides the construction of an 
individual development plan.In 2021, 100% of eligible people were evaluated in our 
performance management cycle and we promoted 33% 
of our people as a way of recognition and meritocracy.

relevant agents of this transformation by creating a spe-

OUR GOALSWe believe value is in all people. That’s why we cultivate 
the value of diversity and inclusion every day in the com-
pany.
We understand that by promoting a more diverse and in-
clusive environment, we create more engagement oppor-
tunities for our people, richer exchanges, higher levels of 
satisfaction and growth possibilities that pave the way to 
build better solutions to deliver our mission. 
In 2021, we’ve conducted an Arco Census to get to know 
our internal scenario and understand our strengths and 
points of development. Based on the results, we deﬁ  ned 
our priorities and goals for 2025:WHERE WHE ARE
We have an ethics channel that guides the actions and 
posture of employees and third parties in the daily situa-
tions in their work environment, and we refrain any une-
thical or fraudulent attitude.
We recognize the transforming role of Education in di-
versity. Therefore, we invest in diversity discussions with 
teams, fomenting joint reading moments over the theme 
and providing training materials and content to promote 
a welcoming and inclusive environment for all. 
Gender diversity:

between our women leaders, partners and

Racial diversity:
In 2022, we’ve launched a Racial Diversity Learning 
Group, with the purpose of expanding our people’s 
knowledge on structural racism and contributing to a de-
creased rate in discrimination. 
In addition, we are structuring listening moments with our 
black people, so we can build together strategies to leve-
rage the topic internally, developing solid and impactful 
actions.In this census, 7% of the respondents reported that they 
have already suffered and 9% have witnessed discrimi-
nation at Arco, a relatively low rate when compared to 
other organizations, where this rate varies from 10 to 15%. 
However, we believe that a healthy and sustainable cultu-
re can only be built with ethics and respect. Therefore, dis-
crimination is unacceptable in our company. One of our 
main goals until 2025 is:15ANUAL REPORTFOCUS ON PEOPLE IMPACT ON EDUCA TION STRONG AND SUST AINABLE STRUCTURE

ANUAL REPORT
1) VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT
Through specialized tools and market information, we 
conduct biweekly tests with the objective of evaluating the exposure of our environment to risks, making adjust-ments and corrections to mitigate the identiﬁ  ed vulne-rabilities of Arco’s environment. To measure this aspect, we’ve created an indicator called VRI (Vulnerability Risk Index
2), which measures the risk of these vulnerabilities. 
Today, we are around of 400-699 (medium risk) and we aim for the years to be below 300 (low risk). GENERAL DA T A 
PROTECTION LAW (LGPD)
We have adapted all our units1 to the General Data Pro-
tection Law during 2020 and 2021, ensuring a safer treat-
ment to the personal data that we have access, including the update ouf our Privacy Policy and vulnerability detec-tion processes. Our Data Security and Protection Commit-tee develop an important role by following the evolution of our processes in treating the data we have access.
We conduct trainings to our teams and partner schools 
about the relevance of the Data Protection Law, identi-fying potential risks in the treatment of personal data, and establishing an adequate data sharing ﬂ  ow. 
CYBERSECURITY
We have a dedicated information security team which has been working since 2020 on the implementation of our Arco’s Data Security Program, which is composed by structural projects and services to increase the protection of our environment and mitigating the risks of possible attacks. 
This team is also responsible for monitoring the routine 
of our tools and our Information Technology Security services. Ever since then, we have implemented the best practices in the market for the Information Technology Security in all our business units, using the security NIST framework and the ISO/IEC 27001, which guides practi-ces, controls and technologies to recover, identify, pro-tect, detect and respond to cyber risks. 
As of now, we have a 2.5 NIST Security Level and our goal 
for the year is to reach level 3, following the best Brazi-lian market benchmarks. In addition to following our NIST level, we’ve hired a consultancy specialist ﬁ  rm, Morphus, which supports us on two main fronts:
1.Our recently acquired business are being adequate to Arco’s Data security patterns. 2) The Vulnerability Risk Index was build through a specialized tool that uses a machine-learning 
based system to score the exposure of the cyber environment from 1 to 1000. The score is based on 7 indicators, weighted according to the risk of each: Common Vulnerability Score 
System, threat publication date, exploit publication date, asset criticality, asset location, impact on the company’s environment, vulnerability dissemination.400

OUR ST AKEHOLDERS VISION
I used SAS learning system over the last four years. SAS not only prepared me 
for the ENEM, but also helped me to get a seat in the college of my dreams, 
as it provided speciﬁ  c questions of the entrance exam in the same style of the 
test. The content in the books is the best and most complete I’ve ever seen. 
Without a doubt, SAS was essential for me to be able to be ranked in the third 
place in the course of my dreams! 
- SAS Student
I have always dreamed of being part of this team. I’m proud and excited to 
continuously evolve here! 
We’re on the right path as a team. We have a lot of autonomy in my business 
unit.
Arco has made great progress regarding its communication with investors 
over the last year. We’re pleased to see the ESG commitments that it have sta-
blished.
Arco has come a long way since the IPO. I’m excited to keep following its jour-
ney towards increased transparency. Thanks!“
