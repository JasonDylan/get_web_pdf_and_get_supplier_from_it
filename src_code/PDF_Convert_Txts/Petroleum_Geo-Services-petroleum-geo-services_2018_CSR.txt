2Dear PGS shareholder 
The price of oil has driven significant changes in the marine 
geophysical industry, and PGS has responded with some radical 
changes, based on a leaner, more financially resilient organization. 
Long-term, however, the underlying problem of finding and producing enough 
energy to power the world has not gone away. Our customers are focusing on 
finding oil and gas again, although cost still remains their lodestar. Meanwhile 
we are getting to grips with a whole new way of working. 
While energy markets and stock prices fluctuate, our core values do not. We will 
continue to deliver excellent projects as we look to the future, and will continue 
to behave in an ethical, safe and responsible manner in our dealings with our 
colleagues, our customers, the environment and the communities where we 
operate. That is a tough commitment in tough times. This report documents  
how we performed against our goals last year.
As ever, I welcome feedback and ideas from our stakeholders. I look forward  
to hearing from you.

Stakeholders Environment People ConductWe remain committed to the ten principles of the United Nations Global 
Compact in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anticorruption. 
For the second year in a row, our corporate responsibility report is shaped by the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) introduced by the United Nations in 2015. 
Last year we analyzed the SDGs in light 
of our strategic priorities. Our analysis 
presented us with an opportunity to align 
our own responsibility goals with the  
global sustainable development needs.  
The priority areas are highlighted in the  
top right corner of the graph below.
This year, we re-evaluated the materiality 
of each goal and priority area to us as a 
company and to our stakeholders. Our value 
chain, the context in which we operate, and 
our core values have guided our analysis. 
That evaluation led us to introduce an 
additional SDG: Decent work and economic growth. We believe that we can contribute 
towards the advancement of this goal, 
especially when it comes to promoting 
productive employment and decent work.
This years’ report includes a description 
of the measures we have taken to reduce 
the risks and improve the opportunities 
associated with the SDGs listed above, 
whilst balancing the expectation of our 
stakeholders. In the years to come, we will 
continue to link the relevant SDGs to our 
business development, risk management 
and strategy processes.About this Report// About this Report

7Focus Areas
Working in the New Organization
Since 2008, PGS has monitored the satisfaction, 
motivation and loyalty of its employees through a 
biennial global people survey. To gauge the effect 
of the 2018 reorganization on employees, the 
management team elected to carry out a new 
survey just 12 months after the last. 
Monitoring differences in motivation and 
satisfaction and managing meaningful 
improvements are key reasons for conducting 
a global people survey. Overall findings were 
reported to the corporate management, while 
detailed reports were distributed to line managers 
enabling them to plan how to address any issues 
raised with their teams.
Employee participation in this year’s survey was 
92%, which is an all-time high. Broad participation 
is important to the validity of the results and the 
effectiveness of actions generated.
Participation is voluntary and anonymous. Over 
the last few years, PGS has used the Ennova 
Employee Index (EEI) as a benchmark; this index 
is widely used around the globe. The survey aims 
to answer two central questions:
How satisfied, motivated and loyal is a  
given group of employees?
How does a manager create satisfaction, 
motivation and loyalty in this group  
of employees?
Overall Trends
Despite the significant recent organizational 
changes, the employee engagement results are 
stable, and loyalty, especially, is still strong. In 
fact, PGS results on this score remain strong 
compared with the oil and gas benchmark group. 
Scores for immediate manger are also high.  
However, there are variations and signals that 
we still have a way to go in some parts of the 
organization before we can put the change 
process behind us. The solid trust demonstrated in the scores for 
immediate manager and loyalty show that PGS 
has a good base to work on going forward. 
Next Steps 
The initial report is a positive testament to the 
willingness of PGS employees to give honest 
feedback. This is further demonstrated by the 
high response rate. 
The most important part of the survey process 
will be the analysis and action conducted locally. 
Management at all levels will engage with their 
employees to understand and act upon their 
unit’s results. 
PGS will continue to build and nurture teams, 
developing the skills and alliances that are 
required to make the organization a success and 
focusing on our strategic goals. We continue our 
commitment to communicating and listening,  
of which the survey is one important element.
Empowering People
Technology is a core asset to PGS, also when it 
comes to people management. As employees’ 
needs evolve, so do our systems, increasing our 
efficiency. This year, we introduced an improved 
people management system that allows us 
to adapt the way we perform human resource 
processes to our overall business needs, which  
is paramount in a changing organization. 
The new system empowers our people by 
giving them better access and control of 
their personal information and development, 
through a new set of tools and functions. New 
human resources dashboards allow managers 
to perform more sophisticated analyses of 
their teams’ performance and progress, to help 
them be better leaders. This should allow both 
managers and employees to focus on activities 
that are most relevant and best-suited to them, 
advancing productive employment. // People // Focus Areas
// PGS Responsibility Report 2018
8Protecting Health, Safety and 
Security for Our People
Streamlined Strategy for HSEQ
The company reorganization inspired us to 
streamline our approach to Health, Safety, 
Environment and Quality (HSEQ). We evaluated 
our HSEQ objectives and restructured them to 
maintain and modernize our “no compromise” 
safety culture while ensuring continued 
compliance in all aspects of HSEQ. The three main 
pillars of the new, simplified HSEQ strategy are: 
Exposure reduction – identify, develop and 
implement technology and ways of working 
that eliminate or reduce exposure to health, 
safety and security risks, environmental 
impact and quality failures.
Culture development – institutionalize a 
self-sustaining culture of safe behavior and 
quality, driven by openness of reporting, positive 
intervention and learning from every incident 
and lesson identified.
Digital transformation – implement  
modern digital tools, systems and ways  
of working that improve risk awareness and 
management while minimizing bureaucracy 
and administrative burdens.
The revised strategy will be implemented 
company-wide during 2019.Health Risk Assessments and Medical
Emergency Preparedness
Last year, we continued our efforts to strengthen 
our medical expertise and provide our people  
with an advanced medical support system,  
with evacuation and repatriation services. 
We develop a Medical Emergency Response Plan 
(MERP) for every work location and transit route. 
The MERP provides steps for the movement of 
an ill or injured person from the moment they 
leave our vessel, through the nearest level of 
upgraded care, to a definitive medical care facility.
In addition, we conduct a Health Risk Assessment 
(HRA) prior to every project in high-risk areas. The 
HRA determines the risk level of the upcoming 
operation and the exposure to potential and existing 
medical and/or work environment health hazards. 
Together, the HRA and the MERP ensure that we 
have proactive management of health risks and 
an efficient and reliable response is provided in all 
cases of medical emergency offshore. This allows 
us to evacuate a crewmembers from anywhere in 
the world, provide them with a high standard of 
medical care, and get them home safely.Focus Areas// People // Focus Areas

10Our offshore crew have been taking part in an 
initiative to stay active, as part of their annual 
performance indicators. This year’s objective has 
been to improve fitness and health awareness 
by keeping track of all physical exercise onboard.
Our crews embraced the initiative and achieved 
an average participation rate of 52%. On average, 
each participating crewmember spent 3.5 hours  
a week exercising.The medics have been actively involved in the 
initiative, acting as trainers, encouraging the 
crew, and organizing different workout events. 
Basketball games, tournaments, cardio sessions 
and strength training classes are just some 
examples of the activities that have been taking 
place on our vessels.Encourage Active Empoyees// People // Case Study

11PGS is proud to pioneer new technologies, 
especially when innovation and technology 
underpins our endeavor of improving the safety 
of our offshore personnel. 
We are currently supporting the development 
of an exciting idea from Dimeq AS, a Norwegian 
digital maritime equipment company. It is one 
that aims to digitalize and improve safety at 
sea. Their product makes it easier to monitor and 
supervise offshore personnel in emergencies. 
This personal device is worn on the wrist by all 
crewmembers, and is capable of continuously 
tracking* all individuals onboard a vessel in 
real-time, from embarkation to disembarkation. 
The system is activated in situations such as 
an evacuation, fire or man-overboard, including 
drills would and used to locate and account  
for individuals.“Mustering and keeping track of crew during 
emergencies on board is very important, and 
equally challenging. This technology will make 
this part of handling an emergency situation 
a lot easier, ” says Captain Roger Honningdal, 
Operations Risk Manager
By allowing the developer to test these devices 
onboard one of our seismic vessels, and supporting 
their ideas with our operational experience, we can 
see how this innovative idea works in the field. If it 
performs well in practice, we hope it can improve 
the standard of safety for our industry.Emergency Bracelets// People // Case Study

eSeismic – A New Way of Acquiring 
and Processing Seismic Data
A novel acquisition and processing method is 
currently under development in our research and 
development unit. The eSeismic method utilizes 
a source that outputs a continuous low level 
signal, as opposed to the impulsive signal from 
traditional seismic arrays. Existing equipment 
can be used to generate this signal, making the 
method immediately available for validation.
Measurements from a test survey done in Brazil 
proves that the sound pressure level (SPL) is 
reduced by about 20-22 dB, and the sound exposure 
level (SEL) is reduced by 8-9 dB. This contributes to 
further reduction of the risk of disturbance to life  
in the oceans from our operations.
We also anticipate significant benefits in 
terms of acquisition efficiency. By completing 
a survey faster, we can reduce the time we 
spend in any given area. This is both a benefit 
to the environment, and also reduces the risk 
of interfering with the activities of other users 
of the same area, like commercial or artisanal 
fisheries. Benefits will come from wider coverage 
per sailline and slightly higher vessel speed.
Coexistence with Fisheries
Across the globe, commercial use of the oceans 
is increasing. Whenever multiple parties are 
working in the same area, this brings challenges 
in terms of simultaneous operations and risk 
of interfering with each other’s activities. 
Coexisting with fisheries has always been a 
priority for us. However, as commercial and 
artisanal fisheries have increased in both 
intensity and scale, we decided to critically 
review how we manage this challenge and  
how we can leverage new technology.In 2018, we have been looking at all phases 
of managing coexistence with fisheries, from 
planning of our surveys, consultation and 
socialization, detection of fishing vessels and 
equipment in the field, to optimal use of support 
and escort vessels to communicate and engage 
with those around us in the survey area.
One key objective we identified was the 
improvement of our scouting abilities out on the 
oceans, to ensure we are aware of all vessels and 
fishing equipment located in the area. You can read 
more about a project to develop drones to enhance 
these capabilities in the Stakeholders section.
Global Sulphur Cap 2020
As of 2020, the global cap for sulphur content in 
marine fuels will be 0.5 % necessitating use of 
low-sulphur fuels or abatement technologies for 
continued use of heavy fuel oils. During 2018, our 
maritime department has analyzed the options 
for our fleet and operations, in light of the 
anticipated availability of fuel beyond 2020.
On some of our vessels, we have decided to install 
scrubber systems progressively towards 2020. 
The remainder of our fleet will switch to low 
sulphur fuels, in compliance with the global cap 
and any applicable local regulations. Minimizing 
consumption of fuel across our fleet remains a 
priority, with several ongoing initiatives in our 
maritime and technical departments. In sum, this 
will enable us to maintain a competitive fleet that 
is fully compliant with environmental regulations 
and in line with our environmental commitments.
// PGS Responsibility Report 2018
15Feasibility, Funding and Pilot Test 
In 2017 , PGS launched a concept for collecting 
plastics at sea that uses the inherent capabilities 
of seismic vessels. We then commissioned a 
desktop review by an independent consultant of 
the potential and feasibility of the concept, using 
funds received from the Norwegian development 
and investment bank ‘Innovation Norway’ .
The results of the feasibility study were 
published in Q3 2018. The report concludes 
that pelagic micro plastic densities are too low 
for surface plastic collection to be efficient on 
the open ocean, but densities may be higher in 
certain areas or during certain seasons, or during 
flush-out events. A review of synthesis and 
modeling studies identified areas where plastic 
could be available in high densities, due to the 
likelihood of high input flows from runoff and rivers during wet seasons. These include the Gulf 
of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea and the West Coast 
of Africa around the north Atlantic Margin.
PGS is now progressing with a more detailed 
technical study that will include theoretical 
engineering and hydrodynamics considerations. 
Discussions are ongoing with potential partners 
and suppliers for the boom arrangement, bubble 
curtain and collection unit.
Our next step will be to seek funding to conduct 
a full-scale pilot test offshore, over a period of 
approximately two months in either the Atlantic 
or the Caribbean. Academic institutions will 
be invited to join us, using our vessel for the 
duration of the pilot to conduct relevant research 
on plastic pollution in the oceans.Plastic Initiative// Environment // Case Study

Our 
Goals
Our global footprint requires us to maintain a constant focus on 
ethics and anticorruption. In 2018, we continued to advance just 
and strong business relations and practices, and promote these 
through our own exemplary conduct, and interactions with our 
partners and contractors.
Personal Data and Information Security
PGS has always taken its responsibilities 
seriously with regard to management of 
personal data. Under the new EU General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) our responsibility 
for personal data covers all systems that store 
information about employees, suppliers or 
customers. “Whenever we process Personal Data 
for employees and customers, we need to ensure 
their privacy rights are protected, ” explains PGS 
Global Data Protection Officer Daphne Bjerke.
Over the past two years, we have conducted a 
project to check that our systems and processes 
comply with the new requirements. A GDPR 
workgroup was established in 2016, including 
representatives from HR, Legal, Compliance and 
IT. Well within the deadline set by the European 
Union, we reviewed and revised all of our systems 
and met all the standard requirements to protect 
the personal data and privacy of our people  
and stakeholders. 
We updated our internal data privacy requirements, 
which provide a guide to the collection, use, 
transfer (including transfer across international 
boundaries), release, disclosure, and security of 
Personal Data. These requirements also describe 
our expectations for third parties who process such 
data on our behalf. All the relevant information for 
PGS and our subsidiary companies is gathered in a 
newly created manual on personal data protection 
and binding corporate rules.We established a GDPR hotline and a personal 
data protection website, available to all 
employees who have questions or believe  
might be affected by violations.
Anticorruption Effectiveness Survey
During the past five years, all PGS managers and 
employees have participated in anticorruption 
training. All have been through the e-learning 
program and those who are particularly exposed 
have been given annual in-person training.
This year, we included a set of anticorruption 
questions in our Global People Survey. The 
results will help us evaluate how successful 
our compliance awareness initiatives have 
been and where we should focus our efforts to 
improve further. Improvement initiatives include, 
among other things, mandatory e-learning for 
all employees, targeted in-person training for 
exposed people, and intranet articles.
Improved effectiveness of background checks  
of agents and intermediaries
One improvement initiative in 2018 was to 
concentrate the task of performing integrity 
due diligence of our candidates for services such 
as intermediary, in-country representation and 
business development. By forming a competency 
group performing these tasks, we are convinced 
that our scrutiny will further improve, and as a 
result our exposure will be further reduced.
// PGS Responsibility Report 2018
17PGS has operated an external hotline service for 
reporting and investigating undesirable incidents 
since 2004. The PGS Compliance Hotline is an 
early warning system that reduces risks. It is part 
of a range of measures that foster high ethical 
standards to maintain employee, customer and 
public confidence in PGS. 
In 2018, we changed the provider and updated 
the functionality of our Compliance Hotline. 
The new service is run by WhistleB. It is entirely 
web-based and user-friendly. State-of-the-art 
security ensures GDPR compliance, encryption 
and password-protection functionality. 
We replaced the old call center system, because 
research shows that people now preferred a web 
interface to talking to strangers about sensitive issues, and they may not be comfortable talking 
on the phone in a foreign language. 
The new solution can be accessed via the 
internet from a smartphone, tablet or PC, 
anytime from anywhere in the world.
Anyone can report cases or suspicions of 
misconduct related to PGS. It is available for 
anybody who has concerns about actions or 
incidents involving PGS that are not in line with 
our values, violations of laws and regulations, or 
other ethical concerns that may seriously affect 
our organization or a person’s life or health. For 
employees, it provides an additional safety net 
and a route for dealing with issues that cannot 
be solved through the line.

Listening to our Customers
Emerging from the most significant restructuring 
exercise in our company’s history, we reached 
out to our customer base to hear their views 
on the exploration and production challenges 
they are facing and how they expect marine 
seismic subsurface information provided by the 
likes of PGS to help them overcome some of 
those challenges. The output from such a dialog 
with customers was expected to support the 
development of PGS’ corporate strategy around 
a customer-centric vision. In-depth interviews 
were conducted with 39 senior contacts from  
the geophysical and exploration departments  
of client companies. 
The interviews confirmed that our customers’ 
buying behaviors have changed in a world of 
decreasing or flat budgets. PGS is however 
described overwhelmingly as a leader in marine 
seismic acquisition and is widely recognized as a 
technology-focused company that has advanced 
the industry as a whole through the launch of 
GeoStreamer, for example. We are rated highest 
for our technology, HSE and delivery of reliable 
(acquisition) services. 
The interviews however also highlighted a need 
to take the relationship with our customers 
beyond the functional by demonstrating that we 
care and understand their needs and challenges.
The overall feedback will inform our overall 
company strategy and provide a steer to the 
way we will promote our company identity, and 
how we will structure our customer engagement 
going forward.
Account Management in PGS
As part of the company reorganization we 
introduced a new customer account management 
system. Sales managers are assigned a defined 
responsibility for specific customers and given a 
company-wide sales remit for PGS services. 
Aside from the business benefit to PGS, there 
are many advantages for our customers. Instead 
of separate business units selling acquisition, imaging and MultiClient data, our major customers 
now have one point of contact for all three service 
areas. The account manager has the flexibility 
and knowledge to weave together new business 
offerings formed from a complete, value-based 
solution. Leveraging the account managers’ 
network throughout the PGS organization will 
provide customers with a more responsive, 
proactive and relevant commercial partner.
Global account managers are responsible for 
leading global account business development 
for our 12 largest customers. This includes 
development of key relationships, fostering PGS 
connections, as well as building and delivering 
sales strategies for global customers. The 
global account managers promote competitive 
advantages across the business. They also 
provide advice to local sales teams building 
greater customer insight and understanding.
Managing Investor Relations 
High standards of transparency and equal 
treatment of all stakeholders are essential 
when disclosing stock market sensitive 
information about PGS. We use a variety of 
channels to engage with investors and keep them 
informed of company developments, including 
Quarterly results webcasts and  
conference calls
Quarterly senior management roadshows
Presentations and investor meetings at 
investor conferences
One-on-one meetings at our offices
All PGS information considered material to the 
capital markets is published via the Oslo Stock 
Exchange’s distribution site www.newsweb.no 
and also posted on www.pgs.com. The Investor 
Relations pages on our website provide financial 
and share information, announcements, archived 
press releases, presentation, and more.

Managing Risks in our Supply Chain 
Our suppliers are evaluated through a rigorous 
qualification, monitoring and performance 
system that ensures their conformance to our 
code of conduct and standards on integrity, 
corruption, health, safety, and human rights.
All new and existing PGS suppliers are scored as 
part of our supplier risk process. This allows us 
to apply adequate control and management for 
companies within the various categories. Risk 
scoring and mitigation measures make it possible 
to manage the overall risk level of our supplier 
base. All suppliers are scored on five key elements: 
HSE risk, quality risk, criticality and procurement 
risk, performance and management risk and 
financial strength and reputation history risk. 
We monitor and update the overall supplier 
risk matrix following regular meetings with 
the involved parties. Related actions include 
supplier relationship management processes, 
supplier audits, due diligence reports and 
technical meetings. 
For certain categories of suppliers, we also 
perform additional corruption risk assessment and 
anticorruption due diligence prior to establishing a 
business relationship. These procedures are applied 
to the following types of business partner:
All types of agents (including ship and sales agents), 
representatives, lobbyists and intermediaries
Sales consultants
Suppliers of armed guard services
Other suppliers of services and products 
requiring significant interaction with 
governmental authorities
Joint venture partners
Target companies for investment,  
acquisition and merger 
Other business partners or transactions  
that may expose PGS to corruption riskQualification of Ship Agents
Globally, our acquisition projects and port calls 
depend on services delivered by ship agents. 
All ship agents are evaluated through a due 
diligence process, including:
Supplier anticorruption questionnaire
Check of professional and personal references
Check for corruption allegations
Check through web-based tools
Evaluation of response, documentation  
and results 
Education in PGS’ anticorruption program  
and main anticorruption laws
Issue of due diligence summary report
Our analysis and investigation in the due diligence 
process are guided by the rating of the country 
where the supplier is located in the Transparency 
International Corruption Perception Index.

21ECHO Project — Houston// Stakeholders // Case Study
// PGS Responsibility Report 2018
22Our Houston team had a tough year in 2017 , from 
flooding, devastation and personal challenges 
related to Hurricane Harvey, an industry decline 
that affected their community, and then workforce 
reductions within our own company. Inevitably, 
morale took a dent. To reenergize and refocus 
the local workforce, they started the ECHO 
program: Enhancing Culture and Heightening 
Opportunities. It started with wellness. ECHO 
channels self-improvement and learning 
initiatives, volunteering opportunities, and social 
networking. With no extra dollars available, 
it’s almost all based on volunteers making the 
most of the funds at their disposal for health 
improvement and social activities. Packaging this under the ECHO umbrella maximizes the 
empowerment of the volunteers who organize 
the activities, and the boosts the motivational 
benefit to employees.
Some of the initiatives launched or in the pipeline: 
ECHO wellness fair, Christmas party planning, 
discount cards promoting and supporting local 
businesses, family day. There are plenty of other 
ideas too.
This engages and enhances our employees’  
self-development by involving them in 
volunteering programs/local charities and 
supporting local businesses.ECHO Project — Houston// Stakeholders // Case Study

24Fish aggregating devices and debris can cause 
great damage to PGS in-sea equipment. Faster 
detection and mapping of these obstructions 
can improve operational safety, avoiding impact 
or collision. It is also important to minimize 
damage to fishing vessels and equipment, as 
loss of fishing income would have a negative 
impact on local communities. 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly 
known as drones, are quickly becoming a regular 
tool in the maritime industry. Advanced drone 
technology can now provide a bird’s eye view 
of the area of operations, from over 30 km, 
to enable hazard avoidance and monitor the 
presence of fishing vessels and gear. 
PGS is participating in the MarLander research 
and development project, co-financed by the 
Norwegian Research Council MAROFF program. 
Major contributors in the project include Maritime Robotics AS, the departments of 
Marine Technology and Engineering Cybernetics 
at the Norwegian University of Science and 
Technology (NTNU Amos), the Norwegian Clean 
Seas Association for Operating Companies 
(NOFO) and Equinor. The main aim is to develop 
a system for safe take-off and landing of 
small fixed-wing UAVs on offshore ships. PGS 
is facilitating field testing onboard one of our 
support vessels.
By improving aerial surveillance from vessels of 
various sizes to detect surface objects such as 
debris and fishing equipment, the MarLander 
project has the potential both to improve safety 
for PGS operations and also for local fishing 
communities, who are often otherwise unaware 
of the hazards and underestimate the danger of 
being close to seismic equipment.Detecting with Drone Technology// Stakeholders // Case Study

25// Looking Ahead
Looking Ahead
In 2019, we will focus on delivering the fastest turnaround in 
the industry by using unique PGS technologies, and we’ll be 
exploring the potential of digitalization to find better solutions to 
our clients’ business needs. Technology innovation will continue 
to be an important differentiator for PGS as we believe it will 
deliver cost and competitive advantages. Improved technological 
solutions will also continue to provide environmental benefits, 
such as further reducing energy consumption across our fleet.
Delivering projects faster must be achieved 
without injuries and incidents. The health and 
safety of our workforce and of those involved 
in our operations will remain our first priority. 
We will continue to offer safe, fulfilling, and 
productive employment to our employees.
Our core values will not change. We will 
further evolve our anticorruption program, 
and continue to conduct our business openly and transparently. Monitoring and mitigating 
business integrity risks will remain a major  
focus for us. 
Not least, we strive to maintain the trust of 
our stakeholders, and to build trust with the 
communities where we operate by creating a 
positive impact in these societies.
