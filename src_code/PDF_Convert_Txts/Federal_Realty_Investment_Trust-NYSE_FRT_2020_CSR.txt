Our CEO
GRI 102-14 2020 was a year that 
challenged our team and 
every aspect of our business 
in ways we could not have 
imagined when the year 
began. The unprecedented 
operational, public health, and 
economic challenges from the 
COVID-19 global pandemic 
were further complicated as 
protests against systemic 
racism emerged across the 
country and extreme weather 
events brought on by climate 
change threatened lives and 
properties. Never has the 
necessity of a sustainable and 
resilient business been more 
clear than in 2020.

GOVERNANCE
For more than half a century, this company has 
been built with long-term sustainability and 
resilience in mind, while also remaining nimble 
enough to react to changes. The fact that we 
have been able to increase our dividend for 53 
consecutive years through all types of conditions, 
including COVID, is evidence of the resiliency of 
our business.
Because a focus on sustainability in its broadest 
sense is ingrained in the DNA of this company, 
our team, and our way of doing business, we 
were able to adapt to the rapidly changing 
conditions in 2020. In the pages that follow, 
you'll see some of the specific actions we took 
in 2020 to support our employees, our tenants, 
and the communities where we operate. Suffice 
it to say that the events of 2020 proved more 
than ever that our business is resilient and 
that we are all part of a global community, 
with each of us needing to do our part to meet 
the environmental, social, and governance 
challenges ahead.
Last year we used this report to provide an 
overview of how we think about sustainability 
and the kinds of things we do in our business 
to improve the environment and support our 
employees, our tenants, and the communities we serve. Despite the challenges of 2020, we 
continued executing our overall ESG strategy 
with such notable accomplishments as achieving 
LEED Gold certification on our building at 
909 Rose Avenue in our Pike & Rose project, 
achieving a FitWel certification for our new 
corporate headquarters space that we occupied 
in August of last year, and aligning all of our 
ESG efforts with the UNSDGs to maximize 
their impact. We’ll provide more information 
throughout this report on our ESG efforts in 2020 
and our plans for the future.
One thing that will be more evident in this year’s 
report is the rigor and seriousness with which we 
approach our ESG mission. We’ve aligned this 
report with the Global Reporting Initiative to 
provide a better understanding of the impacts 
we have on the economy, the environment, 
and society in general, and to enhance our 
accountability for and transparency into our 
contributions. We’ll also provide more insight 
into the formalization of many parts of our ESG 
initiatives to improve the accountability of the 
company and our team members, including 
setting specific electric and GHG emissions 
reduction targets.
We’re pleased to be able to provide you 
with this report highlighting our ESG journey 
and accomplishments and look forward to 
continuing to share that journey with you in the 
years ahead.

In the U.S., 2020 was largely defined 
by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
civil unrest to raise awareness of 
racial injustice. As a company, we  
took actions to address both.Highlights of some of the actions we took are 
described on the following pages.

Justice
As racial justice protests 
swept the country in 2020, we 
were reminded that saying 
our properties serve their 
local communities isn’t just a 
catchphrase for us. 
It is a fundamental tenet of how we 
approach our business and supporting 
our communities during civil unrest was 
one of the best ways for us to live up to 
that core belief. While many property 
owners took action to keep protest 
activities away from their properties, 
we worked cooperatively with protest 
organizers to host events at a number 
of our properties and serve as meeting 
points for marches. Those actions were 
supplemented by internal awareness 
efforts. We supported our team 
members’ contributions to charitable 
organizations that championed causes 
related to racial injustice, raising more 
than $50,000, while sharpening our 
focus on our own efforts around issues of 
diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Integrity has been and continues to 
be a core company value because 
doing the right thing, even if it’s 
hard, leads to better long-term 
results. Integrity at Federal includes 
being fair and respectful, valuing 
diversity, and embracing what 
makes each of us unique. The ideas of diversity, equity, and inclusion were 
purposely embedded into our core values when 
they were adopted in 2016 because they are 
fundamental considerations for every part of our 
business and in everything that we do. In 2020, we 
formalized our commitment to diversity, equity, 
and inclusion with our CEO's signing of the CEO 
Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge.

points of view, different life experiences, and different expectations so those differences can fuel the 
healthy debate that’s needed for the long-term success of the company. But it can’t stop there. To have 
impact, it also requires that everyone in those diverse groups be treated fairly and have a meaningful 
voice in the discussion.

We think about diversity in 
our offices in much the same 
way we think about our real 
estate—it’s local and needs to 
reflect the local community. 
We purposely locate our offices at our 
properties because we want our team 
members to live and participate in 
the communities our properties serve. 
Our expectation is that the gender, 
racial, and ethnic makeup of the team 
members in our offices should reflect 
the gender, racial, and ethnic makeup 
of these communities. In our corporate 
headquarters at Pike & Rose and our 
West Coast headquarters at Santana 
Row, housing approximately two-thirds 
of our employees, the diversity of our 
team aligns with the diversity of the 
local community.
More detail on the diversity of our  
entire workforce can be found in  
the Team Information appendix .

/  18 FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST / A SUSTAINABLE CULTURE: 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTAlthough there’s always room 
for improvement, our Board of 
Trustees, executive leadership 
team, and Investment Committee 
include diversity by gender, race, 
and ethnicity.
As we think about further improving the diversity 
of our workforce, we’re focused on identifying 
and eliminating any structural biases in our 
company and in our processes that could inhibit 
our ability to recruit and hire a diverse group 
of employees. We’ve already implemented a 
version of the so-called “Rooney Rule” for all 
positions at a director level and above. We also 
provide hiring managers with resumes where 
any information that could identify a candidate 
by gender, race, or ethnicity is removed to avoid 
initial bias. 
As we enhance our efforts, we’re looking to:
 Address initiatives that expand recruiting 
sources to cast a wide net for new employees
 Update processes to ensure diverse 
candidates are proportionally included at 
each phase of the process
 Craft job descriptions to avoid inherent biases
 Identify jobs that are suitable for ongoing 
remote work to mitigate the physical 
boundaries that come with requiring a person 
be in a particular office every day
These  efforts, along with anticipated and 
ongoing training, will help us address any 
company-specific issues that inhibit diversity 
and help us reinforce that diversity is a core 
part of our values.BOARD OF TRUSTEES

each employee holds an important

We have a centralized team of HR professionals 
that oversee all compensation, promotion, hiring,

It extends to how we invest in our real estate. 
We’ve partnered with Primestor Development to own and develop properties in areas 
of Los Angeles County that serve primarily Black and Latino communities. Primestor 
is a full-service real estate company that focuses on economic development within 
underserved and marginalized communities and we partner with their diverse team 
of professionals who live in these communities to lease and operate the properties. 
We have committed to invest an additional $2 million to a Primestor-managed real 
estate fund whose purpose is to invest in projects located in urban, low- and moderate-
income, predominantly Latino markets. Our partnership with Primestor provides the 
needed expertise to extend our investment reach to these historically underserved 
and marginalized communities. The perspectives we gain from our partnership with 
Primestor are invaluable, so much so that Arturo Sneider, the co-founder of Primestor, 
is a full voting member of our Investment Committee, giving us the benefit of his unique 
perspectives on all our investment decisions greater than $1 million.

PROPERTY HIGHLIGHT
Freedom Plaza
Freedom Plaza is a 113,000 square foot shopping 
center located in the Watts neighborhood of 
Los Angeles , an area best known for the 1965 
race riots. Today, 87% of the population within 
one mile of the property identifies as Hispanic 
according to Trade Area Systems. Completed 
in 2020, Freedom Plaza includes a Smart & 
Final grocery store and other nationally known 
tenants such as Nike, Starbucks, Ross, Blink 
Fitness, and Habit Burger Grill. Prior to the 
opening of the Smart & Final grocery store, this 
area was designated by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture as an “urban food desert” – meaning 
that there were at least 100 households more 
than half a mile from the nearest supermarket 
with no vehicle access.
Primestor had been working on this project for 
nearly a decade , seeing the site’s potential for 
development as a way to create more economic 
opportunity and jobs for local residents. 
Investing in this project alongside Primestor 
gave us the opportunity to advance societal 
considerations in a financially responsible way. 
More than $50 million has been invested in 
this project by us, Primestor, the tenants, the 
Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles and 
through the New Market Tax Credit program.The impacts of this property are already being 
felt in the community . Residents of the area are 
now able to walk to a store to get fresh, quality 
food to feed their families. Local employment 
has improved. The tenant leases require 30% 
local hiring and as of July 2020, 78% of all 
workers at the property were from the area 
with nearly half of those workers categorized 
as disadvantaged: either a single parent, 
homeless, receiving public assistance, or lacking 
a high school diploma or GED. The economic 
impact this property will ultimately have on the 
community is yet to be seen, but it serves as an 
example that financially responsible investing 
can also support societal objectives.

Our primary assets are our land  
and buildings and we hold these 
assets for decades . This is why our decisions around what assets 
to buy, how a building should be designed 
and constructed, and what’s necessary to 
keep a building in good repair and relevant 
have to be made with a focus on the right 
thing to do for the long-term. 
We have long recognized the need for us to 
lessen the impact our business has on the 
climate, and over the past decade we have 
made significant investments in our real 
estate that have reduced and will continue to 
significantly reduce that impact over time.Solar Smart Flower, Assembly Row | Somerville, MA

Greenhouse Gas Emissions
We have been making decisions and taking actions for years that help mitigate the greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from our buildings and operations, and are now setting a formal GHG emissions reduction target. 
We have established our baseline utilizing guidance from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Corporate Standard, 
applying the operational control method to establish organizational boundaries, and have chosen to set 
a like-for-like reduction target. 2019 was chosen as our baseline year because it reflects the last full year of 
normalized operations not impacted by COVID-19 shutdowns.

have additional systems under construction 
with the expectation that we will continue to 
install these systems where feasible. The solar 
electricity generated at our properties is used 
to power our common areas, sold back to the 
grid to aid utilities in achieving their renewable 
energy goals, and sold to such tenants as  
TJ Maxx, Nordstrom Rack, and Target to power 
their stores and help them achieve their own

Our Approach 
to Managing 
Climate Risk
With property location being so impactful, 
choosing the right properties to add to our 
portfolio is critical.  We have a thorough due 
diligence process for all new acquisitions 
that we use to identify physical and 
transitional risks and quantify the potential 
impact of those risks on our business. That 
process utilizes our own knowledge as well 
as the knowledge of expert third parties 
who can provide us with a more in-depth 
understanding of the intensity of future 
physical risks.
Governance 
Our Board of Trustees has direct oversight 
responsibility for our ESG matters, including 
climate change, through its Nominating 
and Corporate Governance Committee 
(Nominating Committee). The Board and the 
Nominating Committee are provided with 
quarterly updates on all ESG matters and 
climate-related risks. Internally, our CEO is 
ultimately responsible for our ESG efforts with 
day-to-day management of ESG overseen 
by our Executive Vice President-General 
Counsel and our Head of Sustainability, with 
support from key department heads and 
an interdisciplinary council of employees 
representing different functional areas, 
different offices, and different demographics. Strategy
Our portfolio is located primarily in seven 
major geographic areas. We currently use 
FEMA's National Risk Index for Natural 
Hazards (NRI) to identify the primary historical 
climate-related risks in each of those areas. 
The NRI provides information at a county 
level, allowing us to identify risks more 
specifically by property in each geographic 
area. The identified climate-related risks are 
being incorporated into our operating and 
investment plans for our assets to position 
them to be resilient in the face of those risks. 
Risk Management
Assessing risk is a continuous process 
throughout the lifecycle of our assets. We 
assess climate-related risks as part of 
our review and approval of acquisitions, 
developments, and other investments 
greater than $1 million. The potential 
financial impact of any identified risk and 
any necessary remediation measures are 
incorporated into our financial evaluation 
of the investment. For our operating assets, 
climate-related risks are evaluated at least 
annually and addressed as necessary in the 
annual operating plans for each asset. We 
also consider climate-related risks in our 
evaluation of whether to sell an asset.
/  38 FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST / A SUSTAINABLE CULTURE: 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT TRANSITIONAL RISKS
 Building code, zoning codes, and other 
regulations related to utilities and energy 
efficiency may result in an increased cost 
of development and operations for our 
properties. We maintain local awareness of 
changes that are incorporated into planning 
to manage these risks.
 Utility rates continue to change due to 
climate-related events and initiatives to 
address climate change. We regularly 
monitor changes and adjust operations and 
procurement strategies. We also maximize 
energy-efficient designs and materials in  
our developments, redevelopments, and 
property operations. 
 Our properties could become less successful, 
which would impact the value of the 
company, if we did not provide the types 
of environmental and social features that 
tenants and the local community want in a 
retail or mixed-use environment.
PHYSICAL RISKS
ACUTE
 Increases in severity and frequency of storms 
could, over the long term, result in increased 
capital costs for damage repair and/or 
retrofits to properties to make them more 
resilient, as well as increases in insurance 
costs. In the short term, we do not have 
meaningful exposure to geographic areas 
that are highly prone to significant and 
severe storms for this to be a material issue. 
CHRONIC
 Rising sea levels could have significant 
impact on any of our properties that are 
within close proximity to waterways or other areas subject to storm surge. This could 
result in property damage, interruptions to 
business operations, and an increased cost of 
insurance. We currently have limited exposure 
to rising sea levels; however we consider this 
to be a long-term risk and are evaluating 
the risk at individual assets and potential 
mitigation strategies. 
 Increasing temperatures could lead to a 
need to retrofit properties’ HVAC systems 
to accommodate increased heat load. It 
could also lead to increased droughts and 
decreased available water supply. We are 
evaluating strategies to mitigate impacts on 
our properties, with a particular focus on our 
California assets.
OPPORTUNITIES
RESOURCE EFFICIENCY
We continuously seek to improve our resource 
efficiency at our properties to reduce operating 
costs, improve property value, and mitigate the 
need for future costly investments. 
ENERGY SOURCE, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES
We are increasing our use of green power 
through our comprehensive energy procurement 
strategy and through more on-site solar power 
generation, reducing our reliance on the grid 
and offering a way for our tenants to use 
renewable power at our properties. 
MARKETS
We maintain geographic diversity which 
mitigates the potential for any one particular 
climate-related risk to have a material adverse 
impact on our business as a whole.

With 93% of our employees headquartered in one of 
our regional offices, the most impactful training for our 
team comes from frequent and invaluable interactions 
between more senior team members and employees at 
every level and in all departments.
Our team members have the opportunity to join our CFO on a call with 
a key investor, participate with one of our experienced leasing agents in 
an important lease negotiation, or engage with our internal investment 
committee to understand the key considerations for capital allocation. 
Those practical experiences prepare our team to quickly assume roles 
with higher levels of responsibility. We actively encourage other forms of 
self-directed training through our tuition reimbursement program and our 
“Learn at Federal” training platform. We also offer employees time and 
expense reimbursement to participate in and present at industry-related 
educational seminars. Our investment extends to technology for our 
employees to use and develop new skills. These technology investments 
improve work experience by allowing employees to focus their efforts on 
the intellectually challenging and motivating aspects of their job instead of 
tedious, routine tasks, and provide more flexibility and work-life balance.
/  44 FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST / A SUSTAINABLE CULTURE: 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTWe prioritize the health of our employees by offering benefits and activities that 
promote physical and mental well-being. 
The focal point of those activities is our annual 
week-long health fair that gives our employees 
access to basic health screening tests, free flu 
shots, and other health-related information, as 
well as our gym and fitness class reimbursements. 
Through our Step Up with Federal program, we’ve 
partnered with Givhero to give our employees a 
way to improve fitness through counting steps 
and turning those steps into dollars donated by 
Federal to charitable causes. 
Our focus on the health and well-being of our 
employees extends to our office environments 
where employees spend meaningful portions 
of their working days. With the relocation of 
our corporate headquarters to Pike & Rose in 
2020, we now have 82% of our office-based 
employees working at one of our mixed-use, 
walkable properties  where they can access 
public transit, food, activities, and services 
without getting into a car. They also enjoy 
inviting public spaces where they can relax and 
recharge at any time during the day. We’ve 
focused on creating a healthy, welcoming, and 
productive environment for our teams; 90% of 
our employees occupy spaces built since 2014.  Our investments include ergonomically-
designed desk chairs and adjustable-height 
desks to give employees more control over 
the way in which they work while in the office. 
With the opening of our new corporate 
headquarters, 65% of our office-based 
workforce are in buildings that have LEED Gold 
certification , with all the health and wellness 
benefits that come with such buildings, 
including improved lighting and air quality, 
which are critical as employees return to work 
post-COVID. We want our employees to thrive 
and investing in their work environment is one 
way to help them on that path.
To protect the health and safety of our team 
members returning to work in our offices, we 
enacted a wide range of protective measures. 
We are now preparing for more of our team 
members to return to our offices post-COVID 
and are working with offices, departments and 
individual employees to provide continued work-
from-home flexibility. Continued protection of the 
health and safety of our teams returning to the

All proposed capital investments in excess of $1 million, including acquisitions, 
developments, redevelopments, and leasing capital, as well as all dispositions, are 
presented to our internal Investment Committee for review and approval. 
Our eight-person Investment Committee is comprised of our CEO, President and COO, CFO, General Counsel, 
our regional presidents, our SVP of acquisitions, and Arturo Sneider, president of Primestor, with each person 
having one equal vote. The diversity of our Investment Committee members and their respective experiences 
and disciplines provides a full range of relevant considerations for each investment decision. Investments 
approved by the Investment Committee that exceed certain size thresholds must be submitted to the full 
Board for approval. The supporting package that is prepared for review by the Investment Committee and/or 
the Board includes a description of the request, detailed financial analysis, the ESG considerations related to 
the request, and an evaluation of major risks and potential opportunities.
/  52 FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST / A SUSTAINABLE CULTURE: 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTOne of our four core values is Integrity, which reflects the expectation of the 
highest ethical behavior from the company and all trustees, employees, and other 
representatives in all aspects of our business. 
Our Board has adopted a Code of Conduct that applies to every trustee and employee and addresses 
things such as conflicts of interest, prohibition on bribery, fair dealing with third parties, and protection of 
Federal’s assets. An additional Code of Ethics was put in place by our Board to specifically address our most 
senior officers as it relates to professional integrity and appropriate controls with respect to all our financial 
reporting. Each year our senior officers acknowledge their agreement to be bound by that Code of Ethics. 
Employees and other parties with whom we do business can use our whistleblower hotline to anonymously 
report any violations of the Code of Conduct, Code of Ethics, or other behavior that may not be appropriate. 
Our General Counsel has direct oversight responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Code of Conduct 
and Code of Ethics and reports directly to the chair of the Board’s Audit Committee on any violations.
We also expect our vendors, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to act with the highest degree of 
integrity in their businesses. We’ve adopted a code of conduct  for these groups that specifically lays out our 
expectations for their general business practices, their policies towards working conditions, human rights, and 
their environmental impact. The policy provides information for how to report any violations, including the 
ability to report anonymously using our whistleblower hotline. Ethics and Compliance

Federal does not make contributions of any kind to any federal  
candidates or campaigns. 
The company does, however, periodically authorize contributions to state and local candidates and to 
promote ballot initiatives that support our business objectives in a particular locality (subject to applicable 
laws and after obtaining necessary internal approvals). In addition, the company belongs to various trade 
associations that may engage in federal and local lobbying activities. We do not control those activities in 
any way; they are generally undertaken for the benefit of the industry and all members as a whole. We may 
from time to time lease space in our properties to candidates or campaigns solely for use as an office with an 
express prohibition against holding any political activities at the property.
Our employees are encouraged to engage in the political and governmental process; however those 
activities are considered personal, must be undertaken on the employees’ own time, may not involve the use 
of company resources, and may not interfere with or disrupt our business. Employees are provided with paid 
time off to vote and in 2020 we provided a paid day off for employees to volunteer in the election process.Information Security
Political Contributions  
and ActivitiesOur information systems were designed with the objective of allowing employees 
who were out of the office for business travel or otherwise to be able to work as 
seamlessly as possible as and when needed. 
That required a keen focus on protecting the safety and security of those systems. It is why we were well 
positioned to transition our workforce to remote work quickly and securely when COVID-related lockdowns 
began in March 2020. To provide further protection for our systems, we instituted multi-factor authentication 
in 2020 for all means of access into our systems. We have also put in place systems and processes for secure 
file sharing to minimize the potential for any breaches involving sensitive data and personally identifiable 
information. We regularly test our systems and employees to be sure everyone maintains a sense of 
heightened awareness of cyber security threats. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our 
cybersecurity efforts and receives quarterly reports from management identifying the risks to the company, 
how those risks are being managed, and any breaches that may have occurred. As an additional precaution, 
we maintain cyber insurance to cover certain types of cyber-related breaches.
/  54 FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST / A SUSTAINABLE CULTURE: 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTIn a recently conducted ESG 
materiality assessment, responsible 
corporate governance was 
consistently ranked by stakeholders 
as a top priority.
Our corporate governance policies and 
practices are intended to provide the decision-
making and behavioral framework that is 
needed to promote long-term value creation, 
properly manage short- and long-term 
business risks, and provide transparency and 
accountability for all our stakeholders.
Topics found to be important to our 
internal and external stakeholders based 
on our materiality assessment conducted 
in 2020 were: 
 Sustainable investing
 Environmental factors contributing to 
operational excellence
 Health and safety
 Diversity, equity, and inclusion
 Maintaining strong corporate governance 
and ethical standards. 
The findings from this assessment will help us 
prioritize our ESG efforts and further engage 
staff, tenants, and investors on these topics in 
the future.Materiality

Management’s Assertion Regarding Green Bond Proceeds
Federal Realty Investment Trust $400 million 1.25% Notes Due 2026*
Net Proceeds from Sale of Notes $ 394,214,221
Federal Realty Investment Trust’s management is responsible for the completeness, accuracy and validity of 
the Green Bond Use of Proceeds Statement dated March 31, 2021. Management asserts that $310,800,000 of 
the net proceeds from the October 8, 2020 issuance of 1.25% Notes Due February 15, 2026 were used to fund, 
in whole or in part, the Eligible Green Projects, as defined below, included on the Green Bond Use of Proceeds 
Statement as of March 31, 2021.
“Eligible Green Projects” means (i) investments in acquisitions of buildings; (ii) building developments or 
redevelopments; (iii) renovations in existing buildings; and (iv) tenant improvement projects, in each case, 
that have received, or are expected to receive, in the three years prior to the issuance of the notes or during 
the term of the notes, a LEED Silver, Gold or Platinum certification (or environmentally equivalent successor 
standards). Not all projects, in whole, are LEED certified, rather, in some cases, only a portion of the project 
has been deemed LEED certified. As of March 31, 2021, two projects were LEED certified in whole (the Montaje 
Building at Assembly Row and the Canopy Hotel Building at Pike & Rose). An additional project (the LL Bean 
Building at Pike & Rose) was LEED certified for core and shell (excludes tenant related build out costs).
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, is a voluntary, third party building certification 
process developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (“USGBC”), a non-profit organization. The USGBC 
developed the LEED certification process to (i) evaluate the environmental performance from a whole-
building perspective over a building’s life cycle, (ii) provide a definitive standard for what constitutes a 
“green building,” (iii) enhance environmental awareness among architects and building contractors, and (iv) 
encourage the design and construction of energy-efficient, water-conserving buildings that use sustainable 
or green resources and materials (see www.usgbc.org for more information).

the potential issues and create appropriate remediation 
plans if we choose to proceed with the investment. We 
have detailed databases of environmental conditions at 
our properties that are used by our teams to ensure that 
we mange environmental risks appropriately. Ultimate 
responsibility for compliance is under our General  
Counsel's office.
