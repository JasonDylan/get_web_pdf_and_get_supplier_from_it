Chairman and CEO 
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented 
unprecedented challenges to the world. While the pandemic has posed many threats to the travel industry, it also gave us a chance to show our strength and leadership across the value chain. Trip.com Group Limited (“Trip.com Group” or the “Group”) has allocated significant resources to support its partners in industry revival efforts. As travel resumes, we have developed tools which provide timely updates on restrictions, outbreaks, cancellation policies and other relevant information to prospective travellers to help them prepare and make safe travel decisions. 
We are very proud of our employees’ dedicated efforts 
in maintaining quality services and ensuring user safety during this period. In addition to delivering the best-in-class experience to users, we understand that it is equally important to ensure we have a positive impact on local communities. As we have seen a shift in demand from outbound travel to domestic travel, we took the chance to further support local businesses by driving mutually beneficial partnerships with them. 
Moving forward, Trip.com Group will continue to 
strengthen partnerships across the value chain to deliver best-in-class travel experiences, and shape a sustainable tourism industry.

GROUP’S CORE 
VALUESBusiness Ethics
The Audit Committee on the board oversees business 
ethics in our company. Trip.com Group adopts the 
“zero tolerance” principle to any unethical behaviour. 
We provide detailed guidelines that demand all 
employees to comply with. Our Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics and Integrity Code of Conduct 
define the types of conduct which are strictly 
prohibited and clearly inform all employees that they 
are required to abide by the guidelines.
Anti-Corruption
In Trip.com Group, we strive to create and sustain a 
culture of integrity, prohibiting any form of bribery 
or corruption. Our Anti-corruption Management 
Guidelines detail anti-corruption principles and 
specify the behaviours that employees should not 
violate, including improper practice for personal 
gains, violation of internal rules and regulations, and 
acting against the Group’s interests. The guidelines 
also provide definitions of bribery, corruption and 
facilitation payment. All employees are required to 
conduct all interactions at work in an honest and Trip.com Group’s  Core Valuesethical manner
. Additionally, training courses are
available for our employees on the Trip.com Group
University online platform. All staff, including
employees, interns, trainees and part-time workers,
are required to take Code of Business Conduct and
Compliance training and exams once a year, which
include anti-corruption as an important topic. Product
partners, commercial partners, and all other business
partners are prohibited to offer gifts, commissions
or any forms of bribery to our staff for commercial
benefits.
We have a formal anonymous whistleblower system
with legal protection. The policies are available in
Chinese and English. Our Anti-corruption Management
Guidelines also specify different channels for
employees at all level to report violations or suspected
violations and raise concerns of any improper
behaviours. To encourage and assist whistle-blowers to
raise grievances without fear of reprisal, all disclosures
are treated confidentially and submitted to the Internal
Audit Department for further investigation.We have an internal monitoring system to detect 
corruption. The Internal Audit Department is 
responsible for: i) strengthening the employee 
awareness of ethic standards and integrity behaviours 
in workplace, ii) identifying and reviewing reported 
violations, iii) leading the investigations for any 
suspected cases of corrupt practices, iv) reporting to 
the Board of Directors and the audit committee.
During the reporting year and to the best of our 
knowledge, there were no confirmed cases of 
non-compliance with the relevant anti-corruption 
regulations that have a material impact on the Group.

With the COVID-19 outbreak, the travel industry was one of the first sectors to be affected. Small and medium-
sized enterprises, which accounts for a large proportion of global tourism operators, are particularly vulnerable. 
Recognising the urgency to mitigate socio- economic impacts on affected communities, Trip.com Group led initiatives 
to support and revitalise local business partners since the early stages of the pandemic.

Our employees are our greatest asset contributing 
to the continuous growth and development of our business. We are committed to providing a diverse, inclusive, safe, harmonious and industry-leading work environment to enable all employees to reach their full potential as they “Make Every Trip Effortlessly Enjoyable”. In 2020, we were awarded as the Employer of Choice by American Universities’ China Association.
Working Conditions
Trip.com Group is dedicated to building a team of over 28,000 professionals where our employees feel supported and motivated. All matters pertaining to human resources systems including recruitment and retention, remuneration and reward, compensation, dismissal, working hours, equal opportunity, diversity, training and development, and other benefits are handled according to the Employee Handbook. In recognition of the importance of diversity and inclusion for all current and prospective employees, our Equality and Diversity Policy stipulates guiding principles in prohibiting discrimination in the recruitment process or at the workplace on the basis of sex, pregnancy, marital status, family status, disability, and race. Currently we are employing around 160 people with disability. The Group is pledged to support the Women's Empowerment Principles established by the United Nations (“UN”) Global Compact and UN Women. To support our pregnant employees, we adopt a wide variety of benefits and enact measures including the provision of transportation reimbursements, maternity benefits, recliners and breast-feeding rooms. Our employees are rewarded with competitive remuneration based on factors such as average salary standards, professional competence and work performance. We conduct formal performance reviews for all employees aligned with career development twice a year. Our performance-based incentive pay structure covers all employees. We provide a range of attractive benefits such as medical care, maternity and child welfare, travel benefits and a range of leave entitlements. We provide non-compensation benefits to all employees based on the relevant laws and regulations of local markets. In addition, we pay social insurance premiums for all our employees in China as part of our statutory obligations. We also provide collective agreements to most of our Shanghai-based employees, which accounted to over 40% of all Ctrip and brand Trip.com’s employees.
Maintaining effective employer-employee 
communication is key to a positive work environment. We adopt various communication channels such as a monthly HR Open Day, suggestion mailbox, departmental meetings and bi-annual company-wide satisfaction surveys. Through these engagements, we gather feedback from our staff with regards to their interests and identify any potential improvement areas.
During the reporting year and to the best of our 
knowledge, there were no reported cases of non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations that have a material impact on the Group relating to compensation, dismissal, recruitment, promotion, working hours, rest periods, equal opportunity, diversity, anti-discrimination, freedom of association, other benefits and welfare including maternity and paternity leave, safe working environment, protecting employees from occupational hazards, and preventing child and forced labour.

some of which include:
• Enhance our cleaning protocol
• Implement flexible work practices, such as remote working or working from home
• Provide surgical masks and disinfectant to staff
• Measure the body temperatures of our staff to monitor their health conditions
• Encourage our staff to avoid commuting during rush hour
• Attend virtual meetings instead of face-to-face meetings as far as practicable

healthy for our employees. Our Employee Handbook 
stipulates appropriate occupational health and 
safety guidelines to protect our staff, from health 
and safety risks. The Group takes measures for 
heatstroke prevention and cold protection in line 
with seasonal changes. We provide medical insurance 
and free annual health check-ups for eligible staff. 
High temperature allowance during summer is paid 
for employees according to government regulations 
in China. We also conduct regular fire drills at our 
offices. During the reporting year and to the best of 
our knowledge, there were no reported cases of non-
compliance with applicable occupational health and

Driving Responsible Tourism Across Our 
Value ChainPromoting An Eco-Friendly 
Travel Culture
Contributing to environmental protection is 
important in the pursuit of sustainable development. To this end, we focus our efforts on promoting sustainable tourism and implementing carbon reduction measures.
We have identified that there are no significant risks 
relating to environmental regulation compliance which may impact the Group’s operations. During the reporting year and to the best of our knowledge, we complied with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements regarding environmental protection and there were no non-compliance cases relating to air and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, discharges into water and land, and the generation of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.
Promotion of Sustainable Tourism
Promoting sustainable tourism requires collective actions from industry partners, users and other stakeholders. Recognising the importance of our roles in advocating sustainable tourism, we partner with different organisations to implement environmental initiatives. The Group’s two subsidiaries, namely Trip.com and Skyscanner, became founding members of a sustainable tourism campaign “Travalyst”. Currently, the campaign is developing sustainability frameworks to serve as a guide for scoring sustainability practices across the travel and tourism industry. Skyscanner is developing an aviation sustainability framework which creates greater transparency around carbon emissions for individual flights and highlights the sustainability practices of different airlines.

Energy Conservation
Strong sense of environmental responsibility is
demonstrated through upholding resource efficiency in
our operations. Considering our business nature, our
carbon reduction measures focus mainly on improving
energy efficiency at our headquarters. Designed as a
green building, our headquarters was certified LEED
(“Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design”)
Gold level with several implemented environmental
initiatives including the application of an intelligent
building energy management system. Besides that, we
have replaced all obsolete lighting fixtures with LED
lamps which have helped reduce our annual electricity
consumption by approximately 519,000 kWh. In
addition, we affix “Turn off the light” stickers near the
switches to remind staff of switching off lights before
leaving the rooms.Reducing Environmental Footprints in Our 
Data Centres
The Group is mindful about the environmental 
footprints from our data centre operations. To 
maximise energy efficiency in our data centre facilities, 
we procure equipment such as cooling towers, water 
pumps and chillers with a minimum of China Energy 
Label Energy Efficiency Index Level 2. Our data 
centres adopt natural cooling method in centralised 
chillers during winter or suitable temperatures. In 
addition, energy efficiency features such as adjustable 
floor are adopted in our cold aisle containments. These 
methods help reduce significant amount of power 
consumption during the cooling process in our data 
centres.

Green Office Culture
It is of equal importance to encourage environmentally conscious behaviours at 
the workplace. To strengthen our green office culture, we carry out “Green Plan” covering different aspects in workplace. These practices help to instil an eco-mindset in our employees and foster a sustainable company culture. For instance, we have procured several eco-friendly stationeries for our staff. The pens that we purchased are mostly made from paper materials with “Less Plastic More Green” printed on the barrel, resulting in 80% plastic reduction compared to regular pens. Sealing tapes are customized with calcium carbonate materials which are degradable. We have also set up recycling bins around office buildings and encourage staff to donate their unwanted household goods such as old clothes, books and toys. In addition, we encourage employees to prepare environmentally friendly tableware instead of using deposable chopsticks.

philosophy to “be an excellent corporate citizen in 
the world”, we have been carrying out charity work 
in many countries around the world. Our “Transport 
Public Welfare + Poverty Alleviation through Tourism” 
scheme provides travel packages which aim to 
promote the local economy and alleviate poverty in 
more than 1,000 tourist destinations in China. Since 
2018, we have expanded our charity efforts overseas 
and travelled extensively throughout the Middle East and West Africa to understand the medical and health
conditions faced by local children and the strong
need for support and basic facilities in these areas.
In 2019, we strengthened our community investment
commitments around the world by establishing
“STAR”, our long-term social responsibility strategy.
Under this strategy, we plan to invest 10 million RMB
in 50 charity projects through our newly launched
public welfare platform. This year, our charity efforts
are focused mainly on providing relief worldwide

In April 2020, we donated a total of 3 million surgical masks to over 25 countries
including Spain, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Hungary, Croatia,
and Chile, among others. We hope that the donations provided relief worldwide 
and encouraged countries to work together in combatting the pandemic.
Caring for Children in Cambodia
In June 2020, our staff in Cambodia donated surgical masks, alcohol hand sanitiser 
and medical gloves to underprivileged children in Cambodia. Our staff volunteers 
also donated blood to Angkor Hospital for Children. We believe that individual 
efforts will eventually make the entire community, and even the world, a better

Alleviating Poverty in China Through Local Tourism
Xigazê is a key poverty alleviation location in the Tibet Autonomous Region in 
China. Leveraging on Trip.com Group’s “Transport Public Welfare + Poverty 
Alleviation through Tourism” scheme, we conducted a 5,000 km expedition to 
overcome the difficulties when formulating a 13-day sustainable travel route. We 
set up our the first offline store travel outlet in Tibet Autonomous Region and will 
help cultivate local tourism companies. This initiative helps poverty alleviation by
