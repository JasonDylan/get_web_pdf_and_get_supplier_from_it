RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

A MESSAGE FROM BRIAN L  . ROBERTS
Last February, something extraordinary 
happened at Comcast NBCUniversal .  
We shared with the world how the vision 
of a remarkable young blind girl named 
Emily doesn’t depend on sight, but on 
what she allows herself to imagine .  
In “Emily’s Oz,” a commercial for the X1 
talking guide that aired during the 2015 
Oscars, viewers around the globe heard 
Emily describe the amazing world of 
beauty and wonder that she “sees”  
when she watches The Wizard of Oz . 
For me, her story was the ultimate 
fulfillment of our investments in making 
our technology and media accessible to 
the widest range of customers . It also 
gets to the heart of what we do and why 
we do it . At Comcast NBCUniversal, we 
actively build the world we want to see, 
and use the power of our technology, 
storytelling, and media platforms to 
reach people in meaningful ways and 
change their lives for the better  .
I’m incredibly proud of our achievements 
in 2015 . I recognize they could not 
have happened without the ongoing 
commitment of our 153,000 employees 
to create lasting change in people’s lives 
and in our shared communities .  
Last year, Comcast NBCUniversal 
contributed a combined $521 million in cash and in-kind support to local and 
national charitable organizations that 
share our commitment to improving 
communities and enriching lives . But 
that’s just part of our 2015 corporate 
citizenship story  .
We also channeled the power of our 
media platforms to focus attention on 
important issues and inspire people to 
take action . By hosting Red Nose Day,  
we helped raise $23 million for 
programs to benefit children and young people in poverty across the United 
States and around the world .
We connected more low-income families 
than in any previous year to the Internet at home . Through Internet Essentials, 
our high-speed Internet adoption 
program, we’ve now provided more  
than 600,000 low-income families to date — or more than 2 .4 million 
Americans — with access to resources 
to improve their quality of life .
We set a new record as more than 
100,000 of our employees, their friends, 
and their families volunteered alongside 
our nonprofit partners to complete over 
900 community projects during Comcast 
Cares Day, our annual celebration of 
our year-round commitment to service .  
Our employees also helped generate 
more than $10 million — the company’s highest-ever total — through our annual 
United Way giving campaign .
Meanwhile, we redoubled our efforts to 
bring the world’s most talented people 
into our ranks . This included hiring our 
first ever Vice President of Military and 
Veteran Affairs to help us reach our goal 
of hiring 10,000 veterans, National Guard 
and Reserve members, and military 
spouses by year-end 2017 .
And, as always, we looked for new ways 
to encourage innovation, including 
connecting with a new generation of 
startups and entrepreneurs in several 
communities . We believe a vibrant 
startup culture creates stronger cities .  
I would have loved to share these and 
other accomplishments with my father, 
Ralph Roberts, who founded Comcast 
in 1963 . He passed away last year, but 
I take heart in knowing that his legacy 
of integrity, community giving, and 
entrepreneurship is stronger than ever  . 
For that, I am grateful to our customers, 
our partners, and all our Comcast 
NBCUniversal employees . Thank you  
for an inspiring year  . 
 
“At Comcast 
NBCUniversal, we 
actively build the 
world we want to 
see, and use the 
power of our 
technology, 
storytelling, and media platforms  
to reach people in meaningful ways 
and change their 
lives for the better  .”

Our defining moment in  
social responsibility for 2015 
5  |  2016 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 
HOW THE XFINITY X1  
revolutionized television for people 
with visual disabilities
Despite his three years on the job, Tom Wlodkowski was 
nervous . Perched on his living room couch, tuned to NBC 
primetime on December 3, he knew the stakes were high .  
“I’m sitting there hoping this thing gets pulled off,” Tom says .  
“I felt like my neck was on the line . ”
The “thing” was the remake of the 1975 
Broadway musical The Wiz with real-
time video description — the first live 
entertainment program in U .S . history to be accessible to people with visual disabilities . FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler called it “genius . ”As Vice President of Accessibility  
at Comcast Cable, Tom — blind since  
birth — was more than just an interested viewer  . For Tom, his team, and the entire 
company, The Wiz Live! epitomized 
our goal to make our technology, entertainment, and services accessible 
to the widest possible audience .  The December broadcast capped a 
groundbreaking year for Comcast 
NBCUniversal . From a TV guide that 
talks, to a blind girl’s journey down  
her yellow brick road, to an African American version of Oz we can all now experience, 2015 was the culmination  
of years of work making our products more accessible .  
Our 2015 accessibility accomplishments galvanized people inside and outside the company  . They captured the attitudes 
that define our company culture: Think like an entrepreneur, embrace 
opportunity, and take risks in the service 
of innovation . And on a human level, they filled us with pride .  →

650,000
X1 boxes with talking  
guide activated nationwide
Developed with extensive 
input from Tom, visually impaired testers, and advocacy groups, the X1 talking guide is far greater than just a more accessible TV interface
 .
 Functionally, it 
reads aloud channel names X1 TALKING GUIDE WON SEVERAL AWARDS

in Accessibility (AAA)

Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD)

“The [X1 talking 
guide] reinforces 
what we teach here at Miami Lighthouse — that it’s possible to see without sight
 .”
—Virginia Jacko,  
President and CEO, Miami 
Lighthouse for the Blind“Comcast has not 
just provided a  
new feature, they’ve made a bold move to send a powerful message — a message of hope —  
a message that every person matters
 .”
—Matthew Vollbrecht,  
Comcast customer,  
Everett, PennsylvaniaIt all started with the X1 
talking guide, which traces its roots to a 2012 brainstorm session where a small team of Comcast developers asked a classic “what if” question: What if we gave customers a new way to discover what’s on TV? This simple text-to-speech idea picked up steam when Tom joined Comcast later that year
 . 
T
om knew firsthand why 
this was necessary  .
 “Visually 
impaired viewers were often stuck in an ancient channel up/channel down paradigm, wading through content with little context,” he says
 .
and numbers, time slots, and program details
 .
 But 
emotionally, it represents a leap forward in independence
 . 
Visuall
y impaired viewers can 
now easily watch and record their favorite shows without assistance from a spouse, parent, child, or other viewer  
in the room
 . 
The t
alking guide 
revolutionized accessible TV entertainment
 .
 “The impact 
was tremendous,” Tom says
 . 
“It w
as a true game changer 
for accessibility  .” And it
 
helped position Comcast NBCUniversal as a leader in technology for visually impaired customers
 .

VOICES OF INNOVATION
OUR VISION MADE REAL
7  |  2016 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 
Developing the X1 talking guide 
was an achievement in itself  .  
It also inspired us to push  
even further, spurring our  
next “what if” question:  
What if we could bring  
together talent and creativity from across the company  
and show what it’s like to experience entertainment when you’re blind?
The result was “Emily’s Oz,” 
an acclaimed 60-second commercial that aired during 
the 2015 Academy Awards . A 
promotion for the X1 talking guide, the ad told the story of Emily, a 7-year-old girl who was born blind, yet sees the 
world more vividly than most .  In making the commercial, 
we asked Emily to describe 
what she envisions when she 
watches her favorite movie, The Wizard of Oz . We then enlisted some of the entertainment 
industry’s finest puppet and set 
designers and makeup artists to bring her vision to life . The TV spot, national campaign, and accompanying interactive 
website drew praise from 
across the country and helped spark a conversation about how people with disabilities access entertainment .  
We continued the conversation with the May launch of the 
XFINITY remote with voice 
control, which enabled customers to use their voice to navigate thousands of 
shows and movies on X1 .  
Viewers can search for content, 
set DVR recordings, get recommendations, and navigate XFINITY On Demand .  
And we weren’t done yet . →

this was something absolutely unbelievable, and that I should be proud of the part  
I took in building it . ”

member, upon watching

commercial

RAINBOW OF OPPORTUNITY
OUR VISION MADE REAL
8  |  2016 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT  
The pursuit of innovation 
requires risk . A little  
good timing and luck  
also don’t hurt .  
Maggie Suniewick, Senior 
Vice President of Strategic 
Innovation, was once Tom’s office neighbor  . Reunited at 
a meeting last year, the two 
friends discussed how they 
could work together  . The 
success of the X1 talking guide and the “Emily’s Oz” accessibility spot led Maggie 
and Tom to talk about cross-
company collaboration, thinking big, and taking risks . Maggie is responsible for identifying and promoting companywide marketing initiatives to support upcoming NBCUniversal programming, 
movies, and events and 
Comcast’s products and services .
“Tom and I thought ‘How cool 
would it be if we took The Wiz Live!, which was our planned 
live entertainment special 
for December, and made it accessible to people with visual disabilities?’” she says .
At an exploratory meeting in 
September, Tom outlined the idea for a video description 
broadcast: Live narration 
would use natural pauses in the dialogue to describe visual elements of the show  . A follow-up meeting 
in October with leaders 
from across Comcast 
NBCUniversal cemented the idea . The countdown began .  
It was a big risk for Tom and the company  . Nobody had 
ever tried something so bold 
in a live broadcast before .  
If it worked, it would be the 
latest triumph in a year full of firsts for accessible entertainment . But we didn’t 
know for sure how it would 
play out . →
“What you and I 
might say in three 
sentences, they might have to put into three words because you don’t want to step on the dialogue . ”
—Diane Johnson, CEO and 
President of Descriptive 
Video Works, on the 
challenge of narrating a 
live performance
LEFT: Performers rehearse for The Wiz Live!, the first live show in U.S. broadcast history to include real-time video description. RIGHT: Closed captioning is among the X1’s 
accessibility features that give customers with disabilities more satisfying ways to experience the shows and movies they love.
VISIONARY RISK
OUR VISION MADE REAL
9  |  2016 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT  
Tom says pulling off something 
like The Wiz Live! — and 
taking the necessary risks to 
try — starts at the top . “There 
are so many extraordinarily talented people across the company willing to lean in to get something done,” he 
says . “That doesn’t happen by 
accident . The entrepreneurial spirit and permission to take risks come from our leaders, 
from Brian Roberts on down . ”Which brings us back to 
that night in Tom’s living room . You could excuse him 
for being nervous . As an 
employee, he was about to witness a defining moment for accessibility at Comcast NBCUniversal . And as a 
consumer and viewer who 
is blind, he was about to experience a true first in storytelling for the visually 
impaired .  
“At 8 p .m ., when I heard the first words out of the 
describer’s mouth, I jumped in the air,” he says . “Because at that point I knew the vision was real at last . We had just 
made change happen, all of 
us .” Again . 
 
During The Wiz 
Live!, a narrator 
was live in-studio, describing the action to viewers as it was being performed . The video description gave visually impaired viewers a rich new way to experience live TV  .

OUR VISION MADE REAL

Q: WHAT IS THE INSPIRATION BEHIND 
COMCAST NBCUNIVERSAL'S CORPORATE 
CITIZENSHIP PROGRAMS?
David: We always want to be a respected 
corporate leader that makes our 
communities better while providing 
world-class media and technology to 
educate, empower, connect, and inspire our audiences and customers .  
For more than half a century, our 
company has played a defining role 
in shaping the future of media and 
technology, and we maintain an 
unwavering commitment to pursue 
transformative ways to enrich people’s 
lives and create stronger communities 
for generations to come . Our 
achievements in making our technology 
more accessible to blind and visually 
impaired customers is a perfect example 
of the impact we aspire to make . We're 
proud that our accessibility innovations 
have been recognized by Associated 
Services for the Blind, the American 
Foundation for the Blind, the American 
Association of People with Disabilities, 
and the FCC, among others .
We also deeply believe in making 
technology more accessible to people 
regardless of income, so that everyone 
has equal access to the opportunities that 
can empower them to improve their lives .  
Closing the digital divide is imperative in 
the 21st century, and while our Internet 
Essentials program has connected more 
than 2 .4 million low-income Americans to the Internet at home, we recognize much 
more needs to be done and are committed 
to doing so .
Q: AS TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES, HOW 
DOES THAT CHANGE THE WAY 
COMCAST NBCUNIVERSAL HELPS 
COMMUNITIES CONNECT?
David: While innovation is good for our 
business and our customers, we also believe it’s good for our communities .  
In the past year, we’ve put tremendous 
effort into supporting entrepreneurship 
in cities like Denver, Nashville, New 
Haven, and Philadelphia as we put a 
new emphasis on how communities 
experience our company  . 
One of our goals is to help build 
entrepreneurial ecosystems outside of 
traditional tech cities like San Francisco 
and Seattle so that other communities 
and cities can reap the social and 
economic benefits of a vibrant  
startup culture .   
Q: HOW DO YOU SEE COMCAST 
NBCUNIVERSAL ’S CORPORATE 
CITIZENSHIP ROLE EVOLVING ON A 
WIDER SCALE?
David: We’re always looking for ways to 
use technology to benefit our customers 
and audiences and the communities we 
share . We have an amazing storytelling 
platform, including film, television, news 
media, digital, and theme parks . And 
from the top down, we’re committed 
to using the full power of that platform 
to improve lives around the world . We 
can use it to entertain, but we can also 
use it to inform and educate . We can 
tell compelling stories that touch on 
important social issues and inspire our 
viewers to take action .  
Last May, we teamed up with Comic 
Relief, Walgreens, and several other 
partners to bring Red Nose Day from 
the U .K . to the United States . The star-
studded three-hour event was fun and 
funny and moving, and it raised more 
than $23 million to help lift young people 
out of poverty worldwide, including here 
in the U .S .  
This year, we are amplifying our efforts 
with Red Nose Day and also Global 
Citizen, which encourages ordinary citizens to get involved in the fight 
against global poverty and other critical 
issues . Joining together epitomizes 
our company’s commitment to use 
the strength of the entire Comcast 
NBCUniversal platform to take on big 
and important issues .  
Q: YOU’VE SAID THAT COMCAST 
NBCUNIVERSAL IS COMMITTED TO 
BEING THE MODEL COMPANY FOR 
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. WHAT 
2015 DIVERSITY INITIATIVES BEST 
REPRESENT THAT MISSION? 
David: We were the first media and 
technology company to become a 
member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable, 
which recognizes companies that spend 
more than $1 billion annually with 
minority- and women-owned suppliers .  
We’re passionate about advancing 
supply chain opportunities for diverse 
businesses and believe it’s important 
to share best practices and thought 
leadership with others in our industry  . 
We also announced our goal of hiring 
10,000 veterans, National Guard and 
Reserve members, and military spouses 
by year-end 2017 . People in the military 
community bring valuable leadership, 
technology, and problem-solving skills to the table, and their diverse experiences 
enrich our business .

SUPPORTING  
OUR MILITARY  
COMMUNITY
Comcast NBCUniversal hired Carol Eggert, a retired brigadier general, as Vice President of Military and Veteran Affairs in 2015.
Our company is committed to being 
the employer of choice and the chosen provider of services for members of the 
military community  . But earning their 
confidence takes more than goals or 
initiatives . It takes a proven track record .  
It also takes a deep understanding of the skills the military population brings 
to the workplace and what makes its 
individual members tick .
For decades, we’ve been a leader in 
meeting the needs of our military communities — from dedicated hiring initiatives to targeted solutions for 
members transitioning to civilian life .  
In 2015, we multiplied our efforts by 
creating a new team, the Department of Military and Veteran Affairs, committed to meeting the unique needs of our 
military customers and to recruiting, 
hiring, and incorporating military talent across all levels of our organization .  
That’s where Carol comes in, stepping To Carol Eggert, hiring military 
talent is just strong business .  
“We need the skills these men and women provide,” says Carol, a retired brigadier general and Vice President of Military and Veteran Affairs at Comcast NBCUniversal .  
into a role that allows her to continue 
working with the military community  . 
Carol has served our nation for

General for the Pennsylvania National Guard . She served a 15-month combat tour in Iraq and has received numerous awards, including the Bronze Star and 
Purple Heart . She will tell you that after 
retirement she wasn’t looking for a position, but a purpose, which she found when she joined Comcast NBCUniversal 
in 2015 . Now she’s applying her deep 
knowledge of the military community to lead our veterans and military programs .  
Fortunately, she’s starting with a strong foundation . Through our unique and targeted programs, we have been able to attract and support talented 
employees with diverse experiences 
and backgrounds . That includes hiring more than 3,600 veterans between 2012 and 2014 . In 2015 alone, we made approximately 2,400 military hires —  
a 38% increase over the previous year  .
Beyond hiring, Comcast NBCUniversal spearheaded projects like “Next Steps for Vets,” an online portal that provides employment information, small-business development tools, and 
educational resources tailored to military 
veterans . In addition, our Veterans Network Employee Resource Group is dedicated to helping military members grow professionally and personally  . 
“The fact that a company takes the time to understand the military culture 
is exactly what veterans and military 
members want to see,” Carol says .  
“Comcast NBCUniversal is empathizing with what service members have done 
and what they continue to do . And 
crucially, we’re recognizing the inherent skills they can bring to our company  .”
Tapping into those skills is Carol’s top priority  . From leadership to 
adaptability, collaboration to stakeholder management, the military instills 
capabilities that easily transfer to 
the corporate world . With the U .S .

TECHWOMEN  
SPARKS POWERFUL 
CONNECTIONS 
Sherita Ceasar , Senior Vice President of National Video Deployment Engineering at Comcast, and Sowmya Gottipati, Vice President of Media Labs at NBCUniversal, brainstorm 
with other TECHWomen members on how to make Comcast NBCUniversal an “employer of choice” for women in technology.
When Beth Arnholt, in close partnership 
with the company’s senior technology leaders, set out to close the distance 
between these talented professionals 
by organizing our company’s first TECHWomen Conference, even she  
was astounded by the response .   
“Our senior leaders, male and female, 
rallied to show their commitment,”  
says Beth, Vice President of Integrated 
Talent Management . “And the women  
in attendance literally didn’t want to 
leave . They were just so excited to talk 
about their projects and build off each other’s energy  .”
Since that inaugural event two years ago, TECHWomen has grown into an ongoing forum for female technologists to connect across business groups, 
contribute to the broader strategy of our 
company, and inspire more innovative work . We now have eight TECHWomen chapters around the world: Denver; Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey; Los So many women work 
in technology-related roles across Comcast NBCUniversal . Yet as recently as 2014, there were no forums to bring these like-minded women together  .
Angeles; New York City; Orlando, Florida; 
Philadelphia; Seattle; and London .  
Each chapter hosts its own events and 
activities, and three more chapters are 
soon to launch .
And each chapter feeds the others .  
From networking events to leadership “This has been a great 
opportunity for people 
to flex their leadership 
skills and take on  
roles that they may  
not normally have in 
their day-to-day work . ”

panels, TECHWomen groups design 
their activities to forge new connections, provide opportunities to learn and 
contribute to the business, and 
“innovate at the boundaries,” as a recent TECHWomen Conference speaker said . They borrow from the startup culture — employees discover common 
ground and generate actionable ideas in 
collaborative environments . The group’s 2015 conference included an opportunity to discuss the national group’s focus 
in the coming year, as well as hands-
on breakout sessions on emerging technologies in media and high tech, Comcast user experience research,  
and insight on building connected  
health systems .  
Collaboration between the attendees 
also resulted in new ideas and business 
opportunities throughout 2015 .  
“One of our members from the X1 product development team started talking with somebody from our Comcast Spectacor sports arena business at 
the conference about new ways to use 
X1 as a ticket sales channel,” Beth says . “We’re creating connections that encourage people to think differently, not only about their impact on the 
success of our company, but also about 
how they can influence the future of women in technology  .”
While Beth’s team is involved with the local chapters, the members set their own priorities in the spirit of the “by TECHWomen, for TECHWomen” 
philosophy  . Local chapters are where 
the TECHWomen mission is further 
integrated into the business and tailored to local needs .
“This has been a great opportunity for 
people to flex their leadership skills and 
take on roles that they may not normally 
have in their day-to-day work,” says Jane Cha-Lee, who works on Beth's team .  
“We rely on their initiative to keep the momentum going, and it’s exciting to 
hear so many women say how rewarding 
this has been . ”Building students’ interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers — a companywide focus — is also high on the agenda for TECHWomen . “Regardless of whether or 
not you are a technologist or a woman, 
getting more STEM professionals into the pipeline is vital for the future of our whole company,” Beth says .
“Our members are going out to schools 
and talking about what it’s like to be a 
software engineer,” she adds . “They’re 
mentoring girls through Big Brothers Big Sisters . They’re helping coach FIRST
® Robotics teams . ”
TECHWomen representatives have also served on panels and as keynote speakers at industry forums, such as the 2015

In July, we helped launch a five-month Native Workforce Development pilot program in Seattle and Denver to help urban Native Americans reach their peak potential . The program, a partnership between Comcast, Chief Seattle Club, Denver Indian Center, and the National Urban Indian Family Coalition, gave adult participants instruction in the necessary skills to succeed in corporate environments, including how to prepare for a job, navigate the 
workplace, and build a professional network . Designed to address the persistent underrepresentation of urban

Access to the web opens a world of 
employment, learning, and social opportunities . But for those who can’t 
afford home Internet service or don’t 
know how to use this resource, life on the wrong side of the digital divide can be isolating and discouraging .
Just 18% of U .S . households with incomes 
at or below $14,000 — the average annual 
income of a public housing resident   — 
have a fixed Internet connection at home, 
according to U .S . Census Bureau data . By contrast, 90% of households with incomes above $100,000 have home connections .  
And millions of low-income Americans lack the basic digital literacy skills required to compete for higher-paying jobs .

with local school districts and nonprofits to provide digital literacy training .  
Qualifying households in Comcast’s 
subscription area — which spans 39 
states and the District of Columbia —  
can receive high-speed broadband service for $9 .95 per month .
And we’ve continued expanding 
broadband access every year  . 
Internet Essentials added 180,000 
new households in 2015, doubled the 
service’s download speed, and launched new pilot programs for low-income senior citizens and community college students .
“Bringing the Internet within everyone’s 
reach is a natural outgrowth of our 
business, but it means so much more to Comcast,” Karima says . “We believe this is a vital resource that people need to 
thrive in everyday life . ”
Those people include families like the 
Martinezes, who emigrated from Mexico to Hammond, Indiana, in 2013 . Leuziel Martinez worked a series of low-paying jobs while his wife cared for their four 
children; they had no room in their 
budget for Internet service .
Their oldest son, Jonathan, used to 
spend hours in a booth at McDonald’s doing his homework or in the public library rushing through web research in hopes of finishing before it closed .
“When my teachers assigned a research 
project my sophomore year, I couldn’t think about the work right away  . I had to 
figure out how to get online that night,” 
Jonathan, now 20, recalls . Finding a free WiFi signal was sometimes harder than 
doing his actual assignments .
“Mom had to bring my two little brothers 
and sister with us,” he says . “Some nights we had to get home before I finished my work, but at that point there was nothing I could do . ”
Then a family friend told his parents about Internet Essentials, and web 
access suddenly went from frustrating  
to empowering .
“The Internet is a huge part of our lives 
now,” says Jonathan, who graduated second in his class from City Baptist High School in 2015 . “My brothers and I 
use it all the time to get our work done 
Affordable home Internet access is helping Jonathan pursue his interest in software development. 
faster  . My mom pays our bills online . It 
even helped my dad find a better job . ”
After graduation, Jonathan enrolled in Year Up, a nonprofit vocational training 
program that also helped him land an internship at Allstate Insurance . Working with the company’s roadside assistance mobile apps has stoked Jonathan’s 
interest in software development as a 
potential career  .
And his parents, who used to be skeptical about the web, now regularly video chat with relatives in Mexico and search for information online .
“The Internet gives us huge opportunities,”  
Jonathan says . “Now that we have it, our 
chances of everything are just greater  .”
Since its inception, Internet Essentials has connected more than 600,000 low-income households — about 2 .4 million people in all — to educational, social, and economic opportunities online . Families automatically qualify if they have at least 
one K-12 student who is eligible for the 
National School Lunch Program .

We’ve since lowered this eligibility 
threshold to 40%, matching the  
standard for schools to receive  
federal Title I funding .
Comcast also doubled Internet 
Essentials’ broadband download speed 
to up to 10 megabits per second last year and began offering a WiFi router to each eligible household at no additional cost .  
Now, children and their parents can do homework, send email, visit websites, or use social media on multiple devices at the same time .
These enhancements, along with our 
senior and community college pilots (see sidebar), helped Internet Essentials grow 
by more than 100,000 households from 
July through December 2015 — more than in any previous six-month span .  
“We’re constantly asking how we can improve,” Karima says .
That includes working with hundreds of 
community organizations to attack the 
digital divide from another angle .
“The success of Internet Essentials, 
which has connected substantially more families to the Internet than all other private sector programs combined, is rooted in its unique wraparound design," 
says David L . Cohen, Senior Executive 
Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer of Comcast .  “It addresses all three of  
the major barriers to broadband 
adoption — price of the service, price of computer equipment, and most 
importantly of all, a bucket of digital 
relevance and literacy issues . ” 
“Digital literacy skills are crucial for 
anyone who wants to unlock the full 
value of this incredible tool — to learn, find a job, socialize, and just be more connected with your community,” Karima says . Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Big Brothers Big Sisters, the YMCA, and the Police Athletic League are just a few of our partners in this effort .
Karima looks forward to the day when 
families and communities no longer 
need Internet Essentials at all .
“I want us to be so effective at 
connecting underserved people and 
improving their lives that this program becomes irrelevant,” she explains .  
“Because we would have much lower unemployment, higher school 
attendance and graduation rates, 
and more households plugged into healthcare and social services .   
A greater sense of community and support — that’s what Internet access makes possible . ” PILOT BRINGS 
AFFORDABLE WEB ACCESS TO SENIOR CITIZENS, STUDENTS 
Only 25% of Americans over age  
65 with incomes under $30,000 have high-
speed Internet at home, compared with  
82% with incomes above $75,000.  
A new Internet Essentials pilot program aims to balance the scales by making online access more affordable — and user-friendly —  
for underserved senior citizens.
Comcast is offering senior citizens in Palm 
Beach County, Florida, and San Francisco high-speed broadband service for $9.95 per month. We’re also working with local government and nonprofit partners in these communities to provide digital literacy courses tailored to older users.
“As people grow older, they are more likely  
to grow socially isolated,” says Karima 
Zedan, Senior Director of Internet Essentials. “Having the web at home lets senior citizens easily communicate with family and friends, access healthcare information and services, and stay involved in their communities.”
We launched a second pilot in 2015 for 
low-income community college students in Colorado and Illinois who qualify for financial aid through Federal Pell Grants.

Nearly 340 volunteers teamed up to beautify Houston Elementary School in Washington, D.C., as part of Comcast Cares Day.
The rows of flowers and the 
murals lining Charles H .  
Houston Elementary School in Washington, D .C ., are pleasing to visitors . But to the children enrolled here, these splashes of color and creativity mean far more .
This annual celebration of year-round

nonprofit partner representatives for 
service projects at over 900 sites in 2015 . Fueled by our employees’ shared passion for supporting their local 
communities, Comcast Cares Day 
generates both immediate results and lasting benefits .

“Employees drive Comcast Cares Day 
from beginning to end — they are our 
best ambassadors . They appreciate the organizations that have made a difference in their lives, and they want to personally give back . ”
One in every eight Comcast Cares Day 
projects last year focused on renovating 
local schools to provide a better learning environment for children .  
Volunteers also helped improve parks, beaches, senior centers, and other 
community sites across the United 
States and 21 other countries .
“Comcast NBCUniversal is so immersed 
in communities, and the people who work there genuinely want to help their neighbors,” says City Year Detroit Executive Director Andrew Stein, who 
helped coordinate the service day at 
Houston . “It has a transformational impact on the students as they walk through the door of this school each 
day .” City Year, an education-focused 
national service organization and one 
of our national partners, has supported Comcast Cares Day since 2001 . Comcast sponsors teams of City Year AmeriCorps 
members, who serve as tutors, mentors, and role models to students in high-need 
schools across the country, keeping kids in school and on track to graduation .  
One of the benefits of Comcast Cares Day is that we can make major 
improvements quickly  . “When you drop 
340 people into one school for Comcast 
Cares Day, you can accomplish a ton,” Andrew says . “It’s more than just 
cleanup work — these are all things  
that make kids want to come to school 
and learn . ” 
Volunteers are particularly valuable to schools like Houston, which serves about 240 students in a mostly low-income neighborhood . Rembert and 
his staff put most of their energy into 
raising academic performance, he says . “There’s no way I could have accomplished this many projects without somebody like Comcast there  
to make it happen . ”
Comcast also provided a $25,000 grant that allowed the school to buy 50 new 
laptops . “Having greater access to 
technology helps our students see the world differently,” Rembert says .  
“They’re able to learn more naturally 
and in ways that excite them . ”
This spring, Houston teachers will use the eight garden boxes built on 
Comcast Cares Day to teach students about urban farming and other subjects .  
“Long term, the support from Comcast NBCUniversal is a tremendous benefit 
for every student here,” Rembert says .  
“It’s made my job a lot easier,  
and let’s just say our kids are very 
motivated now  .”

On-screen diversity is good business . It’s 
proven to be a big draw at the box office

On-screen diversity also makes stories relatable to wider audiences . It’s no small thing for people from all cultures and communities to see themselves

One of the most powerful outlets for 
diverse storytelling is reality television, precisely because it’s unscripted and depicts the lives of real people .

Created by writer/director Richard

However, creating a U .S . version meant 
facing an issue of scale . With 320 million 
people and multiple time zones, it would take a powerful broadcast partner and unwavering commitment to make the 
fundraising event succeed .

Our partnerships were key  . We worked 
closely with Comic Relief, Inc ., to 
organize the broadcast . By spotlighting 
A-list celebrities and leveraging 
our partnerships with retailers and nonprofits such as Walgreens, Mars, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we 
brought “red noses” into the American 
consciousness and inspired everyone to join in on the action .  
The $23 million raised went to 12 charities that focus on children’s education, healthcare, and safety, including Oxfam and Save the Children, 
Boys & Girls Clubs of America, United

CAMPAIGN LEADS FIGHT AGAINST FOOD WASTE 
Roughly 40% of all food in the U .S . ends up in landfills, and the average American family spends more than

to waste less, shop wiser, and make food last longer — through our multiplatform #NoFoodWasted campaign .

OUR  
INNOVATION
Innovation drives us to imagine the future, shape the world in 
new ways, and see opportunities where others haven’t . It sparks 
new possibilities for our customers, our communities, and our 
business . At Comcast NBCUniversal, innovation brings out the  
very best in us — inside and outside our walls .
As a company fueled by an entrepreneurial 
spirit, we know the spark of innovation can 
start anywhere, anytime . So we encourage 
our employees to pursue what’s next, 
from advancements that delight our 
customers to projects that move entire communities forward . And we partner with entrepreneurs who are the next generation of influencers in our society  .
2015 was an inspiring year for innovation 
at Comcast NBCUniversal . We connected 
with a new generation of startups in 
several cities to help them harness 
the social and economic value of a 
vibrant entrepreneurial culture . Leading 
startups and entrepreneurs took part 
in our Innovations 4 Entrepreneurs 
competition, exploring new ways to 
integrate technology into their businesses .  And energy-saving initiatives across 
our businesses demonstrated the vital 
relationship between sustainability  
and innovation .
NBCUniversal launched its first Open 
Possibilities partnerships with social 
entrepreneurs, startups, and other organizations . Partnerships included the 
Millennial Trains Project, an organization 
that takes young entrepreneurs on cross-
country journeys to meet local city leaders 
and other prominent mentors while 
building and developing project ideas to 
address social issues in communities .  
Together, these actions reflect our  
belief that a culture of innovation and  
for innovation is a powerful force for 
growth and change .

Denver is home to the Commons on Champa, which Comcast helped establish last May. The 20,000-square-foot innovation hub and event space is geared toward budding 
entrepreneurs.
Every entrepreneurial 
journey starts somewhere .  
In the case of many aspiring Denver entrepreneurs, that somewhere is now the Commons on Champa, a cutting-edge innovation hub and public event space in downtown Denver  . 
easier to create the next big idea if you 
have the full support of the innovation community, and thinking forward 
together helps us prepare for the future .
“We want to create a signature space for 
technology, expertise, and innovation,” 
says Michael Soileau, Vice President of Competitive Planning and Strategy for Comcast . “We also want to create 
ongoing engagement with community “We want to create

We believe it’s good for our business, 
good for local communities, and good  
for our cities . ” 
Comcast NBCUniversal encourages 
innovation throughout our business,  
and 2015 was the year we put a stake  
in the ground for entrepreneurship  
in our communities . From young technologists and promising startup 
businesses, to public facilities in  
some of our most forward-thinking cities, we invested in and fostered innovation in all forms and places .  
Michael and his team are building on the initial Denver project by partnering with 
four additional cities — Philadelphia; 
Chicago; Nashville, Tennessee; and New Haven, Connecticut — on similar infras tructure initiatives . The projects focus on strategic technology and 
community investments that drive 
economic development in these cities .
Other national efforts include 
partnerships like the Colorado Innovation Network, which leads and collaborates on programs, events, and 
initiatives that will drive Colorado’s 
innovation community  . We are also  a marquee sponsor of Chicago Ideas 
Week, a week-long communion of 
thinkers and instigators sharing ideas .  
In 2015, Chief Business Development 
Officer Sam Schwartz deepened our relationships with the local and national 
startup community by recruiting Danielle 
Cohn as our first Senior Director of Entrepreneurial Engagement . Danielle is our company’s startup advocate, and her team is developing ongoing engagement and programming opportunities in startup communities nationwide .
Last year, Danielle led efforts to engage 
with more than 1,000 technology 
entrepreneurs and startups for Comcast 
NBCUniversal . That’s 1,000 potential partners, contributors, vendors, or employees — all with innovations they believe will shape the future .
“As a technology company, we’re always 
on the lookout for new, unique, and exciting partners, ideas, and products,” says Sam . “We are truly passionate 
about supporting the next generation 
of founders through mentoring, partnerships, and other valuable relationships and resources . ”

In September, Comcast partnered 
with PennApps — the world’s largest collegiate hackathon run by students — 
to give valuable experience and exposure 
to future technologists . For three days, 2,000 of the world’s top young coders huddled in the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia (owned by Comcast 
Spectacor) to showcase their skills .  
Student teams had 36 hours to build the 
most innovative software and hardware products they could imagine, in chosen 
categories and with preexisting parts 
and demanding constraints .  
Participants hailed from countries as far away as Spain, Australia, and Cameroon, but they all had one thing in common:  
a desire to show the world what hacking really means . For a long weekend, we had 
a chance to engage with a community 
of aspiring dreamers, builders, and innovators who might someday push the envelope for our customers as Comcast NBCUniversal developers .

Go ahead, try to predict  
the next big idea . What  
will tomorrow’s technology 
revolution look like? Where will it begin? No one knows for sure . But we do know the next generation of thinkers and influencers is a great place to start .  “We’re able to expose 
these students to

In August, Comcast was a presenting 
sponsor at the first-ever Open for Innovation Day, hosted by the 
U .S . Department of Commerce in 
Washington, D .C . In a role reversal, established companies pitched funded innovation projects to qualified 
startups seeking partners .  
Events like our hackathons provide an ideal opportunity to attract and 
engage the future of innovation . That’s especially important for the day these bright young minds seek venture capital, a new job, or a pitch session 
with a resourceful partner  . And in the 
case of Philadelphia-based PennApps, 
it allows us to show off a bit, too .
“We’re able to expose these students

Following the success of our inaugural 
Comcast NBCUniversal Hackathons in 2014, the series continued with events in March (Orlando, Florida) and June (London) . The Orlando hackathon —  
which focused on developing cool ideas and technologies in immersive entertainment — featured 42 teams competing for cash, prizes, and the chance to pitch their ideas to 
NBCUniversal Media Labs .
London hackathon teams used
