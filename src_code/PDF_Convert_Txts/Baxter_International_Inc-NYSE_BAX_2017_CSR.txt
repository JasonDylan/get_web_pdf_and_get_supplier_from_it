2               BAXTER 2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Baxter's corporate responsibility priorities span the range of 
our operations and ambitions, from reducing our environmental footprint to addressing the healthcare needs of underserved communities. These goals do not run in parallel to our mission for patients and our business strategies; they are inextricably linked, demonstrating our belief that true success comes only by addressing the expectations and interests of our diverse stakeholder base in a unified, integrated way.
Among the 2017 highlights you’ll find summarized in the following pages:
• 30% of our energy use from operations in 2017 was from renewable resources, and we reduced absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 17% versus 2015. 
• Driving Your Health, a mobile health program supported by Baxter International Foundation and the global humanitarian 
organization Direct Relief, completed its first full year, increasing access to care for more than 23,000 people in disadvantaged communities in and around Mexico City. 
• We achieved outstanding employee safety performance, reducing our recordable case rate by 27% year over year. 
To ensure our momentum, we continue listening to and learning from our stakeholders. In early 2018, our Corporate Responsibility Council engaged an outside partner to interview key internal and external stakeholders to ensure we remain focused on issues that matter most, are material
* to us from a 
corporate responsibility perspective and allow us to make the greatest impact. We will continue refining our programs and approach moving forward.TABLE OF CONTENTS

Within days of Hurricane Maria making landfall in Puerto Rico, Joe Almeida 
visited Baxter facilities across the island (including Guayama, above) to meet with employees and assess the disaster’s impact.From the Chairman and CEO
One of our cornerstone commitments is responding to 
communities in urgent need; and in 2017 we were tested by a string of natural disasters where we live and work. From earthquakes in Mexico to a mudslide in Colombia to hurricanes across the Caribbean and continental United 
States and beyond, our team stepped up repeatedly through product and financial donations, extraordinary on-the-ground support, volunteerism, and more. Our continued focus on conservation and reducing our environmental footprint is another way we’re helping to directly address the potential threat and impact of natural disasters globally.
Yet one catastrophe struck especially close to home: On September 20, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, devastating the lives of millions, including more than 2,000 Baxter employees, while severely damaging the local infrastructure and power grid that supports three Baxter manufacturing facilities. 
Our global team mobilized rapidly to help our colleagues, their families and the community. We procured necessities like food, water, gas and toiletries, as well as generators and propane cooktops. We coordinated multiple daily flights to transport supplies, installed laundry stations at our facilities and more.
Meanwhile, our employees in Puerto Rico moved selflessly to continue addressing the needs of patients and healthcare providers, who rely on our life-sustaining products. Limited local production resumed within days of the storm. Employees from other sites across our global network rose to the occasion, helping address supply gaps as Puerto Rico operations returned to full capacity.
So many have earned our gratitude for their roles in our 
response, including our employees worldwide, who are 
tenaciously focused on serving patients; our customers, who 
endured temporary supply challenges; and our partners at U.S. Food and Drug Administration, who moved quickly to approve temporary special importation of products from alternative sites. 
I want to thank our 47,000 Baxter colleagues globally for 
their commitment and passion, which fuels our progress as a corporate citizen and furthers our mission to save and sustain lives. And thanks to our many stakeholders, whose priorities and collaboration help shape our aspirations. Together, we  
will continue making a meaningful difference that will be felt t
oday, tomorrow and for generations to come.

MATERIALITY
As part of Baxter's philosophy of continuous 
improvement and in an effort to remain mindful of the 
current landscape within which we operate, the company periodically conducts assessments to identify the corporate responsibility issues that are most relevant to Baxter and its stakeholders. In early 2018, Baxter worked with an external partner to update its prior corporate responsibility “materiality” assessment, conducted in 2015.  As used in this report, “materiality” or “material” refers to environmental, social and economic issues that are deemed to be of significant importance to Baxter's stakeholders and to the company. These “material” issues inform Baxter's corporate responsibility strategy, priorities and goals, and reporting, and are not the same as “material” issues for the purposes of the company's financial and SEC reporting in the United States. 
The process for this assessment included: 
• Review of the material corporate responsibility 
issues defined in 2015
•
 As
sessment of the material issues of industry peers, 
based on recent corporate responsibility reports
• Anal ysis of issues defined as material by the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
for the Medical Equipment and Supplies and Pharmaceuticals industries
•
 R
eview of issues prioritized for the Health Care 
Equipment and Supplies industry by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index
• De velopment of a working list of material issues 
based on the analysis described above
• Int erviews conducted with 15 Baxter executives and 14 
external stakeholders, including customers, investors, NGOs, suppliers and other companies, to determine how important it is for Baxter to effectively 
manage 
each issue on the working list, considering factors such 
as the impact of the issue on Baxter as well as the 
company's impacts and influence related to each issue* In this report, Baxter is not using the terms “material” and “materiality” as defined for the purposes of financial and SEC reporting in the United States. 
Instead, the terms refer to environmental, social and economic issues that are of significant importance to Baxter's stakeholders and to the company. These “material” issues inform Baxter's corporate responsibility strategy, priorities and goals, and reporting. The issues in this table are listed in alphabetical order. The listing does not reflect the presumed importance or “materiality” of any particular issue to Baxter or its stakeholders. BAXTER’S MATERIAL ISSUES *

Baxter products save and sustain lives worldwide. This 
delivers on the company’s mission and represents its most important contribution to society. Quality and patient safety underpin the company’s ongoing success. Baxter has extensive policies and processes to ensure excellence in these areas, and continues to innovate 
new products and services that enhance patient safety.
The demand for Baxter’s products will continue to 
grow as the global population pushes toward 9.7 billion people by 2050
1 and standards of living improve globally. 
To minimize the company’s environmental impacts, Baxter works to capture the most value possible from the natural resources needed to manufacture, transport, use and recover the company’s products. Baxter is continuing to shift from a linear model of “take, make, dispose” to the circular model illustrated in the graphic below. This approach can save money, improve Baxter’s reputation and reduce the company’s environmental impact and that of its customers.

QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY
Baxter’s reputation and ongoing success depend on 
the quality and safety of its products and services.  
A focus on quality is embedded across the product life cy
cle, from product development and enhancements

Baxter’s Top 20 Complaint Reduction program is intended to enhance product performance and safety. In 2017, this program helped the company decrease product complaint incidents by 24% compared to 2015, exceeding its goal of a 15% reduction. Baxter’s continued improvement in this area is due to work across the company, including investigations of the company’s quality systems by engineering and scientific staff, close work with global regulatory bodies and collaboration with Baxter’s global business unit leads. These efforts have improved the company’s manufacturing and service operations and improved alignment globally across call intake and complaint processing centers.Complaints related to the following two products 
decreased during 2017 due to Baxter’s efforts to improve 
product quality and safety. 
• The c ompany improved troubleshooting at its 
call centers to more effectively resolve customer issues for the HomeChoice PD system. Baxter also improved the product’s reliability through component enhancements and updates to the HomeChoice cassette packaging to reduce  
defects that can occur during distribution and whil
e opening the product. As a result, complaints 
associated with these products decreased by 20%.  
Baxter intends to implement these packaging 
improvements to its HomeChoice Claria   
PD platform. 
• To improve its Access disposable IV products, 
Baxter implemented several changes at the facility that manufactures them, including modifications to molds, updates to the manufacturing process to resolve connection issues and an increase in preventive maintenance for assembly equipment.  
As a result, complaints related to this product fell 40% during the y
ear. 
The company collaborates with regulatory bodies  
to advance quality and safety.2 For instance, Baxter  
is working with U.S. Food and Drug Administration  
(FDA) to develop standards and metrics that 
the agency can use to more effectively compare companies, identify leaders in quality and safety, and determine the frequency of inspections. In 2017, two of Baxter’s manufacturing facilities were among the first to participate in FDA’s pilot of this program and will be exempt from routine inspections for the duration of the company’s engagement in the program. Baxter continues to Sharesource Remote Patient 
Automated Peritoneal Dialysis Management System
Baxter’s Sharesource remote patient management 
system increases patient access to home 
therapy and is offered with Baxter’s Amia and 
HomeChoice Claria automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) systems, where cleared for use worldwide. In addition to the comforts and convenience of home-based peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy, the cloud-based technology platform also enables designated healthcare providers to securely view and act on dialysis-related treatment data by 
remotely adjusting patients’ device settings without 
requiring them to travel to the clinic. 
In 2017, Baxter presented new findings from exploratory studies that show how Sharesource  
system data may offer healthcare providers an early indicator of impending peritonitis or evidence of PD catheter dysfunction. Diagnosing and proactively managing these factors earlier may help prevent costly complications or PD technique failure.
This treatment offers environmental advantages as well, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions related to travel and decreased use of electricity and water for treatment compared to in-clinic hemodialysis. Amia cycler also reduces materials 
use, since it is up to 40% smaller and 30% lighter than other systems on the market.

lead the industry in partnering with FDA to expand 
the pilot. By the end of 2018, Baxter expects to have several device facilities enrolled. The company is also nearing completion of a multiyear program regarding guidelines on elemental impurities to help ensure that heavy metals, such as silver, mercury and arsenic, are not present in its products above International Conference on Harmonisation-defined levels. By taking an innovative approach, Baxter is able to test for 27 different metals, confirm no unwanted materials are in its products and keep a steady supply of products on the market.  
Baxter is also working with the Ministries of Health  
and Notified Bodies in the European Union (EU) t
o prepare for the new Medical Device Regulation, 
effective at the end of 2020, which will include requirements related to clinical trials, post-market reporting, management oversight, IT systems  
and more. 
Sinc
e 2015, Baxter has experienced a substantial 
decrease in the number of observations it receives 
from regulatory agencies around the world. During late 2016 and 2017, Baxter met the necessary requirements to have three warning letters lifted by FDA for its Irvine, California; Round Lake, Illinois;  
and (former) McGaw Park, Illinois, facilities.

SUSTAINABLE DESIGN
Baxter’s product sustainability program—in partnership with the research and development, marketing and supply chain groups—embeds product stewardship across the company.The company’s Environmental, Health, Safety  
and Sustainability (EHS&S) review supports the  
company’s sustainable design efforts. This required as
sessment, or a similar analysis, occurs during the 
product development process for all new products,  
to assess environmental, health and safety, 
sustainability and regulatory considerations and requirements across the value chain. This includes high-level review as well as more detailed life cycle assessment (LCA)-based computer modeling of proposed products and may involve comparison with existing products. Key metrics illustrate progress in avoiding materials of concern, minimizing customer 
waste and reducing product carbon footprint.  
EHS&S review helps Baxter continually improve its operations, meet customer expectations and  
manage regulatory risk.
To supplement EHS&S review, Baxter uses LCA in selected cases to evaluate and improve product sustainability performance. During 2017, Baxter conducted an LCA of its Viaflo 1 Liter Intravenous Solution product, expanding on a carbon footprint analysis conducted for calendar year 2014.
4 Baxter 
estimates that the carbon footprint of a 1 liter 
equivalent Viaflo bag in the UK decreased from 0.67 kg 
CO2e in 2014 to 0.45 kg CO2e in 2016—a 33% reduction, 
due to more efficient transportation and to renewable 
electricity procurement. In addition to operating robust energy-efficiency programs, all of the facilities where Baxter manufactures Viaflo containers use 100% renewable electricity—in Spain and the UK  
since 2015, and in Ireland since 2016. The carbon f
ootprint of a 1 liter Viaflo bag for the full EU market  
is slightly higher, at 0.49 kg CO2e (see chart).During 2017, Baxter remained involved with the Sustainable  
Healthcare Coalition, of which it is a founding member. 
Baxter will continue collaborating with the organization to understand customer needs and trends related to 
sustainable healthcare and to help drive the industry forward.
MATERIALS USE
Materials use is a key driver of Baxter’s environmental 
footprint, so getting the most value possible from 
materials is central to the company’s transition toward 
a more circular economy. Reducing plastic waste and increasing recycling is important, since plastic scrap from manufacturing is the company’s largest waste stream. During 2017, Baxter reduced plastic scrap per unit of production by 4% compared to 2016, at 20 sites 
representing 88% of the company’s overall plastic volume.VIAFLO GHG EMISSIONS FOOTPRINT *

Baxter also innovates to decrease the environmental 
impact of product packaging, when possible to do so 
without adversely impacting product efficacy, by reducing the amount used and substituting with environmentally 
preferable materials. In Europe, during 2017, the company 
increased the number of Viaflo 50 milliliter IV solution bags it packed per carton from 50 to 75. This saves nearly $200,000 per year in manufacturing and transportation costs, while reducing cardboard and wood waste by more than 140 metric tons and decreasing CO
2e emissions 
associated with product transportation and cardboard manufacturing by more than 70 metric tons annually. Beginning in 2016, the company’s facility in São Paulo, 
Brazil, reduced the thickness of IV and renal fluid bags from 0.0145 inches to 0.0125 inches. As a result, Baxter saved 207 
metric tons of PVC and more than $425,000 during 2017. Since 2015, Baxter has reduced packaging globally from products shipped to customers by 870 metric tons.
Keeping materials of concern out of the waste stream can increase the value of discarded material and the potential 
for such material to be reused for other high-value purposes. Baxter has global strategies and programs to help ensure that it meets product materials restrictions, 
such as the EU RoHS2 Directive and EU REACH Regulation, 
among others. The company also works to avoid or minimize the use of conflict minerals in its products. See Baxter’s position statement on conflict minerals and its most recent Conflict Minerals Report. In addition to materials restricted by regulations, Baxter also gathers 
information about substances such as bisphenol-A (BPA) 
and latex, which are of interest to some customers.
PRODUCT END-OF-LIFE
Baxter works to recapture valuable materials for reuse at the end of product life. Some of the electronic medical devices Baxter sells, such as renal APD cyclers, support progress toward the circular economy through serviceability, repair and reuse. The company leases certain types of its electronic medical products to customers and patients, which helps ensure they have 
the technology that best meets their needs and increases 
flexibility compared to ownership. This model also 
ensures those products will be returned to Baxter after a set period of time for repair and reuse. In Europe, Baxter conducted nearly 13,600 service events of HomeChoice  
PD devices during 2017.
Regulations in many countries worldwide require 
responsible recycling of electronic products when reuse is 
no longer an option. For example, the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires manufacturers to arrange for the take-back of electronic products at end-of-life. In 2017, almost 80 metric tons of electronic products and batteries were recovered in the region on Baxter’s behalf. The company’s WEEE website  
provides customers detailed information on how to dispose of Baxter products in accordance with the directive.
Baxter also works with customers, industry peers and recycling and disposal vendors to facilitate the recycling and responsible treatment of disposable medical products. Baxter is a charter member and leads the technical working group for the Healthcare Plastics Recycling Council (HPRC), through which the organization applies its collective technical knowledge, experience and resources to address barriers to healthcare plastics recycling and drive change in the industry. 
Baxter is a co-founder of the European chapter of the HPRC. During 2017, HPRC Europe held a workshop at 
Aarhus Hospital in Denmark, bringing together recyclers, hospitals and raw material suppliers to foster connections and further the participants’ common goal of increasing 
plastics recycling at hospitals. 
In 2013, Baxter collaborated with the Vinyl Council of 
Australia (VCA) to launch the VCA’s PVC Recovery in Hospitals initiative in Australia. During 2017, the initiative expanded to reach 99 hospitals in Australia (up from 62 in 2016) and remained involved with 28 hospitals in New Zealand. Together, these locations collect more than 150 metric tons of PVC for recycling per year. Baxter added aluminum anesthesia container collection to the program in 2016, and expanded to a total of 22 hospitals in Australia and six in New Zealand in 2017. Through the initiative, the company is collecting and diverting 24 cubic meters of aluminum bottles annually from landfill.
In Australia and New Zealand, the company also helps patients who receive regular home deliveries of dialysis solutions to recycle related waste. As of the end of 2017, more than 780 Baxter PD home patients participated in the Home PD Recycling Program. The program collects and recycles nearly 110 metric tons of plastic and more than 80 metric tons of cardboard each year.cubic meters of aluminum

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT
Performance and Career Development
In 2016, Baxter simplified performance management by eliminating ratings and increasing the emphasis on 
continuous feedback. During 2017, the company moved to monthly check-ins between employees and their managers that focus on performance feedback and enhanced career development and planning. To support this shift, Baxter 
provided training to more than 10,000 employees and managers. The company included questions about the 
feedback process in its annual survey and in more frequent 
pulse surveys. Results show that employees who adhere 
to the continuous feedback model are more engaged 
and rate their managers and the company higher than employees who have not yet fully embraced the model.  
Every other year, the company’s top leaders participate 
in a 360-degree assessment, aligned with Baxter's leadership 
competencies, to help create development 
and succession plans. Baxter intends to cascade this process to all people managers globally in 2019. 
Talent Development
In addition to ongoing feedback, Baxter’s talent development philosophy emphasizes continuous 
learning, building relationships (including mentoring) and enhancing work experiences. Continuous Learning    The company provides virtual, 
online and classroom offerings worldwide on topics such as business/financial acumen, leadership, management, product knowledge and a wide range  
of job-specific skills. 
Rotational Development Programs    Employees 
develop a wide range of skills and enhance  
knowledge of Baxter through six rotational 
development programs, focused on commercial, finance, information technology, operations/quality, sales and technical skills. Learn more about rotational development programs at Baxter.
Summer Internships    To invest in its future 
workforce, Baxter hosts a 12-week internship/co-op program to provide college students with hands-on experience and networking opportunities. Participants are often invited back through Baxter’s development programs. Learn more.

Manager and Leadership Development
During 2017, Baxter implemented a range of  
programs to more fully engage its managers and driv
e effective leadership across the company, 
including leadership programs related to change management, quarterly calls about culture  
change with Baxter’s CEO and new curriculum for senior l
eaders to improve coaching and strengthen 
presentation skills. Baxter also offers various leadership development programs, including Leadership Challenge, Agile Leader, Situational Leadership, Managing the Matrix, Leading for

Transforming Company Culture
Baxter’s managers are crucial to the company’s ability 
to drive cultural change and embed Baxter’s vision and values deeper into the organization. In 2017, Baxter undertook a companywide “transformation tour.” Eighty global Change Champions engaged 55% of Baxter’s people managers through workshops focused on overcoming bureaucracy and reinforcing the decision-making power managers have to address challenges and remove obstacles. During the tour, Baxter also listened to the challenges managers raised and is using that input during 2018 to develop innovative solutions.  
Every year, Baxter conducts a Best Place to Work survey. In 2017, 83% of the company’s employees 
worldwide participated. Scores improved between one and three percentage points in each of the main areas 
assessed, and Baxter exceeded the cross-industry global average in six of seven categories. Survey results are shared broadly across Baxter, and teams create action plans to motivate continual improvement. 
Based on the results, the company is conducting a series of working sessions with managers to advance company performance and drive cultural 
change. Employees also take targeted pulse surveys 
throughout the year.
COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS
Baxter’s global total compensation philosophy is to provide market-competitive pay and benefits while 
rewarding employees for strong individual and business performance. Learn more about employee compensation  
and benefits and executive compensation at Baxter.

During 2017, Baxter focused on driving inclusive 
leadership capabilities across the company and advancing women and underrepresented minorities (U.S.) in leadership roles. Highlights of some of  
these activities include:
Gender IQ Program    Baxter has initiated a new 
leadership development program for its senior  
men and women leaders to understand and  
address gender blind spots and unconscious  
biases to foster more productive working 
r
elationships and increase the advancement of 
women at the company. 
Sponsorship    Since 2017, Baxter has formalized 
a sponsorship program to advance the careers of women and underrepresented minorities (U.S.) at the company. Baxter encourages senior leaders to advocate for high-performing, diverse talent to advance their careers.
Return-to-Work Program for Baxter Parents     
In 2017, Baxter piloted a program in the  
United States to help support new parents with  
their transition back to work after the birth  
or adoption of a child. In 2018, the company  
is developing a plan to expand the pilot program  
to benefit more employees during these  
life transitions.  Ment
oring for New Women Leaders    In 2018, 
Baxter is developing a mentoring program to help 
support successful transitions for women who  
join Baxter in senior roles.     Global Inclusion Council
Baxter’s Global Inclusion Council (GIC), chaired by 
the company’s Senior Vice President, Americas, is 
composed of approximately 15 senior leaders from the 
company’s businesses, regions and functions. These leaders serve as inclusion and diversity champions, advocates and thought leaders across the company. The GIC is responsible for advocating and driving the company’s global inclusion and diversity priorities, as well as developing and implementing local inclusion plans. In 2017, the GIC continued to focus globally on advancing women and underrepresented minorities (U.S.) in leadership and driving inclusive leadership capabilities and culture.
Building Cultural Competence
Baxter provides employees with training, tools and resources to build cultural awareness and competence, engage more authentically with each other and deliver better business results. Many employees also work on global teams, enabling them to experience other cultures and build cultural competence through daily interactions.
Baxter offers all people managers an instructor-led, mandatory workshop called Power of Managing Inclusively (available in 11 languages). The company also has an online toolkit on valuing differences, which addresses the skills and tools needed to create an inclusive and diverse culture.
Baxter works to embed awareness of unconscious bias throughout the organization. The company prompts employees to think through their biases in key processes, 
such as talent assessment, succession planning, 
feedback and hiring. This helps employees slow down their thinking and consider how to eliminate or mitigate  
unconscious bias. Baxter also encourages employees to 
practice simple acts of inclusiveness, such as learning how to pronounce co-workers’ names properly and expanding daily activities to include new people. 
Business Resource Groups
Baxter’s eight Business Resource Groups (BRGs) support the company’s inclusion and diversity goals, including the recruitment, retention and engagement of diverse employee groups. The BRGs work to enhance personal growth and multicultural understanding, while strengthening relationships among employees and with business partners, community partners and customers. Learn more.

Investing in Early  
Career Professionals
Early career professionals are the future of 
Baxter, and the company makes a significant investment to develop and train these employees. Each chapter of Baxter’s Early Career Professionals (ECP) BRG works to meet the unique needs of employees just starting out in their careers. 
The chapter operating out of the company’s 
headquarters in the United States focuses on providing opportunities to network with peers and senior leaders, take part in career development activities and engage with the local community. The group, which includes more than 950 members, held 22 events during 2017 focused on these areas. The U.S. chapter of the ECP BRG also championed the rollout of mobile wireless hotspots, providing employees with greater flexibility to work outside the office—a benefit highly valued by younger employees. In China, the ECP BRG helps employees advance their English language skills as a key component of career development. By providing these opportunities, the ECP BRG works to support Baxter’s goal to be a Best Place to Work  
for all employees.

As a global healthcare company operating in more than 
100 countries, Baxter incorporates ethics and compliance into everything it does. The company’s success is based on personal accountability for results and integrity. Patients, doctors, customers, regulators, investors and employees 
count on it. Baxter and its employees prioritize being 
honest and fair, keeping promises, encouraging questions, 
valuing discussion and following legal requirements.
COMPANYWIDE ACCOUNTABILITY
Baxter has compliance committees for each country or cluster of countries where it operates to further integrate ethics and compliance across Baxter in strategic plans and day-to-day activities. The general manager of each country/cluster attends mandatory quarterly meetings 
to discuss the country’s/cluster’s top three ethics and compliance challenges for the year. This approach, in conjunction with Baxter’s established codes, policies, trainings and monitoring and assessment practices, enables the company to more effectively target specific needs and drive ownership of and responsibility for ethics and compliance worldwide.
LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ETHICS 
AND COMPLIANCE TRAINING
In 2017, 98% of Baxter employees completed annual 
Code of Conduct training and affirmed that they have read the Code and will report any violations to the company’s Ethics and Compliance Helpline. Baxter 
employees also complete online courses relevant to their 
jobs, covering topics such as adverse event reporting, the company’s ethics and compliance standards, data 
privacy, Baxter’s Global Interactions Policy, trade compliance and workplace violence prevention. In addition to the anticorruption content covered by 
the Code of Conduct training, the Baxter sales force 
participates in training workshops related to interactions with the medical community and government officials.THIRD PARTY PROGRAM
Baxter is committed to conducting business with integrity and in compliance with the law wherever it operates. The company’s Third Party Program, policy, and training outline the standards and processes used to review, retain and monitor new and existing third parties for compliance with the company’s anticorruption expectations. The program and policy apply to all Baxter employees, officers and directors involved in review, retention and monitoring of third parties. Through December 2017, more than 5,000 Baxter employees were trained on the company’s Third Party Program, in addition to the anticorruption content covered by Code of Conduct training. Baxter also provides training to all new and existing third parties.DRIVING A CULTURE OF ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE

COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENTS
Baxter completes risk audits and assessments at 
least annually, and more often as needed. These cover 
corruption, among other topics. The Corporate Audit and Ethics and Compliance functions select the locations of operations to audit and assess based on factors such as size, Transparency International’s Corruption Perception 
Index, the nature of interactions with the medical community and third parties, industry trends, and the results of local and regional compliance monitoring and investigations. These assessments may focus on 
relationships with third parties, considering possible risk factors such as the nature of the working arrangement with Baxter, adherence to contractual terms and the company's Ethics and Compliance Standards for Baxter Suppliers, the level of interaction with governments and healthcare professionals, and training history and needs.
In 2017, the company conducted three compliance assessments using Corporate Audit and Ethics and Compliance resources: one each in the Americas; Asia Pacific; and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. The assessments showed continued progress in awareness, understanding and implementation of Baxter’s anticorruption programs.
COMPLIANCE MONITORING
During 2017, Baxter completed the development and testing of an automated compliance monitoring system. This enables Baxter to shift from manual, sample-based monitoring to automated monitoring across all relevant transactions, which will help the company more thoroughly assess events that may raise concerns. This system screens expenses related to travel and entertainment and interactions with healthcare professionals, as well as some data related to third-party operations. The company is formally launching the automated program in seven countries during 2018 and will continue to transition more countries in coming years. 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH  
HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND 
GO
VERNMENT OFFICIALS
Baxter is committed to transparent reporting about 
relationships with the medical community and government officials. This includes the continued implementation of anticorruption programs to ensure that those relationships and related payments are for necessary and genuine services. The company’s Global Interactions Policy outlines when and how it is acceptable to provide members of the medical community or government officials with any payment of monetary value or other benefit.
Baxter has local Contributions Management Committees, which act as independent entities to review and process contribution requests—such as for community and patient education events and activities to increase disease awareness—from nonprofit and for-profit healthcare organizations. 
ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE HELPLINE
In 2017, Baxter logged 343 reports from 30 countries into its Ethics and Compliance Helpline system, and closed 287.
Not all of the reports involved allegations of misconduct. All reports were promptly triaged and have either been addressed or are in the process of being addressed.
PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION
Baxter respects the privacy of its patients, employees and customers. The company's Global Privacy Policy defines Baxter's privacy standards and guides the company's global operations to follow similar controls for protecting personal information. All Baxter employees are required

INJURIES AND MAJOR INCIDENTS
Baxter regularly evaluates the company’s main 
sources of work-related injuries to identify trends and 
opportunities for improvement. 
When a major incident occurs at Baxter, facility 
management conducts an evaluation and follows formal processes and reporting mechanisms to share knowledge companywide and prevent recurrence. Major incidents are defined as those that result in an employee or contractor being hospitalized overnight (for more than observation), sustaining an amputation or dying. 
Major incidents decreased at Baxter in 2017 (seven, none 
involving contractors) compared to 2016 (eight, none 
involving contractors), and no fatalities occurred. 
ENHANCING SAFETY CULTURE AND 
PERFORMANCE
In 2017, based on a review of historical performance 
trends, Baxter further enhanced its safety culture and performance through detailed safety action plans for 
targeted facilities, increased oversight of case reporting (with recordkeeping audits), and completion of corrective and preventive actions following major injuries.
Focused Injury- and Illness-  
Reduction Strategies
Injury and illness metrics and internal EHS&S audits 
provide focus for the company’s safety, occupational health and industrial hygiene efforts. Baxter continues  to target ergonomics and slips, trips and falls, two of  
the primary sources of injury at the company.
Emphasis On High-Hazard Sources
During 2017, Baxter continued to categorize all EHS&S incidents by potential severity, and worked to determine the root causes of incidents, correct them and prevent recurrence. Baxter continued its Safety Alert system to enhance learning from major incidents. The system requires applicable sites to verify awareness of occurrences, associated risks  
and any needed remediation.
HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM 
MANAGEMENT AND INITIATIVES
Baxter’s occupational health function, in partnership with 
Human Resources and Global Communications, develops the company’s health and wellness strategies. A global team of diverse health professionals and volunteers, known as Local Champions, helps refine and implement these approaches and define priorities.
Bewell@Baxter
Healthy employees are more engaged 
and productive and less vulnerable to safety incidents and injuries. Through 
BeWell@Baxter, the company’s global employee health and wellness effort, Baxter strives to create a culture that promotes work-related and personal health, raises awareness about these issues, and drives individual accountability and engagement.
The cornerstone of BeWell@Baxter is the Personal 
Wellness Profile, an online health risk assessment that helps employees understand how lifestyle choices, family history and other factors influence health and related risks. The company uses this data to focus its 
health promotion program on areas of highest health risk for employees. As of the end of 2017, 30% of 
Baxter’s employees worldwide had completed a Personal Wellness Profile.

Baxter is committed to driving sustainability 
throughout its global manufacturing operations.1 
The company strives to use energy, water and raw materials efficiently, while reducing waste and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This improves 
environmental performance while saving money and 
enhancing Baxter’s reputation.
The company’s Environmental, Health, Safety 
and Sustainability (EHS&S) vision is to achieve a 
sustainable enterprise that creates stakeholder value 
by advancing superior environmental stewardship, optimum employee health and well-being, and a zero-harm workplace. Baxter’s EHS&S Policy outlines 
the company’s commitments within its operations and across the value chain. The company’s EHS&S governance structure helps the organization achieve its goals and create long-term business value.
Baxter follows a management-systems approach guided by its global EHS&S requirements. The company applies the ISO 14001 standard to manage its environmental aspects and the OHSAS 18001 standard to manage its health and safety hazards and risks. As of year-end 2017, 61 Baxter locations met the requirements of ISO 14001  
and 46 sites were certified to OHSAS 18001.
The company's EHS&S audit program helps to ensure that Baxter facilities have programs that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements and are consistent with the company’s EHS&S requirements, objectives and goals. In 2017, Baxter conducted EHS&S audits at 20 facilities.
With regard to environmental compliance, Baxter received five environmental Notices of Violation (NOVs) in 2017 and paid $4,727 in environmental fines. The company settled two health and safety NOVs during the year, and paid $8,500 in health and safety fines. Reduce environmental footprint through increased

ENERGY  
Using energy effectively enhances business efficiency, 
conserves natural resources and improves environmental performance. Reducing fossil fuel combustion decreases GHG emissions, improves air quality and decreases fine particulates that contribute to adverse health effects.
Baxter has a goal to reduce total energy use by 15% indexed to revenue by 2020, from a 2015 baseline. In 2017, the company used 9,011 trillion joules of energy—5% less than in 2015, indexed to revenue. This includes electricity, fuel and purchased steam used by Baxter-managed and Baxter-operated facilities and excludes energy related to company-operated vehicles. In 2017, Baxter decreased absolute energy use by 1% compared to 2016 despite facility expansions and production increases, due primarily to the consolidation of certain facilities.Energy conservation supports Baxter’s business because energy is one of the company’s most significant manufacturing costs. The company’s energy costs dropped 3% between 2016 and 2017, saving $4.1 million, due to reduced energy use and lower energy prices.
Site-specific energy assessments identify 
opportunities to conserve energy and to apply and share new technologies and best practices across the company. In 2017, Baxter performed energy assessments at nine facilities worldwide. From those, the company identified 134 potential energy and water conservation projects, with possible annual savings of $3.4 million. Facility personnel also uncover possible energy conservation projects.
During 2017, Baxter implemented 210 energy 
conservation projects that saved more than $4.6 million and 202 trillion joules of energy on an annual basis, avoiding more than 9,300 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
2e) of GHG emissions.
Responsible energy procurement is integral to Baxter’s GHG emissions reduction strategy. At manufacturing sites in Europe, the company increased renewable power use to 97% of total electricity in 2017 from 65% in 2016, while saving $3.0 million through its global energy sourcing strategy.
Baxter has operated a Lean Energy Program for the company’s main manufacturing facilities since 2007. 
It includes four sets of Lean Energy standards—
Prerequisite, Bronze, Silver and Gold. Each defines 14 to 35 requirements a facility must meet at that level, with a focus on process and system energy efficiency. By year-end 2017, 42 sites achieved Prerequisite status, 39 achieved Bronze, 22 achieved Silver and 6 achieved Gold status.The Baxter global energy program began to apply the ISO 50001 standard in 2014 to its facility-level energy management systems. By the end of 2017, nine company locations met ISO 50001 requirements, as verified by an accredited third party.  Additionally, during the year Baxter’s corporate energy management program received an ISO 50001 Group Certificate.
WATER AND WASTEWATER
Water issues continue to grow in importance worldwide. Although these concerns are global, they must be addressed at the local and regional levels. Baxter works to better understand the impacts of its water use across the value chain and implements conservation and efficiency projects at its manufacturing facilities.VIEW THE DATA SUMMARY AND VALUE

CommunitiesIntroduction
Baxter has a goal to reduce total water use by 15% 
indexed to revenue by 2020, from its 2015 baseline. The company reduced water consumption by 5% indexed to revenue from 2015 to 2017.
During 2017, Baxter used approximately 14 million cubic meters of water,
2 roughly equivalent to filling 15 
Olympic-size swimming pools every day. This represents a reduction in water usage of 1% in absolute terms and 4% indexed to revenue, compared to 2016.
Baxter considers several factors to identify water use reduction opportunities and possible water conservation projects at sites, including total water used, water usage efficiency, and water cost and availability. Due to the strong link between energy use and water processing, optimizing water systems remains a key focus of the company’s facility energy assessments. Additionally, Baxter integrates lean manufacturing principles and tools such as value stream mapping
3 with water management to help 
facilities identify areas for additional conservation. The company has already implemented many projects to decrease water use, leaving future reduction more difficult. Moreover, Baxter anticipates that business growth and manufacturing process changes will continue to present challenges in this area.
During 2017, the Baxter facility in São Paulo, Brazil, 
reduced total water use by 15,200 cubic meters 
compared to 2016. The site has implemented numerous 
projects during the last several years that have significantly reduced water use, such as decreasing 
reverse osmosis reject water, reducing discharge water from stills, optimizing sterilization cycles and a range of 
water recovery projects.
Water issues vary significantly by location. In 2016, 
Baxter applied the World Business Council for  
Sustainable Development's Global Water Tool to 
evaluate the availability of renewable water supply at the company’s 60 largest water-use locations for which the tool provided data. These locations represented 96% of Baxter’s total water use. In 2017, facility water use in extreme water-scarcity, water-scarce and water-stressed areas combined increased by 6% in absolute terms and 2% indexed to revenue compared to 2016. This is primarily due to construction of a new plant in China.
Wastewater
Managing wastewater discharged from Baxter’s production operations is one of the company’s most significant environmental priorities. In 2017, seven of 
Baxter’s nine self-reported environmental incidents were exceedances of permitted wastewater discharge limits.
To address existing wastewater compliance issues globally and to prepare for potential future ones, Baxter pursues an aggressive approach to wastewater compliance, evaluation and risk mitigation. Based on recent experience, the company has implemented a systematic wastewater risk management program that proactively identifies emerging issues. This involves a holistic review of major manufacturing locations that includes the following:
• Ev aluate effectiveness of facility change management

WASTE
Baxter identifies leading waste reduction opportunities 
based on its highest-volume waste streams, facilities that produce the most waste, sites with strong potential to improve, and other factors. The company tracks  
and analyzes waste data from each major facility to as
sess progress toward waste reduction goals and 
identify ways to improve processes that generate waste. VIEW THE DATA SUMMARY FOR MORE DETAIL.14

Facilities measure waste at the point of generation to 
rapidly identify significant sources. These and other activities reduce expenses related to raw materials use, waste handling and disposal.
During 2017, Baxter’s operations generated 71,000 metric tons of total waste, up 2% from 2015 in absolute terms and 4% less indexed to revenue.
4 
The company’s operations generated 62,900 metric 
tons of nonhazardous waste during 2017, a 2% reduction in absolute terms and a 6% decrease indexed to revenue, compared to 2016. Baxter attributes this change to initiatives implemented at some of the company’s largest manufacturing 
facilities. In 2017, Baxter’s Hechingen, Germany, site reduced nonhazardous waste by 18% (604 metric tons) compared to the prior year through various process changes.Reducing plastic waste and increasing recycling is important, since plastic scrap from manufacturing  
is Baxter’s largest waste stream, representing roughly one-third of the company’s nonhazardous waste. Baxter also innovates to mitigate the environmental impact of product packaging. Read more in Product Innovation.
Regulated waste5 represents 11% of Baxter’s total 
waste. During 2017, the company’s operations generated 8,100 metric tons of regulated waste, 6% less in absolute terms than in 2016, and 10% less indexed to revenue. This decrease was due to improvements in regulated waste material handling. 
For example, a project implemented at Baxter facilities in Opelika, Alabama, and Hechingen, Germany, reduced regulated waste by 860 metric tons, of which 66% had previously gone to landfill. Adding a drum dryer enabled the sites to remove  
and reuse the hazardous liquid portion from the w
aste and then recycle the remaining content.
In 2017, Baxter recycled 78% of nonhazardous waste and 60% of regulated waste for an overall recycling rate of 76%. Recycling at Baxter generated nearly $4.9 million in net income in 2017.
6
Baxter has a goal to pursue zero waste-to-landfill  
by achieving a landfill diversion rate of 95% or higher at all manuf
acturing locations by 2020. In 2017,  
18 manufacturing sites (more than 30% of the total) and one R&D f
acility achieved or exceeded this rate.

Multinational companies can help address climate 
change by understanding their impacts across the value chain and decreasing GHG emissions. These are core elements of Baxter’s sustainability efforts.
Baxter began reporting its Scope 1, Scope 2 and  
certain Scope 3 GHG emissions in 1997 and 
contributed to the development of the initial version of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a collaboration of 
the World Resources Institute and the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development.
Baxter estimates its 2017 GHG emissions footprint (Scope 1, 2 and 3) at 4.7 million metric tons CO
2e,7  
down 7% from the prior year. The main factor 
contributing to this reduction was GHG emissions associated with the use of certain products for which production and sales decreased in 2017. 
Since 2015, Baxter has offset GHG emissions related 
to global business travel with United Airlines through the CarbonChoice program. During 2017, this included 4,413 metric tons CO
2e offset on Baxter’s behalf 
through the Asorpar Colombian Reforestation project, a Verified Carbon Standard/Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standard project.
GHG EMISSIONS FROM OPERATIONS 
Energy use accounts for 98% of Baxter’s GHG 
emissions from operations, so the company focuses its reduction efforts in this area. In 2017, Baxter facilities 
completed 210 energy-conservation projects that reduced annual GHG emissions by more than 9,300 metric tons CO
2e. Other tactics include fuel switching, 
cogeneration, onsite renewable energy systems, renewable power procurement and green buildings.
Baxter has a goal to reduce absolute GHG emissions from operations by 10% by 2020, compared to 2015. Through 2017, the company reduced GHG emissions from operations by 17%, exceeding its goal. Total net emissions from operations equaled 573,000 metric tons CO
2e in 2017, including a subtraction of 185,200 
metric tons CO2e of carbon credits.
By the end of 2017, 30% of the company’s energy use for operations was from renewable sources. Biomass fuel for boilers at three company locations8 represented 
11% of total energy use, and the renewable energy component of purchased electricity and renewable energy certificates together represented 19%. On-site geothermal, solar photovoltaic and solar hot water systems contributed a small amount.
Baxter’s energy procurement team works to provide sustainable and economical energy to all 
manufacturing sites. During 2017, the company sourced more than 230,000 MWh of 100% renewable electricity 
for Baxter’s European manufacturing sites. This represented 97% of total electricity for manufacturing in the region, up from 65% in 2016. In most cases, savings from the company’s comprehensive global energy sourcing strategy finance the premium for green electricity contracts.
Globally in 2017, Baxter purchased more than 345,000 MWh of electricity generated from 100% certified renewable power, a 21% increase from 2016, including all electricity purchased by the company in Illinois. 
Baxter was recognized as the 28th largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the United States during the year.
9  
Since 2007, Baxter has maintained carbon neutrality at its headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois, through electricity generated from certified renewable energy sources. The company offsets facility-related emissions from purchased electricity and from fuel combusted on-site.

Managing Procurement Risks
Baxter takes a risk-based approach to managing 
corporate responsibility issues in its supply chain. The company’s Supplier Quality Standards and Ethics and Compliance Standards for Baxter Suppliers outline expectations and requirements for all of its suppliers.Supplier Corporate  
Responsibility Survey
Baxter conducts an annual Supplier Corporate 
Responsibility Survey to better understand the performance of its suppliers and drive continuous improvement. To assess 2017 performance, the 
company released an updated, more robust version of the survey, which covers program governance as well as environmental, social and health and safety aspects. Baxter invited 220 suppliers to provide information about their programs and performance by taking the survey, and 66% participated. Of those, 38% were from the Americas; 40% from Europe, Middle East and Africa; and 23% from Asia Pacific.
2 Baxter will send 
participating suppliers a report card based on the data they provided to encourage ongoing improvement. Supplier Audits
Baxter’s Supplier Sustainability team works with its 
Environment, Health, Safety and Sustainability team to conduct supplier audits. The audit format aligns with the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) protocol, covering ethics; labor; environment, health and safety; and related management systems.
From the launch of the pilot program in 2016  
through the end of 2017, Baxter conducted eight 
supplier sus
tainability audits: one in the Asia Pacific 
region, two in EMEA and five in the Americas.  
To drive continuous improvement and help suppliers adv
ance their sustainability programs, Baxter works 
with suppliers to develop corrective action plans for identified nonconformances.

Supplier Diversity
Baxter develops mutually beneficial relationships with 
small and diverse suppliers, and continually works to increase the diversity of its supplier base.
The company spent $347 million in 2017 with small 
suppliers in the United States and Puerto Rico, down 6% 
compared to 2016, due to overall reductions in supply 
chain spending during the year. In those locations, the company spent $84 million during the year with women-owned businesses and $40 million with minority-owned firms. Veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, small disadvantaged and HUBZone-certified businesses represented $5.1 million, $0.6 million, $13.1 million and $0.7 million of Baxter’s spending, respectively.
3
Baxter also works to develop the capability of diverse suppliers through targeted match-maker conferences and networking events. In 2017, the company hosted its second annual Supplier Diversity Fair at its corporate headquarters. The half-day networking event educated small, minority-owned, women-owned and other diverse business enterprises on best practices for conducting business with Baxter.
The company also continues to support diverse supplier development through the executive management program at Northwestern University. Since 2014, Baxter has sponsored rising minority business enterprises through its support of the 
Advanced Management Education Program (AMEP) in partnership with the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and the National Minority Supplier Development Council.
The company recognizes employees and suppliers that help advance supplier diversity at the company. During 2017, Baxter recognized one senior executive with a Supplier Diversity Leadership Award, one purchasing manager with a Supplier Diversity Champion Award and one supplier as Supplier of the Year.
Baxter maintains corporate membership in the National 
Minority Supplier Development Council, National Gay 
& Lesbian Chamber of Commerce and U.S. Business Leadership Network. The company also supports diversity through local business partners including the Chicago Minority Supplier Development Council, 
Women’s Business Development Center, Chicago United and Chicagoland Business Leadership Network.

The company is a member of PSCI, a healthcare 
industry group focused on responsible procurement, 
risk mitigation and supplier capability building. Baxter encourages its suppliers to participate in the PSCI supply chain audit program and leverage other PSCI capability-building opportunities. In addition, the company takes part in the PSCI Supplier Capability Building Committee and several sub-committees to establish industrywide best practices, including those related to management  systems, human rights, and ethics and compliance in  the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries.
As a corporate member of the Sustainable Purchasing 
Leadership Council, Baxter works to advance the organization’s mission of supporting and recognizing purchasing leadership that accelerates the transition to a prosperous and sustainable future. In 2017, Baxter 
continued to collaborate with other member organizations to establish best practices for supplier development and to help suppliers advance sustainability within their companies.
Baxter’s efforts to establish a secure supply chain include participating in programs such as the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism Program (C-TPAT), which supports a secure and reliable supply of lifesaving medical products. This includes shipments of raw materials and 
finished products both to and from various Baxter locations, foreign suppliers, distributors and customers. As an importer and exporter, Baxter has been recognized as a Tier III Partner (the highest level possible) in the program since 2011. 
GREEN LOGISTICS
Baxter transports more than 5 million metric tons of raw materials and finished goods each year throughout its global supply chain. The company mainly partners with third-party vendors and carriers. In some instances, Baxter operates its 
own product distribution system, such as a private fleet for renal product home delivery in certain countries.The company’s worldwide greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from product transport totaled 453,300 metric 
tons CO2e in 2017, equivalent to 91 kilograms CO2e per 
metric ton of products transported, a 22% increase from 2016. The primary reasons were an increase in 
shipped volumes and Baxter’s response to the disruption 
of typical product distribution activities caused by Hurricane Maria in the Caribbean. 
Baxter manufactures Mini-Bag and Mini-Bag Plus   
(small volume parenterals) Container Systems in Puerto 
Rico. To help support product supply for the U.S. market, Baxter activated targeted recovery strategies across its global manufacturing network, including working with U.S. Food and Drug Administration to secure regulatory 
discretion for the temporary special importation of 
certain products from Baxter facilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, Ireland, Italy, and Mexico. While this increased Baxter’s air transport emissions, it was critical to the company’s ability to continue providing products to patients and healthcare providers. In 2018, Baxter will continue working to reduce product transport emissions.
Baxter’s approach to improving efficiency and decreasing GHG emissions from product transport includes:
Intermodal transport    
Combining multiple transportation 
modes for a single shipment—for example, converting 
road to rail for parts of a route—can decrease costs and overall GHG emissions. Although Hurricane Maria disrupted Baxter’s ability to take full advantage of 
intermodal transport options in the Caribbean during 2017, 
the company continued to make strides elsewhere. In an 
effort to replace air freight with ocean and rail wherever 
possible, Baxter has implemented an air approval 
process in Asia Pacific; Latin America; and Europe, 
the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), which requires all large, unplanned shipments to receive senior manager 
approval. The number of air shipments decreased by 9%, 
excluding air shipments associated with the disruption 
caused by Hurricane Maria. In EMEA, the company 
continued converting its road freight to rail. During 2017, rail represented 13% of total land shipments in that region. The company has also begun to pilot use of rail from 
Europe to China, instead of air. Overall, Baxter used 
rail for approximately 8% of its land freight globally in 2017.
Optimizing the distribution network    The use of 
innovative technologies, such as transport management systems and route optimization tools, saves time and money while improving environmental performance. In 2017, Baxter implemented a first-in-industry ocean export consolidation center for the majority of its EMEA export shipments. The center combines shipments from different warehouse locations in Europe and optimizes the loads, which reduces the total number of containers while increasing supply frequency.
Environmentally responsible partnerships    Baxter is 
one of a select number of companies that participate in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's SmartWay  
program as both a Carrier and Shipper Partner.WORLDWIDE GHG EMISSIONS FROM PRODUCT TRANSPORT

Baxter products save and sustain lives. According to  
the World Health Organization, at least 400 million 
peopl
e globally lack access to one or more essential 
health services. For this reason, the company is dedicated to increasing access to healthcare in communities through public and private partnerships and capacity-building grants. Along with its partners, Baxter is committed to being first on scene in times of crisis with product and resource donations.
ADVANCING PUBLIC HEALTH
Baxter collaborates with other organizations to expand the availability of its treatments and to advance public health. This includes educating current and potential patients worldwide, as well as training physicians and other healthcare professionals. The company also enters into public-private partnerships to share best practices in manufacturing and treatment. Additionally, Baxter collaborates with governments, companies and other organizations to influence policy and standards that promote patient access to therapy and products.
Sharing Best Practices for End-Stage 
Renal Disease Treatment
In 2012, Baxter and the Chinese National Health  
and Family Planning Commission launched the 
"Fl
ying Angel" program that focused on a sustainable 
care and delivery model for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with end-stage renal disease in rural  
parts of China.The strategic partnership covered provincial, 
municipal and county level medical institutions in six 
pilot provinces. As a part of the initiative, outcomes of hemodialysis and PD therapy were compared, demonstrating equal effectiveness, while PD  
involves lower cost. In addition, the establishment  
of outpatient services for PD care increased the number of PD ph
ysicians and nurses and enhanced 
treatment capabilities in local medical institutions.  
 As a result of this partnership, which came to an  
end in 2018, thousands of patients benefited from  
a higher standard of care, expanded infrastructure, and impr
oved accessibility and affordability of PD 
therapy in China.
During 2017, Baxter laid the groundwork to provide underserved populations in Indonesia improved access to renal care. The company facilitated a meeting between the Indonesian and Colombian ministries of health to share information about Colombia's healthcare system, its focus on renal disease, and Baxter's role in providing care in that country through Renal Therapy Services. Baxter plans to launch several pilot projects in Indonesia during 2018 using a similar approach.
In 2018, Baxter and the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) announced a partnership to  
advance chronic kidney disease awareness and 
help improve access to therapy, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC)—commonly referred to as emerging markets—where the disease prevalence is growing the fastest. The collaboration will support greater disease and therapy research and education, as well as work to help establish better care models that support high standards of care at a lower cost in LMIC.Improve access to healthcare for the underserved

PUBLIC POLICY
Many legislative issues affect Baxter’s business globally, including reimbursement, tax, trade and a variety of regulatory concerns. The company’s Government Policy and Reimbursement team works with lawmakers, governments and policymakers worldwide to support patient access to the company’s lifesaving therapies, improve the regulatory environment and reimbursement structure for Baxter’s therapies, increase understanding of the benefits of those therapies and address barriers to care. This involves engaging with governments to improve the regulatory environment and reimbursement structure for Baxter’s therapies and collaborating with clinicians, nongovernmental organizations and patient groups to increase access to healthcare for millions of people worldwide.
See Baxter’s 2017 Political Contributions Report for details about the company’s political contributions as well as its membership in certain trade and industry groups.
During 2017, Baxter’s key public policy focus areas included the following:
Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization  
Act of 2017    Baxter, along with AdvaMed (the medical 
technology association) and the Association for 
Accessible Medicines (the generic pharmaceutical and 
biosimilars association) supported U.S. Congressional 
passage of the Food and Drug Administration  
Reauthorization Act of 2017. This legislation is intended to improve the process for regulatory advancement and approval of new treatments, and will help enhance the innovation ecosystem for medical technology, biosimilars, generic pharmaceuticals, innovator pharmaceuticals and biologics.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017    Baxter supported U.S. Congressional passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  
Act of 2017. This legislation is intended to provide tax relief for businesses and individuals.
Home Dialysis    Baxter belongs to the Alliance for Home Dialysis, an organization focused on advocacy, 
policy and thought leadership. The company 
participated in the 2017 Alliance for Home Dialysis Capitol Hill Briefing in Washington, DC, to further the dialogue about the benefits of home dialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease. The workshop provided a forum for the home dialysis community and U.S. Congressional staff to discuss emerging policy opportunities to ensure patient choice in treatment.
Home Delivery of Renal Products    In the United 
States, state-level laws and regulations govern pharmaceuticals dispensing. Baxter works to help shape state policies to better align with the company’s Renal Home Patient service.
Supporting Diverse Populations    During 2017, Baxter representatives attended the National  
Minority Quality Forum Summit, the Congressional Black Caucus F
oundation Annual Legislative 
Conference, the National Black Caucus of State Legislators Annual Meeting and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Public Policy Conference  
to learn more about health disparities affecting div
erse populations and engage key leaders about 
Baxter’s efforts to serve our patients with end-stage renal disease, which disproportionately impacts minority populations.

teacher training and student development in the health 
sciences. In 2017, the company provided funding for two Baxter Innovation Labs, expanding the program beyond CPS for the first time. One opened at Lindblom Math and Science Academy, a selective enrollment high school in Chicago, Illinois, in December of that year. The second will open in late 2018 at College of Lake County in Grayslake, Illinois (see above). Baxter is pursuing other opportunities to expand the program in locations where the company has a presence.COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
Baxter capitalizes on its global reach to serve communities 
in enduring ways through partnerships, donations, matching 
gifts and employee volunteering. 
In 2017, the company engaged in a collaboration with the NGO 
Fundación Solar in Guatemala to reduce natural resource use, improve community health, provide access to clean drinking water and empower women in Aguacatán, Huehuetenango. 
Other participants include the Guatemalan Ministry of the Environment, Universidad del Valle and the United Nations. The project will deliver community members water filtration 
tanks to purify harvested rainwater, wood-burning stoves that 
are safer and more energy-efficient than the traditional method of open-fire cooking, and education about natural resource stewardship. This initiative builds on water and sanitation projects that Baxter has conducted in recent years with the Philippine Center for Water and Sanitation in Sitio Silangan, near the company’s manufacturing facility  
in Canlubang, Philippines, and with Sarar Transformación SC, near Ba
xter’s facility in Cuernavaca, Mexico.
Disaster Relief
In 2017, natural disasters, including Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, significantly impacted the company’s communities, operations and employees. Immediately after the storm passed, Baxter began helping its more than 2,000 employees in Puerto Rico procure necessities 
such as gasoline, food, water and toiletries. The 
company coordinated multiple daily flights to transport 
approximately 25,000 pounds of needed supplies 
for employees. Baxter also distributed gas-powered 
generators and propane cooktops, and installed laundry 
stations at its manufacturing facilities to support employees’ personal needs. In addition, employees 
worldwide collected needed items for colleagues, and 
teams sent toys, games and other holiday gifts for employees’ children. The company continues to provide the communities around its manufacturing facilities with access to potable water as well as supplies and other aid.
Baxter and the Baxter International Foundation provided 
short-term recovery grants to its partners American 
Red Cross, Americares and Direct Relief. The Baxter International Foundation also matched employee gifts made through the company’s disaster relief portal two-to-one. These funds were donated to help in the areas with the greatest need. 
Additionally, the company launched the Baxter Employee 
Disaster Relief Fund, a global program, that enables 
employees to donate funds to help fellow employees 
impacted by disasters. The Baxter International Foundation committed to provide startup funds as well, enabling all 
qualified employee applicants to receive a grant.
Matching Gifts
The Baxter International Foundation Matching Gift Program 
matches employee donations of $25 or more, up to $5,000 
each year, to qualifying U.S. public charities.1

2020 PRIORITIES AND GOALS
1	This represents the total savings attributable to identified projects across the company, counted only for the first year the packaging 
innovation was implemented. 
2 Based on McKinsey & Company data for global gender benchmark and Diversity Best Practices data for U.S. ethnic  
minority benchmark.
3 Dat a are from Aon Hewitt. The global average represent approximately 500 companies and approximately 11 million employees.  
Top quartile is a subset of the global average.
4 In a c omparison of 50 global companies across all industries, 44 reported global safety data to ORC HSE and six reported data on 
their public websites.
5 Includes spending with w omen-owned businesses and minority-owned businesses. Spending with suppliers that qualify for both 
categories is included in the total for each category. United States and Puerto Rico. Fiscal year basis (October 1 through September 30 of the year noted).
PRODUCT INNOVATION
1	United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, “World population projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050,” http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/2015-report.html. Last accessed February 2018.
2 Ba xter’s products, facilities and operations are subject to regulation by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other 
regulatory authorities worldwide. These agencies administer requirements covering the testing, safety, efficacy, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, distribution and post-market surveillance of Baxter’s products.
3 W arning letters are FDA's principle means of achieving prompt compliance with regulations before it initiates any legal 
enforcement action.
4 This L CA was independently verified to the ISO 14044 and ISO 14067 standards.
EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY
1 Beginning in 2011, pr ofiles untouched for three years were removed from the active database. As of the beginning of 2016 the 
participation rate was 27%.
OPERATIONS
1 The envir onmental data included in this report are based on 134 reporting locations, of which 60 are manufacturing, 26 are 
warehouse, and 48 are pharmacies, administrative, clerical or other. Several of the reporting units comprise multiple locations that report as a single entity. For example, in 2017, Baxter’s 52 renal therapy sites in Colombia reported as a single entity. The reporting scope excludes certain leased facilities for which environmental performance data are not available or are not material to Baxter’s overall environmental performance. The health and safety data included in this report are based on 164 reporting locations. The EHS&S information reported covers 100% of Baxter’s operations unless noted otherwise. EHS&S data are revised to reflect acquisitions, divestitures and plant closings as well as to incorporate any corrections necessary due to additional data verification activities (such as EHS&S audits). See the Baxter Data Summary for additional detail.
2 One cubic met er equals 1,000 liters or 264 gallons.
3 W ater value stream mapping is an interactive, lean manufacturing tool that helps facilities better understand the quantity and 
quality of water used in their processes and identify opportunities for reduction or reuse.
4 To more closely reflect production efficiency and support consistent evaluation of facility performance and trends, Baxter excludes certain non-routine, non-production-related waste streams from its total waste performance data and progress against its 2020 waste goal. These waste streams are construction and demolition debris, remediation waste and wastewater treatment sludge.
5 Baxter reports “regulated waste” rather than “hazardous waste.” This term includes some materials that would otherwise be classified as nonhazardous in some countries, which helps Baxter harmonize its waste reporting across locations. In addition to wastes typically considered hazardous (such as toxics and corrosives), the company also includes oils, biohazardous or infectious materials, batteries, fluorescent lamps, asbestos and other materials that may not be defined as hazardous waste by national legislation at the point of origin.
6 Inciner ation with energy recovery is considered recycling.
7 The company’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have a high level of certainty and have been verified for the past seven years to a reasonable assurance level by Bureau Veritas North America. Scope 3 categories are based on various assumptions and estimates. For the past five years, Bureau Veritas North America has verified to a limited assurance level Baxter’s methodology and emissions factors for calculating Scope 3 GHG emissions. The market-based method is used for Scope 2 unless otherwise stated. Data in this report are presented in accordance with the GHG Protocol (Scope 1 and Scope 2) and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.OPERATIONS  (continued )
8 In 2017, Baxter used biomass fuels to generate energy in boilers at three Baxter locations in the United States, India and Italy. 
During the year, emissions from the Baxter-operated biomass boilers equaled 146,000 metric tons CO2. In accordance with the GHG 
Protocol, these are not included in reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. However, also in accordance with the GHG Protocol, the company includes CO
2e emissions from the CH4 and N2O components of biomass combustion in its reported Scope 1 emissions.

Sustainability (EHS&S) organization and the categorization of data in the EHS&S global information management system 
through 2017.
5 W ork-related injuries or illnesses requiring medical attention beyond first-aid, including cases with days lost. All rates based on 100 full-
time employees working one year, which equals 200,000 work hours. For tracking purposes, Baxter follows U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordkeeping requirements worldwide. Thus, in cases where an injury occurs and conflicting medical opinions arise as to the number of days away and/or restricted days that should be recorded, Baxter records on the basis of the most authoritative physician’s opinion. Rates exclude acquisitions until January 1 of the first year following at least 18 months with Baxter. Baxter includes occupational diseases and illnesses, such as hearing loss and ergonomic disorders, within its broader categories of cases, but does not track or report those items separately. Due to privacy regulations in the company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa region, Baxter does not classify or report injuries by gender. Supervised contracted employees are included in the injury statistics reported below and are not tracked separately. Independent contractors are not included in Baxter’s injury data, because they are supervised by other organizations. 
6 W ork-related injuries or illnesses that cause an employee to lose at least one full day after the date of the incident. 
7 The number of da ys lost (including weekends and holidays) recommended by the most authoritative physician’s opinion due to work-

BAXTER DATA SUMMARY  (continued )
14 Ba xter’s Lean Energy Program began in 2007. Early in 2016, Baxter introduced new Lean Energy Program requirements and updated 
some existing ones to better align the program with ISO 50001 requirements for energy management.  
15 Ex cludes waste associated with U.S. Renal Home Care operations, since patients dispose of unused product rather than returning it to 
Baxter for disposal. Also excludes construction and demolition debris, remediation waste and wastewater treatment sludge. Removing 
these waste categories from the company total allows for more consistent evaluation of facility performance and trends over time. In 2017, Baxter reclassified a waste stream as wastewater, thereby excluding it from waste calculations. Baxter has restated its waste performance for 2015 and 2016.
16 Excludes production by-products reused on-site, construction and demolition debris and wastewater treatment sludge. Includes discarded/returned products (such as intravenous solution, dextrose solution, etc.) that are nonhazardous in nature but may be classified as regulated in some countries. Excludes waste associated with U.S. Renal Home Care operations, since patients dispose of unused product rather than returning it to Baxter for disposal. 
17 Excludes waste recycled on-site, remediation waste, construction and demolition debris and wastewater treatment sludge. Includes certain waste streams (such as waste oils, batteries, fluorescent lamps, light ballasts and asbestos) not classified as regulated in some locations. In 2017, Baxter reclassified a waste stream as wastewater, thereby excluding it from waste calculations. Baxter has restated its waste performance for 2015 and 2016.
18 Water usage from Baxter’s 60 sites with the greatest use, representing 95% of the company’s total annual water consumption. Availability of renewable water supplies evaluated using the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Global Water Tool. Extreme-scarcity areas have less than 500 cubic meters of renewable water resources per person per year. Water-scarce areas have at least 500 cubic meters but less than 1,000 cubic meters. Water-stressed areas have at least 1,000 cubic meters but less than 1,700 cubic meters. Water-sufficient areas have at least 1,700 cubic meters but less than 4,000 cubic meters. Water-abundant areas have greater than 4,000 cubic meters.
19 Es timated total water pollutant levels for treated wastewater discharged directly into waterways. Data do not include two facilities that 
operate zero-discharge systems in accordance with local regulatory requirements. BOD5 refers to five-day biological oxygen demand; COD refers to chemical oxygen demand; TSS refers to total suspended solids. When actual performance data were not available, 
estimates are based on performance at similar facilities or on other measured performance indicators.
20 Fisc al year basis (October 1 through September 30 of the year noted). Data for 2015 include parts of Baxter that became Baxalta 
on July 1, 2015. 
21 United States and Puerto Rico. Fiscal year basis (October 1 through September 30 of the year noted). Accounts payable data are 
sent to a third party, which categorizes spending. Other categories include disability-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, LGBT-owned, small disadvantaged, and HUBZone-certified businesses. HUBZone is a U.S. Small Business Administration program for small companies that operate and employ people in Historically Underutilized Business Zones. Spending with suppliers that qualify for more than one category may be included in the totals for each of the relevant categories. Data for 2015 include spending from parts of Baxter that became Baxalta on July 1, 2015. Disaggregation of the data was not feasible. 
22Some subtotals vary from sum of items in category, due to rounding. 
23 V ariations in Baxter’s annual product donations are due to fluctuations in community needs, the need and volume of disaster 
relief response, the regulatory environment, manufacturing processes and changes in product mix and marketing. The company identifies opportunities to donate and responds to community and humanitarian aid partner requests as appropriate. This number may be different than the value of Baxter products distributed during the year by the company’s relief partners. See Innovation That Expands Access to Care. 
BAXTER VALUE CHAIN ENERGY USAGE AND GHG EMISSIONS 
1	Baxter used the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol to calculate emissions data from fossil fuel use. The company used country electricity emission factors published by the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) E-Grid U.S. regional electricity emission factors to calculate GHG emissions related to electricity consumption. 
2	Bureau Veritas North America, Inc. verified to a reasonable level Baxter’s 2015-2017 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. Bureau Veritas North America, Inc. also verified to a limited level Baxter’s methodology for determining 2015-2017 Scope 3 GHG emissions. 
3	Estimated based on an environmentally extended input-output model from an independent third party and Baxter’s revenue  
and sector of operation. BAXTER VALUE CHAIN ENERGY USAGE AND GHG EMISSIONS  (continued )
4	Estimated based on capital expenditures and an estimated emission factor per million dollars of capital expenditure from benchmarking with industry. 
5	Estimated based on Baxter’s actual yearly energy usage by energy type and GHG emission factors for each energy type per GaBi life cycle assessment software. 
6	Estimated by the company’s independent transportation service provider based on shipment of products to Baxter customers. 
7	Estimated emissions for wastewater treatment by municipalities and off-site waste recycling and disposal based on Baxter’s waste generation by type, guidance provided by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (United States), and the U.S. EPA WARM model. 
8	Estimated based on domestic and international air mileage, rental vehicle mileage, and hotel room stays provided by Baxter’s global travel providers, and using emission factors from UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, Greenhouse Gas Protocol Mobile Combustion GHG Emissions Calculation Tool, and Carbonfund.org Business Travel Calculator. 
9	Estimated based on the number of Baxter employees by country and statistics on commuting time and transport mode split into public transport, passenger cars, taxi and motorcycle, and walking or bicycling. Emission factors for each mode were obtained from Defra. 
10	Emissions associated with upstream leased assets are included in Baxter’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
11	Baxter used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition to determine GHG emissions associated with using biomass fuel, principally wood/wood waste, as a boiler fuel at three Baxter locations. These emissions were calculated as 129,000, 148,000, and 146,000 metric tons CO
2 in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. CO2e 
emissions from CH4 and N2O components of biomass combustion are included in reported Scope 1 emissions. 
12	Includes the purchase of electricity generated from 100% certified renewable electricity (Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States), and the purchase of carbon credits from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. 
13	Baxter used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to estimate GHG emissions associated with reported fuel usage by company-managed sales and distribution fleet vehicles and other vehicles. The company estimated fuel usage for international sales and distribution vehicles based on regional sales information. 
14	Refrigerant emissions represent reported CFC, HCFC and HFC refrigerant losses by each Baxter location. Baxter calculated associated GHG emissions using actual emission factors for each reported refrigerant. 
15	Estimated based on previous Baxter product LCAs as well as the company’s revenue by product type. Category 1 emissions were extrapolated to other categories depending on the product type. 
16	Estimated based on an environmentally extended input-output model from an independent third party and revenue from Baxter’s contract services business. 
17	Estimated based on production quantities and global warming potential information for certain types of products. Emissions for certain other products estimated based on previous Baxter product LCAs as well as the company’s revenue by product type. Category 1 emissions were extrapolated to other categories depending on the product type. 
18	Baxter engaged an independent third party to estimate 2015 GHG emissions associated with investments using an environmentally extended input-output model, Baxter’s retained shares in the spin-off of Baxalta, and Baxalta’s 2015 revenue and sector of operation. 
19	Totals do not include CO2 emissions from Baxter-owned wood-fired boilers. See footnote 11 above for detail.

• Any financial data previously audited by an external third party
• Data and information included in sections of the Report that are not listed in the scope of work above
This assurance engagement relies on a risk-based selected sample of 
data and the associated limitations that this entails. This independent statement should not be relied upon to detect all errors, omissions or misstatements that may exist.
Responsibilities
The preparation and presentation of the Selected Information in the Report are the sole responsibility of the management of Baxter. BVNA was not involved in the drafting of the Report. Our only responsibilities were to provide independent assurance on the accuracy and reliability of the Selected Information; to form an independent conclusion based on the assurance procedures performed and evidence obtained; and to report our conclusions.Assessment Standard and Reporting Criteria
We performed our work in accordance with BVNA’s standard 
procedures and guidelines for external Assurance of Sustainability 
Reports and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (effective for assurance 
reports dated on or after December 15, 2015), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.
The Reporting Criteria for this assurance were Baxter’s  
reporting requirements.
The work was planned and carried out to provide reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance of the Selected Information except for the Responsible Procurement and Logistics section of the Report, which was carried out to provide limited assurance. We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for our conclusions.
Summary of Work Performed
As part of BVNA’s assurance process, BVNA undertook the following activities:
• Assessed the appropriateness of the Reporting Criteria for the 
Selected Information
• Conducted interviews with relevant Baxter personnel responsible for collecting and reporting performance data and other subject matter for the Selected Information
• Attended a Corporate Responsibility Council Meeting for observation of management involvement and stakeholder inclusion in corporate responsibility at Baxter
• Reviewed documentary evidence produced by Baxter to support the Selected Information
• Assessed the disclosure and presentation of the Selected Information with emphasis on principles of accuracy, accessibility, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness and to ensure consistency with the Reporting Criteria
• Audited performance data during visits to operating sites located in: Atlacomulco, Mexico; Canlubang, Philippines; Cleveland, Mississippi, United States; Hechingen, Germany; Lund, Sweden; and Sabiñánigo, Spain
• Audited consolidated performance data including review of a sample of data-to-source documentation
• Reviewed Baxter data and information systems used for collection, aggregation, analysis and review of Selected Information during visits to Baxter’s offices in Round Lake, Illinois and Deerfield, Illinois, United States
Conclusions
On the basis of our methodology and the activities described above, 
it is our opinion that the Selected Information within the Product 
Innovation (except the Quality and Patient Safety subsection), 
Employee Health and Safety, Operations and Serving Our Communities 
– Baxter World Environment Week sections of the Report:
• Is accurate, reliable and free from material mistake or 
misstatement• Is presented in a clear, understandable and accessible manner
• Is presented based on the Reporting Criteria
• Provides a fair and balanced representation of activities
• Allows readers to form a balanced opinion of Baxter’s 2017 activities and performance
In addition, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the 
data and information in the Responsible Procurement and Logistics section of the Report are inaccurate or that the information is not fairly stated.
It is also our opinion that Baxter has established appropriate 
systems for the collection, aggregation, analysis and review of the Selected Information.
Additional Commentary
During the assurance process, BVNA was pleased to observe  
that Baxter has continued to improve its data collection and r
eporting processes.
Based on the work conducted, we recommend that Baxter consider 
continuing to improve the efficiency of data collection at the facility level.
