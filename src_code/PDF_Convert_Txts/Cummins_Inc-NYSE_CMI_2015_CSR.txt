PROGRESS REPORT 
2015-2016ABOUT  
THIS REPORT 
Cummins’ 2015-2016 Sustainability Progress Report is  
presented in the spirit of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).  
The GRI’s goal is to develop a consistent way for companies  
across the globe to voluntarily report on their environmental,  social and economic performance.
This report reflects Cummins’ broad view of sustainability,  
including safety, diversity and governance in addition to the company’s  
environmental initiatives, efforts to promote innovation, its community  
programs and Cummins’ financial performance.The theme of this year’s report is “POWERING WHAT’S NEXT.”  
A good part of 2015 and early 2016 at Cummins has been devoted to 
looking ahead, positioning the company so it’s ready when better markets 
return. Guided by our Vision, Mission and Values, this approach applies  
not just to Cummins’ product portfolio, but in the way the company  
engages in communities and creates the right work environment  
for success. As it has since the company’s founding in 1919,  
sustainability will continue to play a critical role in Cummins’ future.
Cummins is a global company that wants to make a difference for  
all of its stakeholders, today and in the future. This report was posted  
in May 2016 and is Cummins’ 13th annual edition.CUMMINS

2INTRODUCTIONIn our newest video, we think you’ll see that 
Cummins uses its power in many ways –  
ranging from its push for environmental 
sustainability, to its efforts to build stronger 
communities, to its ability to serve customers 
in remote locations. In the end, all of this – and 
more – defines The Power of Cummins.ABOUT  
THE COVER 
Cummins spent much of 2015-2016 focused on the future, looking  
for new ways it can power advances both in its industry and the  
world at large, hence the Sustainability Progress Report’s title 
“POWERING WHAT’S NEXT.”
The three pictures on the cover reflect the company’s focus on innovation to solve problems:
ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 
Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger spoke at the 2015 BSR Conference in San Francisco 
where he told attendees that Cummins can play an important role in helping address the  high levels of air pollution plaguing cities in developing countries. 
DRIVEN TO REDUCE CO
2 
The company in 2015 used a barnstorming tour of North America to talk about its  
2017 products, putting a special focus on the ways they can help customers improve  
fuel efficiency, which translates into a corresponding reduction in greenhouse gases.  
It’s just one of many ways Cummins is driven to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2)  
while powering our increasingly interconnected world. 
IN PURSUIT OF IMPACT 
Cummins piloted a new approach to its community service efforts in 2015  in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, focusing on a relatively small geographic area  in need of help to maximize the impact of the company’s efforts. THE POWER

Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
6INTRODUCTIONA NOTE FROM  
THE CHAIRMAN 
At Cummins, sustainability, particularly environmental sustainability, 
is critical to the company’s long-term growth and profitability.
Our economic success is driven by our ability to produce the 
cleanest, most fuel efficient engines in the world. We want to help 
our customers meet the most stringent environmental regulations 
while providing them with the dependable and affordable power  
they need to reach their business goals.If you are unfamiliar with Cummins, we 
power trucks, trains, ships, excavators and more, helping to deliver people 
and products faster, cleaner and more 
efficiently than ever before. Our engines work thousands of feet below the earth’s surface and high in the mountains in some 
of the most demanding environments in the 
world. We also make generators, providing reliable backup power to schools, hospitals and some of the largest, most technically advanced data centers on the planet.
In short, we help power the interconnected 
world that so many of us have come  to depend on, and we do it consistent  with our mission demanding “everything  
we do leads to a cleaner, healthier,  
safer environment.”
Success at Cummins is measured by  
more than the bottom line. If we do our  job right, our company can help build 
stronger communities, extend economic 
opportunity to more people and help address the environmental challenges facing the world today. 
 
  We take a holistic approach to sustainability, focusing on growth, innovation, corporate responsibility, health 
and safety, diversity and governance, in 
addition to environmental protection.  While all of these areas contribute to Cummins’ long-term success, they also 
depend, at least to some extent, on the 
company’s profitability. 
While 2015 was a profitable year for 
Cummins, it was a difficult one in many ways. International sales declined in the 
face of market challenges in much of the 
world. Revenues in North America grew  for much of 2015, but were unable to  offset weakness in many of our end 
markets elsewhere. 
In response, we made the difficult  
decision to reduce our workforce by approximately 2,000 people in the fourth quarter of 2015 and restructure several of 
the company’s operations to reduce costs, 
streamline operations and match capacity with market demand. We continued investing in new products, technology 
and strategic partnerships despite weak 
economic conditions. 
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
7INTRODUCTIONWith a leaner cost structure and 
strengthened product and market positions, I’m confident Cummins will 
emerge as a stronger company when 
our markets return to more normal levels. Cummins has emerged stronger from the last two downturns, with stronger 
profitability levels and higher growth,  
and we intend to do that again this time.
Cummins is especially well positioned  
in markets with tougher emissions standards. Unfortunately, some countries 
still believe they must choose between 
industrial development and clean air.  This view has contributed to the unacceptable levels of air pollution  
we see in many parts of the world.
We are now working with regulatory 
agencies around the world to help them develop, adopt and enforce tough but achievable emission standards. Cummins 
can offer proven technology at affordable 
prices, allowing for cleaner air and successful economic growth. 
 
 
  Enforcement, however, is critical.  As I told the 2015 BSR (formerly  Business for Social Responsibility) 
Conference in San Francisco,  
if enforcement is inconsistent,  those who comply with the rules  are the ones that lose out.
I suppose some of you might still  
be skeptical about how a company building engines and generators can  help improve the environment in polluted cities, let alone build a better world.  
I encourage you to read this report and 
learn more about the progress Cummins  is making toward improving the fuel efficiency of our products in use and 
reducing the environmental impact  
of our own operations.
I also hope you will read about the 
remarkable things our employees  are doing, working with their  
communities to preserve water  
resources, improve air quality, and promote educational opportunities. 
 
 
 
 Finally, I hope you will read about our efforts to help  
build model villages in India. 
Seeing the incredible 
improvements in economic 
achievement, education 
and health and sanitation 
in Nandal village during our 
Board of Directors’ visit in 
2014 was one of the best 
moments of my career.
One of the reasons I joined Cummins out 
of business school was I thought it offered me the best opportunity to make a positive 
difference in the world. Twenty-two years 
later, I still feel that same way.

Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
12SIX SIGMA
Cummins is a big proponent of Six Sigma, using the business 
improvement tool to save the company and its customers  billions of dollars.
Six Sigma uses data-based analysis to identify defects and 
variation in a wide range of manufacturing and business situations.  
Since it was introduced at Cummins in 2000:
 »Approximately 23,000 people at Cummins  
have been trained on Six Sigma tools over  
3 million hours.
 »Six Sigma projects have identified an estimated  $6.3 billion in savings over the tool’s 15-year 
history at Cummins.
 »Customers have saved an estimated  
$1.37 billion through Six Sigma initiatives  
with the company since the tool was first  
offered to them in 2005.
 Cummins also uses Six Sigma in its community work, helping its 
community partners address problems. Employees completed  
110 Community Impact Six Sigma projects on behalf of their community partners in 2015.
The impact of Six Sigma on the company, however,  
goes beyond cost savings and community engagement.  
It has provided Cummins with a common language and  collective mindset that can be used to address a problem  or challenge almost anywhere in the world.
In 2016, the company announced some changes to its Six Sigma 
program designed to keep projects targeted at Cummins’ most  
important business needs. The company’s top leaders will play  a key role in determining Six Sigma priorities with a special  focus on product quality, working capital, distributor synergies, 
direct material cost reductions and telematics.
After 15 years and so many people trained on the tool,  
however, it seems likely a Six Sigma mindset will continue  to be behind almost everything the company does.CUMMINS 
OPERATING SYSTEM
The Cummins Operating System 
helps develop common practices 
and approaches to improve customer 
satisfaction. The 10 practices are:
 »Put the customer first and provide  real value.
 »Synchronize flows (material, physical  and information).
 »Design quality in every step of  the process.
 »Involve people and promote team work.
 »Ensure equipment and tools are  available and capable.
 »Create functional excellence.
 »Establish the right environment.
 »Treat preferred suppliers as partners. 
 »Follow common problem- 
solving techniques.
 »Use Six Sigma as the primary  
process improvement method.CUMMINS 
BUSINESS  MODEL
The Cummins Business Model is a 
simplified view of how the Company  
is organized that starts and ends  
with customers and the business. 
The business model was updated  
in 2013 to more accurately reflect  how Cummins delivers products  and services to our customers  around the world through an  
integrated supply chain. The new  
model more clearly represents  how we work together to meet  or exceed customer expectations.OUR KEY TOOLSCummins is a company with operations across the globe.

not seem like a man on a mission.  But get him talking about Cummins’ latest fuel economy triumph, and  the corresponding decrease in  carbon dioxide (CO
2) emissions,  
and it’s easy to see why  he describes himself as a  “catalyst for fuel economy.”

In 2015, the company for the first time 
calculated the collective lifetime CO2 
emissions of its 2014 engines as part of  
its submission to the CDP , formerly known 
as the Carbon Disclosure Project.
Cummins estimated the collective 
emissions of the 1.1 million engines the 
company and its joint venture partners  sold in 2014 would be 914 million metric 
tons of CO2 over their useful lives of  
10, 20, or even 40 years. 
“Our stakeholders understand we make  
a lot of engines, and they last a long time,” 
said Brian Mormino, Executive Director  of Environmental Compliance. “But we 
have a responsibility to focus on reducing 
their lifetime emissions.”
Even before the CO
2 estimate was 
calculated, Cummins set a goal of 
partnering with customers to reach  
an annual reduction of 3.5 million  
metric tons of CO2 or 350 million  
gallons of fuel annually by 2020. 
“This isn’t about me,” Cummins  Fuel Economy Leader explains,  his eyes growing just a little bit bigger. 
“We’ve got incredibly talented people 
helping our customers all around the  world to improve the fuel efficiency of  our products in use. I’m just the guy  
who brings them together to share  
ideas that are good for our customers, good for the environment and good  for the company, too.”
O’Brien, who records, tracks and 
celebrates fuel efficiency projects for  
the company’s products in-use team, is just one of many people at Cummins focused on improving fuel efficiency,  
and by extension, reducing CO
2  
emissions. Boosting fuel economy  
results in an almost equal reduction in  
CO2, a key contributor to global warming 
and the primary greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emitted through human activities. 
Cummins is working across almost  
every function to reduce CO2, capitalizing 
on the opportunity to do something that’s good for the environment while saving 
money for customers.This effort is clearly reflected in the company’s products.  
Cummins, for example, received certification from the EPA for its  complete lineup of on-highway diesel and natural gas engines more  
than a year ahead of the second step in GHG and fuel-efficiency  
standards, which take effect in January 2017.
When the company went on a 36-city North American barnstorming  
tour in 2015 to meet with customers, Cummins’ fuel efficiency  
technology was prominently on display. 
The Redefining Tour highlighted the work of several products designed  
to improve fuel economy, including the SmartAdvantage Powertrain, which uses a combination of down-speeding and optimized  communication between the engine and transmission to boost  
fuel efficiency.
But the effort to reduce carbon dioxide goes well beyond the  
company’s products to the way Cummins works with customers,  pursues innovation and streamlines its own operations.
“Going forward, Cummins will continue to be a  
catalyst for environmental action,” says Cummins 
Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger. “Our vision  
and mission demand it, our business success  
depends on it, and the ingenuity and energy  of our employees can make it happen.”FOCUS 2015-2016
ADDRESSING OUR  
PRODUCTS IN USE
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
17The company estimates it has saved its 
customers 232 million gallons of fuel and  2.32 million metric tons of CO
2 since the 
products in-use initiative started in 2014.
One of the most active fuel economy team 
s at the company is based in Pune, India, 
where Amol Wairagade and his colleagues  are working from a list of 24 projects they  hope to accomplish over the next few years 
such as developing stop-start technology  
for their bus customers. 
“We want our customers to be the market 
leaders on fuel economy,” Wairagade said.  “We know how important fuel costs can be  
to their profitability.” 
O’Brien said Cummins has already  
worked with customers to recalibrate  engines for optimal efficiency on a wide  
range of projects, from fleets of forklifts  
to snow-making machines at ski resorts.
“If we can help customers 
reduce one of their major 
cost centers and help the 
environment at the same  
time, to me that’s huge,”  
O’Brien said.DESIGNING FOR  
THE ENVIRONMENT
The effort to reduce CO2 starts long before a Cummins  
product ever reaches a customer, however.
Cummins engineers use powerful computer models capable of simulating  
the harsh environment inside an engine to design products that are fuel efficient  
and use a minimum amount of natural resources while still delivering the power  
and durability customers need to succeed.
The models give product designers an almost limitless number of options  
before ever using a drop of fuel in a test cell.Cummins’ Kevin Brittain uses something called Numerical Optimization to help make  
these models even more effective for high horsepower engines. Numerical Optimization  is based on mathematical calculations that help designers narrow the range of possibilities 
to those that have the best chance for success.
Final designs still must be tested before they are ready for a customer. But computer 
models and tools like Numerical Optimization make it much more likely that testing  will be successful. 
“The focus of Design for Environment is to reduce our product’s environmental impact by 
making informed decisions in the design phase,” said Madeleine Fogler, who led Cummins’ 
Design for the Environment effort until changing positions in 2016. “Reducing material without compromising durability and reliability is one way to do that.”
Cummins’ Kevin Brittain  
uses Numerical Optimization  to help engineers arrive at  better designs faster.FOCUS 2015-2016

18NEW WAYS 
OF DOING BUSINESS  
Cummins has also changed  
the way it does business to 
drive down CO2.
For example, three years ago each 
of Cummins’ four business units in North America were running their own 
transportation systems, with different 
service providers.
Now, thanks in large part to a new 
computer logistics service, three of the  
four systems are part of a coordinated 
initiative with the fourth coming on line soon. The business units share trucks where it makes sense to ensure tractor-trailers are full when making runs.Supply Chain leaders can track with a laptop computer the nearly 500 trucks delivering material to company facilities  
in North America on a typical day.  
So far, Cummins has saved more  than $2 million and 2,400 metric tons  of CO
2 thanks to the new system. 
Cummins has set a goal for reducing  the CO
2 per kilogram of goods moved  
by 10 percent by 2020. The company  has seen about a 2.3 percent reduction  
so far. 
While it makes up a relatively small  
part of the company’s overall CO
2 
emissions, Cummins believes good environmental stewardship begins  
with its own operations.
 
 In addition to establishing goals,  the company has initiated a number of efforts in 2015 to reduce its carbon 
footprint, including:
 »Installing equipment to capture the 
power generated within the test cells of its high horsepower plant in Seymour, 
Indiana (U.S.A.) to help power the facility. 
The plant has significantly reduced the power it gets from its local utility and for five hours during one stretch was completely self-powered. 
 »Expanding the use of alternate fuels to help power Cummins’ facilities such as the 3.6 megawatt roof-top solar array installed at the Beijing Foton Cummins 
Engine Company Ltd. It is the largest of 
11 solar arrays at Cummins locations around the world.  » Certifying three plants in the United Kingdom, one in France and one in Belgium as the first Cummins sites 
achieving “Zero Disposal” status,  
where 100 percent of waste is  handled in a truly useful manner. The company wants to have  
30 “Zero Disposal” sites by 2020.
In all these ways and more, Cummins  
is driven to reduce CO
2, consistent  
with the company’s mission demanding that “everything we do leads to a  
cleaner, healthier, safer environment.”   FOCUS 2015-2016

19CUMMINS ACHIEVES KEY 
ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS
Cummins achieved two major environmental milestones in 
2015, exceeding its 2015 energy / greenhouse gas reduction 
goals and reaching its 2020 water goal five years early. 
“The environmental teams around the 
globe truly had an outstanding year,”  
said Mark Dhennin, Cummins’ Director  
of Energy Efficiency and Environment. 
“There was a lot of effort that went into 
delivering on our commitments, which  
our environmental professionals met  
with great skill and enthusiasm.”
Here’s a 12-month progress report  
on each of the environmental goals 
Cummins has established. 
  
 Cummins exceeded its energy and 
greenhouse gas reduction goals in 2015. The company achieved a 36 percent 
reduction in GHG intensity and a  
33 percent reduction in energy intensity  (both adjusted for sales) from the 2005 baseline year. 
In 2015, the company’s GHG emissions 
decreased by 14,000 tons on an  absolute basis and 1 percent adjusted  for sales from the prior year. 
Cummins had a number of challenges  
in maintaining progress on the goal, 
including several new buildings that  used energy but did not produce  revenue. The company also  
acquired all but one of the North  
American joint venture distributors, ENERGY  
AND  GHGS
Goal:
 »Reduce energy  
use and greenhouse  
gas (GHG) emissions  
by 25 percent and  
27 percent, respectively, 
compared to a 2005 
baseline and adjusted  
to sales, by 2015.

21GOALSincreasing Cummins’ facility footprint. 
Finally, the company invested more in research and development and the 
production of high horsepower engines, 
which substantially increased fuel usage  in test cells. 
The company used tools and resources 
available from programs such as the  
ISO 50001 (international) energy 
management system and the Department  
of Energy’s Superior Energy Performance (SEP) program to achieve the goal. In 2015, Cummins used 953 million gallons of water, a 19.6 million gallon decrease from 2014. Since the goal’s baseline year 
of 2010, direct water use is down by  
16 percent, while water use adjusted for hours worked is down by 41 percent despite an increase in the number of  
in-scope facilities during the period.
Since 2010, Cummins in-scope facilities 
increased by 200 sites to about 440 sites by the end of 2015. The increase in the footprint was due to the addition  
of new office buildings, regional  
distribution centers and acquisition  of North American distributors. 
Cummins plans on setting a new water 
goal by the end of 2016. For the global 
water goals, Cummins considers all the managed, consolidated and 50:50 joint ventures that are part of its Environmental Management System. 
In 2015, Distribution Business entities 
reduced about 43 million gallons of water by performing water balances, or evaluations, to identify and fix problems at 
little or no-cost. With several new facilities 
open that are continuing to increase production, Cummins must ensure  it continues producing results through  the next phase of growth and  
production demands. 
Cummins’ water neutrality work is 
progressing as expected. The company continues to promote awareness about  
the connection between water use in 
its plants and community needs. Over the past year, Cummins’ efforts have been focused on validating calculation methodologies using sites implementing 
projects and defining project roadmaps 
leading to goal achievement.
The company has three sites in India  
and one in China pending validation,  
and it expects three will be designated  
as water neutral during 2016. 
One notable water project won a 
Chairman’s Environmental Award in  2016. The Chongqing Cummins Engine 
Company used its water balance to  
identify leaks and implemented a  program to reduce water use by  24 percent, a savings of 42 million  
liters (11 million gallons) per year.Cummins continues to make progress  
on its waste goals. The company in  total recycled 90.4 percent of its total waste generated in 2015, equivalent  to approximately 172,000 tons of waste. 
Cummins’ European sites have already 
achieved a collective 98 percent  recycling rate. Since the baseline year of 2010, Cummins’ total waste disposed decreased by about 18 percent in absolute terms, while 
experiencing a 43 percent reduction 
in disposal adjusted for hours worked. Compared with 2014, Cummins’ total waste disposed in 2015 increased  
slightly by 858 tons on an absolute  
basis but decreased 3 percent,  adjusted for hours worked. 
The four sites that achieved Zero  
Disposal in 2014 were confirmed  
again in 2015, and one new site  
was validated in 2015, bringing the  total validated to five. Two new sites  are currently pending validation. 
Under Cummins’ definition of  
Zero Disposal, waste can only be  burned as a last resort to create  energy and then only if there is  a net energy gain, creating more  
energy than is needed merely  
to sustain combustion. WASTE
Goals:
 »Increase recycling  
rate from 89 percent  
in 2014 to 95 percent  
by 2020.
 »Reach “Zero Disposal” status at 30 sites with  
100 or more people by  
2020 where 100 percent  
of waste is reused, 
recycled or recovered  in a useful manner.

22GOALSCummins fuel economy teams  
throughout the world implemented  more than 100 fuel economy projects  
in 2015 for on- and off-road customers.  
The company is already nearly half way toward its 2020 goal, with particular success in the off-highway market where 
Cummins has more than doubled its 
original projections. As of the end of 2015, the company had achieved an annual   1.6 MMT reduction toward its goal  of a 3.5 MMT annual reduction. 
On a cumulative basis, counting work  
done in both 2014 and 2015, Cummins 
has saved customers $927 million and  232 million gallons of diesel fuel. 
There are a number of factors  
contributing to the success of the 
company’s fuel economy improvement 
efforts. The fuel savings for some large initiatives delivered results greater than originally estimated. In addition, Cummins 
exceeded its initial estimate of achieving 
between 2 and 5 percent improvement  per project for its customers, averaging instead 6.7 percent. 
Collaboration among fuel economy team 
members, from customer engineering to 
account management, has contributed greatly to new project ideas and implementation. A global fuel economy 
forum meets monthly to share projects  
and best practices to fuel ideas for additional work.
 
 Some of the successes include a partnership between engineers at Cummins’ Darlington Engine Plant in the 
U.K. and their counterparts at the Hyster-
Yale Group, a leading manufacturer  of materials handling equipment. Working together on nearly 20 projects since 2010, 
the partnership has delivered annual fuel 
savings in excess of 2 million gallons. 
In another example, Cummins U.K. on-
highway customer engineering worked with U.K. bus OEMs (original equipment 
manufacturers) to improve the fuel 
efficiency of Euro VI certified Cummins ISB engines in transit buses. Fuel economy improvements ranged from 2 to 5 percent, 
which was in addition to the nearly  
20 percent improvement of the Euro VI engine compared to the Euro V engine.
In 2015, the partnership was able to 
avoid 2,800 metric tons of CO
2, saving 
customers 280,000 gallons of diesel fuel or $1.3 million. Consequently, Cummins-
powered buses can now qualify for the 
London Low Carbon Certification tax incentive program. Cummins has achieved a 2.8 percent reduction through 2015 on CO
2 per 
kilogram of goods moved against  its goal of a 10 percent reduction.
Logistics teams worked on several 
initiatives that helped Cummins’ transportation network become more efficient in 2015. The company has  
created strategic transportation 
partnerships, moving from more than  40 carriers to a core group of five that  now moves 85 percent of Cummins’ freight. These carriers are encouraged  
to use natural gas, a low emission fuel. The company has moved to multiple 
consolidation centers across the globe to more effectively handle international 
shipments. Routing changes are also 
allowing Cummins to move goods  more efficiently.
The company has increased the  
amount of goods moved in its  
trucks, resulting in a greater  weight per truck than ever  before. More intermodal freight  options are considered and  
the company is moving to  
rail from truck transportation  where feasible.LOGISTICS

25GOALSVISION FOR  
NEW PRODUCT 
DESIGN
As the largest independent diesel engine manufacturer  
in the world, Cummins has the means and the  
commitment to reduce both the resources it uses to  
build products and the fuel burned to operate them.
For the past 20 years, the company has focused its technology development  
on meeting regulatory requirements for the reduction of oxides of nitrogen (NOx),  
particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO). But as those regulations  
near zero in developed markets, Cummins’ focus for the next decades will  
be increasingly on fuel efficiency and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction. 
“Our product vision conveys that we are committed to pushing technology  
boundaries to solve environmental problems for our customers and our  
communities,” said Vice President – Chief Technical Officer Jennifer Rumsey.
Engineering teams have long included fuel efficiency targets as part of their product 
development process. Today, Cummins is conducting a great amount of research into  
what it would take to expand its approach to design efficient products that are needed 
far into the future – to 2030 and beyond. The company is moving beyond just meeting 
regulations as its main guidepost and driving force to focusing on continuing to exceed 
customer’s expectations while reducing the environmental impact of its products. As a result, Cummins has created a vision 
statement for new product design:This vision statement reflects Cummins’ commitment to differentiated products  
for the future and the necessary changes 
to deliver them. The company knows it  will require an in-depth knowledge of product markets and applications, challenging Cummins’ product planning 
and technical function to transform how  
the company thinks about future technologies and products that delight  our customers and match long-term  
global environmental scenarios.
Cummins’ vision of being first  
to market, driving customer success  and going faster and further builds on efforts already underway. The company  
has certified a complete lineup of  
on-highway diesel and natural gas  engines to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, compliant to  
both the current EPA regulations and  
the second level of Phase 1 GHG and  fuel-efficiency standards, which take  effect in January 2017. 
Cummins certified the Dodge Ram  
ISB engine three years early to the  
2010 stringent NOx standards and  was the first to certify to the California   Air Resources Board’s stringent  optional NOx standard of  
0.02 gm/hp-hr with the ISLG engine. 
Cummins is growing its suite of data 
connectivity software applications to help customers increase asset operating efficiency and utilization. Connected 
Diagnostics gathers engine data to 
provide customers with immediate expert recommendations in response to engine fault information, which results in greater 
productivity and maximized uptime. 
Later this year, Connected Calibrations  
and Connected Tuning will be introduced as additional tools for optimizing the operating efficiency of the company’s

ACCELERATING 
CO2 REDUCTIONS
Cummins expanded the disclosure  
of its greenhouse gas footprint in 2015  
to include the lifetime carbon dioxide 
(CO2) emissions of the company’s 
products sold in 2014.
Cummins has reported its facility 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to CDP , 
formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure 
Project, for 10 years. In 2015, for the first 
time, the company reported to CDP its 
estimate that the collective CO2 emissions 
of the just over 1 million engines Cummins 
and its joint venture partners sold in 2014 
would be 914 million metric tons over their 
useful lives of 10, 20 or even 40 years. These engines play a critical role, powering 
trucks, trains, ships and more, delivering 
needed goods, food and medicine around 
the world. They power school buses, 
emergency vehicles like fire engines, 
off-highway vehicles such as tractors 
critical to food production and excavators 
essential to building roads and bridges. 
Finally, they power the generators essential 
to schools, hospitals and data centers.

Cummins Redefining 
Efficiency Tour takes  
off from Columbus, 
Indiana in 2015.

America highlighted  
many of the ways the 
company’s products  
are improving  
fuel efficiency.

27The new estimate is more  
evidence that Cummins’  
biggest opportunity to reduce  
its CO2 footprint is with its  
products, both in their design  
and in use, through greater fuel  
efficiency. It gives the company  
a baseline to measure against  
as it moves forward in its  
CO2 reduction efforts.
Here are four things to know  
about Cummins’ commitment  
to improving fuel efficiency  
and reducing CO2 : 
 
 
 Reducing CO2  
emissions is a win  for the environment 
and for our customers, too.
Redefining efficiency and 
accelerating CO2 reductions 
are key parts of Cummins’ environmental sustainability 
strategy. One of the company’s 
goals is to partner with customers to improve the fuel efficiency  of Cummins products in use,  
and by extension reduce CO
2.  
The company wants to cut CO2 
emissions by nearly 16 million 
metric tons, saving customers up 
to $6.3 billion through greater fuel 
efficiency, by the end of 2020. Cummins and its 
customers care  
about reducing  
lifetime emissions.
Customers say fuel efficiency  
is one of the top attributes they look for when making a purchase. 
They want to deliver the goods 
they transport as cleanly and efficiently as possible. The same goes for schools, transit systems 
and fire departments. 
Over the next five years, 
Cummins expects to work with 20 percent of its customer base, touching nearly 2 million engines 
as it tailors engine specifications 
to customer applications.  The company wants to ensure customers have the latest tools  
to improve fuel efficiency.We will use our  
technical leadership  
to innovate.
Cummins has the technical 
leadership to reduce CO2 not 
just in its work with customers but in product design and 
manufacturing. Cummins 
introduced more electronic  engine features to improve fuel economy in 2015 and wrapped 
up work on the SuperTruck,  
the super-efficient concept  truck of the future. We partner  
with others for a  
cleaner environment.
There is growing public demand 
for environmental regulations of all kinds by governments 
in almost every country. 
Customers increasingly want the environmental attributes Cummins products provide to meet new 
regulations, with the power and 
reliability the company is known  for to help them compete and win. 
By actively participating in the 
rule-making process, Cummins 
is positioned to excel in regulated 
environments, providing real value to its customers. The company is also engaged in many other 
collaborations and partnerships, 
working with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as the Environmental Defense Fund  and leading universities and 
research labs.Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1GOALS

28PRODUCT 
STEWARDSHIP
Product stewardship at Cummins’ means the company’s  
mission demanding “everything we do leads to a cleaner,  
healthier, safer environment” is foremost on the minds  
of employees when they think about the lifecycle  
of the company’s products. 
Cummins adopted its first-ever comprehensive environmental sustainability plan in  
2014, building on the good work the company had already done to reduce its 
environmental impact. The plan examined Cummins’ entire environmental footprint, 
focusing on the key areas of water, waste, energy and greenhouse gases (GHGs).
It was clear from this analysis that the company’s top priority must be its  
products, both in design and in use. This analysis led Cummins to establish its  
products in-use goal in 2015 and its new product design vision statement in 2016.
As the concept of environmental sustainability matured at the company, views  
broadened and leaders initiated “Envolve Cummins,” a comprehensive way to view and 
prioritize actions to address the company’s biggest environmental opportunities. These 
actions ranged from the materials the company buys to the emissions of its products.

Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
29REDUCING 
CUMMINS CARBON FOOTPRINT
Cummins is working in multiple ways  
to reduce the carbon footprint of its products and operations:
CARBON REDUCTIONS
Cummins’ operations met the company’s 
second energy and GHG reduction goal  
in 2015 and is making progress on its 
logistics goal announced that same year.While only 1 percent of the company’s estimated GHG footprint comes from Cummins’ own operations, it offers  
a great opportunity for employee 
engagement and cost savings and  remains an important priority at Cummins. 
PRODUCT DESIGN AND USE
Seventy percent of a product’s 
environmental footprint is determined during the earliest phases of the design process, according to the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
Cummins engineers are now thinking about  
ways to make the company’s products even more environmentally-friendly in the 
future, captured in the company’s new 
product design vision statement. 
Cummins is beginning to integrate tools 
and training programs into its new product development process to take into account 
the environmental impacts of all phases of 
product life-cycle, including raw material extraction, manufacturing, product use  and end of life. GHG emissions from Cummins  products in use are the company’s  largest environmental impact and  
represent an estimated 99 percent of 
Cummins’ greenhouse gas footprint due  to fossil fuel use, which emits carbon dioxide (CO
2), a key contributor to climate 
change. Cummins’ biggest opportunity  to expand its product stewardship  
beyond the upfront design is in working 
with customers to improve the efficiency  of its products in use. 
This is a win-win as it saves customers  
on fuel use and reduces GHGs.  
Through Cummins’ products in-use  goal, the company can make an  immediate difference. 
Based on previous Cummins fuel efficiency 
projects, the company expects that a  
3 to 5 percent reduction in fuel usage can be achieved for many customers through optimization tools, system-level expertise 
and various fuel economy engine features. REMANUFACTURING
Cummins’ remanufacturing is the 
company’s oldest “green business.” It requires far less energy and natural 
resources to remanufacture products to 
extend life than to build new products. 
Remanufacturing maximizes benefits  
for customers and the environment. Cummins products are designed with  
this in mind, enabling them to have  
a long, and increasingly fuel efficient, life. 
Through the common application of 
salvage technology, component re-use 
guidelines and remanufacturing-specific 
policies and procedures, the company  has become increasingly sophisticated  in what it can remanufacture and for  how long it can extend a product’s life. 
In many cases, remanufactured  
products today are “upcycled”  to include design, emissions, fuel  economy and quality upgrades. 
Lighter, more compact, engine designs 
combined with new materials (compact graphite and aluminum) and special coatings are changing Cummins’ approach to remanufacturing and making engines

30more fuel efficient. Cummins is working 
on “design for disassembly,” to make remanufacturing easier. The company  
is also developing specific rebuild kits to 
improve fuel economy at time of rebuild.
USING FEWER 
RESOURCES
Use less, use better and use again are the 
strategic ideas guiding Cummins to using fewer natural resources. This goes beyond 
the company’s facilities, although certainly 
conservation is important there and Cummins has goals driving action. This new way of thinking at Cummins encompasses the entire product lifecycle, incorporating design tools, advanced 
manufacturing concepts and material 
science for the efficient use of materials and fuels and increased opportunities  for remanufacturing and reuse.  The sustainability world calls it circular 
material flow – Cummins calls it good for 
business and good responsible citizenship.
Packaging leaders at Cummins continue 
to focus on reusable and returnable 
packaging to minimize natural resource  
use and reduce material sent to landfills. 
SOLVING 
COMPLEX PROBLEMS
A growing world population will bring 
environmental challenges that Cummins must partner with others to help solve. 
By 2030, the world will use 30 percent 
more energy and require 50 percent  more food (using more natural resources  to grow it). There is a projected  
40 percent water gap. The company continues to encourage 
suppliers to become more energy  efficient and to source responsibly. 
Cummins is working with communities  
in water-stressed areas where it has  operations to replenish water used at company facilities for community use. 
Cummins has long worked with 
government and non-governmental organizations as well as technology collaborations on a host of  environmental issues. It also has a 
demonstrated strength for effectively 
engaging in public policy to further environmental protection.
The company has a long history of 
supporting regulatory actions that are 
tough, clear and enforceable going back  to the 1970s and the Clean Air Act.
The company supports a separate  
engine standard in these regulations to 
provide a clear direction for innovation, 
addressing the component that  burns all the fuel and emits the CO
2.  
It ensures enforceable requirements. 
A regulatory framework that includes 
a combination of engine and vehicle 
standards is also the most cost-effective

MATERIAL 
COMPLIANCE
Material compliance is key to Cummins' 
product stewardship. The company maintains a corporate policy regarding the 
use of prohibited and restricted substances 
in its products. Cummins’ policies take into account key global environmental regulations as well as very specific ones 
driven by the European Union such as 
Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH); Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), and End of Life Vehicle for 
automotive products. 
REACH addresses the production and use 
of chemical substances and their potential impacts on both human health and the 
environment, while RoHS restricts the  
use of certain hazardous substances  in electrical and electronic products. Compliance with the company’s policies is designed into the materials Cummins 
uses and the company partners with 
its suppliers to ensure Cummins’ global compliance requirements are met.
The company maintains global policies  
to carry out key processes such as the  
Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry 
process, consistent with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) due diligence framework. 
Cummins is working with the Association 
of Equipment Manufacturers on a standardized approach for data collection and supplier training to ensure all products delivered in the market are compliant with 
global regulations. Supply chain teams 
have developed web-based training for suppliers to learn how to collect compliance data at upstream tiers in 
the supply chain. A template that meets 
industry standards to compliant data exchange is available at no cost to the company’s supply chain.
Cummins’ efforts resulted in a process 
both compliant to Section 1502 of the 
Dodd Frank Act in the United States   on conflict minerals, and one that sets the expectation of responsible sourcing practices throughout the company’s  
supply base. Conflict minerals are mined  
in conditions of armed conflict and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjacent countries.
Publicly traded companies on U.S. 
exchanges must disclose whether they use specified materials from those countries such as tungsten, tantalum and gold in their products. The company also releases 
a position statement on restricted and 
prohibited materials and conflict minerals.
An annual assessment by Tulane University 
evaluates companies’ compliance to the  
requirement of Section 1502, including 
transparency of disclosure and a comparison of best practices amongst industry peers. Cummins ranks in  the top 11 percent of filers.
A specialized disclosure report is available 
at cummins.com. Cummins strives to ensure that minerals in its products  come from conflict-free sources.PRODUCT SAFETY
Cummins’ Mission demands that everything the company does leads  to a “cleaner, healthier, safer environment.” That makes product safety  a top priority. Cummins Product Safety Policy says:
 »Cummins will design, manufacture, sell, distribute and service all products  so that they are safe to use for the described and intended purpose.
 »Cummins will provide its customers, its partners, the company’s  employees and society with products that are safe to operate, maintain,  
adjust and repair when used as intended.
 »Each Cummins employee will regard product safety as a top priority.
 »Each Cummins employee is responsible for applying the policy in  
his or her individual and collective work activity.
 »Each Cummins employee is expected to adhere to the spirit as well  
as the letter of the Product Safety Policy.
Cummins has a set of standardized corporate and local policies and  
procedures in order to meet the Corporate Product Safety Policy.  Each Cummins business unit has a Product Safety Committee that  
is accountable for applying the policies and procedures in its area. 
These Product Safety Committees integrate into the Corporate Product  
Safety Council, which is managed by the corporate Director of Product  Safety. This network allows for collaboration and rapid communication  on safety-related matters. 
In compliance with the company’s Product Safety Policy in 2015, Cummins  
voluntarily initiated eight product safety campaigns, impacting approximately  38,000 Cummins engines and/or Cummins components. These campaigns  were reported to the relevant public agencies as required by applicable laws  
and improvements were made on each of the Cummins products at issue. GOALS

33 ENGINE  
BUSINESS
Cummins Engine Business produces engines for on- and  
off-highway use, ranging from engines for pickup trucks,  
school buses and large tractor-trailers hauling freight to  
engines for construction, agriculture and industrial uses.
Pollutants in engine emissions have declined significantly in North America  
since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began regulating them  
in the 1970s. On-highway diesel engine emissions, for example, are down  
more than 95 percent for particulate matter (PM) and oxides of  
nitrogen (NOx), reaching near-zero emission levels.
Advances in fuel economy, meanwhile, have greatly reduced the output of  
carbon dioxide (CO2) and by extension, greenhouse gases (GHGs).  
CO2 is a key contributor to climate change.
Cummins has been a pioneer in clean diesel technology, advances in combustion, 
electronic controls, fuel systems, filtration, air handling, exhaust aftertreatment and  
more to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy. The company has achieved  
these advances working on its own and in partnership with others.
In addition to diesel, the company has also been a leader in the development of engines 
that run on biodiesel, natural gas and other alternative fuels to provide customers with  
the option that best works for them to meet their own sustainability goals.LIVING CUMMINS’  
MISSION IN OUR  PRODUCTS
Cummins introduced more than  
70 products or product updates in 2015, many addressing emissions, fuel efficiency or both as the company pursued its mission that “everything  we do leads to a cleaner, healthier,  safer environment.”
While its work is often complex, Cummins’ goal is simple: provide customers  
with the power, quality and reliability they need to succeed while meeting  the regulations applicable to any particular market.
The company believes it has a distinct advantage when it comes to designing  
and building clean, fuel-efficient engines, generators and related components  that deliver real economic value to its customers.
Cummins is the only independent engine manufacturer with the in-house capability  
to produce all of the critical subsystems required to build an engine or generator. Here’s a look at some of the major sustainability 
developments in Cummins’ products in 2015-2016, 
organized by business segment.
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
34PRODUCTSHere are some of the most significant environmental sustainability  
developments in the Engine Business in 2015 and early 2016:
QSK19
Cummins announced in November 
2015 that its QSK19 engines will power two of the new models in John Deere’s 
8000 Series Self-Propelled Forage 
Harvesters lineup – the 8700 at 755 hp (563 kW) and the 8800 at 832 hp (620 kW). The machines offer forage 
producers more productivity, increased 
uptime and are designed with the latest forage-harvesting technology.
NOTABLE:
These models also provide forage 
producers with a more efficient  cost of operation with improved  fuel efficiency – up to 6 percent  
(gallons per ton) in corn and up  
to 15 percent (gallons per ton)  in grass. When packaged alongside  the stronger design and higher- horsepower performance of the  
QSK19, these machines will  
provide years of reliable service.GHG CERTIFICATION
Cummins announced in January 2016 that it received certification for its  complete lineup of on-highway diesel and natural gas engines from the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The lineup met both the  
current EPA regulations and the second step in greenhouse gas and  
fuel-efficiency standards, which take effect in 2017.
NOTABLE:
Fuel efficiency is improved across the commercial vehicle lineup from  
5.0 liters to 15 liters. Throughout 2014 and 2015, Cummins implemented  efficiency enhancements that enable its engines to meet EPA 2016 and  GHG 2017 requirements. On-board diagnostic requirements were met  with enhanced monitors, ensuring that exhaust tailpipe emissions  
stay within EPA limits. 
Efficiency improvements implemented in the 2016 ISX15 400 hp-to- 
475 hp ratings will provide customers with fuel economy gains over  the 2013 ISX15, ranging from 2.5 percent on the base engine up  
to 7.5 percent for engines with the SmartAdvantage and  
ADEPT powertrain features.SMARTADVANTAGE
Power management company Eaton announced with Cummins in November  2015 an expanded lineup of the integrated ISX15 SmartAdvantage powertrains  to provide customers with additional choices tailored to their unique needs.
NOTABLE:
The new SmartAdvantage direct drive ratio is available in Cummins ISX15 400 hp and  
450 hp ratings with 1550/1750 ft.-lbs. torque-rating, ensuring optimal performance at  
lower rpm when combined with a 2.26 or 2.28 axle ratio. This package is the ideal  
solution for line haul or regional haul applications that operate in flat and hilly road  terrains at cruise speeds in the 50 to 62 mph range.
The new SmartAdvantage Powertrain options continue to leverage the diesel engine’s 
torque and efficiency with technology that enables downspeeding. Downspeeding refers  
to engine operation at a lower rpm while cruising at a certain speed for fuel savings.  
    SmartAdvantage makes it easier for drivers to  
     operate within a larger “sweet spot”  
      to experience fuel efficiency. 
 
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
35PRODUCTSSMARTEFFICIENCY
Cummins announced a product 
improvement plan called SmartEfficiency for global bus 
customers in February 2016 that 
focuses on improved fuel efficiency, lower total cost of ownership and improved uptime.
NOTABLE:
The SmartEfficiency initiative includes 
optimized calibrations, product tailoring with improved power and torque, mild-
hybrid technologies, integrated powertrains 
and an expanded lineup of alternative energy products. The initiative aligns with the industry focus on reducing GHG and 
CO
2 emissions. 
 
 
 CONNECTED 
DIAGNOSTICS MOBILE APP
Cummins in February 2016 released 
its Connected Diagnostics mobile app, which provides guidance and 
actionable information delivered 
directly to a customer’s mobile phone.
NOTABLE: 
The app complements Cummins’ popular 
fault monitoring application by providing 
features such as a status page listing the customer’s connected equipment and is organized by the engine system’s fault code status.
Connected Diagnostics is a customer’s 
lifeline to Cummins. Through a telematics connection, a customer’s Cummins-powered equipment wirelessly connects 
the engine to Cummins for immediate 
diagnosis of an engine system fault, providing the customer valuable information within seconds.ISX15
Cummins in February 2016 released  three new ISX15 ratings ideal for  premium fleets or performance- 
oriented line-haul applications.  
The new 475-, 450- and  400-horsepower ratings with  1850 lb-ft of torque provide an  
optimal blend of performance  
and fuel efficiency for high-load  applications or fleets that encounter mountainous terrain.
NOTABLE:
Customers who traditionally opted  
for a 485 hp or 500 hp rating can  now benefit from the superior  
fuel economy of operating at  
a lower rpm while satisfying  performance expectations.
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
36PRODUCTSB6.7, L9
Cummins in March 2016 unveiled  
the next generation of its B6.7  and L9 midrange engines with  
features designed to increase 
efficiency and performance.
NOTABLE:
The entire range of B6.7 ratings include  
an increase in fuel economy of 5 to 7 percent depending on their rating compared to their predecessors without sacrificing power. The engine, which is 
frequently used in emergency vehicles  
and school buses, is also capable of adding stop-start technology, which  allows it to operate only when necessary  
to save fuel and create a quieter ride.
The L9, used to power vehicles such  
as transit buses, is designed for the  most demanding work truck  applications. New for 2017 is a  
350 hp/1150 lb-ft rating that  
maintains more power and  torque over a wider rpm range.DELIVERING  
ON OUR  
MISSION
After driving most of the  
approximately 76,000 miles covered  
during Cummins Redefining Tour,  
Mike Carlson said he’ll never think about 
fuel economy in quite the same way.
Hauling just over 60,000 pounds as part  
of the 36-city tour across North America  
to demonstrate some of the company’s 
latest technology, Carlson said he 
frequently got better than 9 miles per gallon 
in the tractor-trailer he drove for most of the 
tour while averaging better than 8 miles-
per-gallon over the entire trip.Trucks on the road today generally get closer to 6 or 7 miles-per-gallon depending on their age, make and model.
“If you had told me I’d be getting 8.3 or 
8.4 miles per gallon when we started 
this trip, I’d say that’s impossible,” the professional driver with Mobile Events said in the parking lot of Lucas Oil Stadium in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana (U.S.A.), 
where the tour ended Oct. 6, 2015. 
The Cummins Redefining Tour, which 
started in June, featured five Class-8 truck-and-trailer combinations representing 
major original equipment manufacturer 
(OEM) brands. The trucks were powered by a combination of Cummins’ current ISX15 engine, the Cummins-Eaton SmartAdvantage Powertrain and  the 2017 ISX15 engine with the  compact and highly efficient Single  
Module aftertreatment system.
Fuel economy was only part of the 
message delivered during the tour – efficiency, performance, reliability and 
customer support were other key themes. 
But the tour came as Cummins is exploring ways it can reduce the greenhouse gases (GHGs) produced by its products in use. Improving fuel economy translates directly 
into GHG reductions.
Several of the technologies featured had 
fuel-saving components, including ADEPT (Advanced Dynamically Efficient Powertrain 
Technology), which adjusts speed, power and gear selection to take advantage of 
vehicle momentum and operate the engine sporadically at idle, maximizing efficiency. 
The Redefining Tour served much  
the same purpose as founder Clessie Cummins’ cross-country forays to demonstrate the attributes of the  
diesel engine. While not a scientific  
test, the 2015 tour enabled the  company to demonstrate to its  customers how Cummins is  meeting its mission that  
everything the company does  
“leads to a cleaner, healthier,  safer environment.”

B6.7 AND L9
Cummins revealed in April 2016 a new generation of ultra-low emissions engines, 
spanning from 100 hp to 430 hp, that are designed to meet stringent 2019 European Union Stage V emissions regulations for construction, mining  
and material-handling equipment.
NOTABLE:
The engines use the Single Module aftertreatment,  
but do not include Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR),  
allowing for a simpler architecture that results in more  power and torque. The engines were unveiled at bauma,  the world’s largest trade fair in the construction industry  held every three years in Munich, Germany.NATURAL  
GAS ENGINES
Cummins has developed a full line of natural gas engines both 
through its Engine Business and through Cummins Westport 
Inc. The joint venture partnership was established with Westport 
Innovations Inc. of Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada), in 2001.
ISB6.7 G
In July 2015, Cummins Westport introduced the 2016 ISB6.7 G,  
a 6.7-liter midrange, natural gas engine.
NOTABLE:
The ISB6.7 G natural gas engine is based on the Cummins ISB6.7 diesel engine  
platform – the industry leader in the Cummins midrange engine family and the  top-selling engine in the school bus market. The ISB6.7 G can be fueled by  
compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG) or renewable  
natural gas (RNG). The engine will be certified at launch to meet EPA  and California Air Resources Board (CARB) emissions standards.

speeds of up to 125 miles per hour while 
meeting the Environmental Protection 
Agency’s (EPA) stringent Tier 4 emission standards using the QSK95, the largest high-speed diesel engine Cummins has 
ever built.
The QSK95 was the first single  
prime power engine to receive Tier4 Locomotive certification from the EPA.  Tier 4 requires manufacturers to reduce 
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate 
matter (PM) emissions by more than  70 percent compared with Tier 3 regulations, which took effect in 2011.The 8-foot high, 14-foot long engine is manufactured in the United States at Cummins’ engine plant in Seymour, 
Indiana. It features the best fuel efficiency, 
cleanest emissions and lowest total cost  of ownership of any locomotive engine in its class.
The 4,400 hp QSK95 was featured in a 
story about Cummins’ growing presence  in the passenger rail business in the  2014-2015 Sustainability Progress Report.
“This is a very exciting and important  
time for passenger rail in North America,” 
said Melina Kennedy, General Manager –  Global Rail and Defense Business. “Cummins is pleased to partner with 
Siemens to bring innovative and 
dependable new technologies to market.”

40PRODUCTS5.5 KW  
GENERATOR SET
Cummins Onan introduced a compact new 5.5 kW generator set in  
March 2015 designed to run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and  provide auxiliary electric and optional hydraulic power for the growing  
number of commercial truck fleets powered by CNG.
NOTABLE: 
Compared to gasoline, CNG offers a reduced carbon footprint and lower per-gallon 
equivalent cost of operation. This makes CNG ideal for the small service trucks used  
by telecommunications companies, utilities, food trucks and other commercial  operations concerned with fuel economy and sustainable business practices. 
Recognized as the quietest and lowest vibration generator set in its class, the new  
unit has an enclosed muffler and exhaust catalysts that help it meet all applicable 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB)  
air quality standards. It also features self-diagnosis capability to simplify  troubleshooting, and digital voltage regulation for voltage and frequency stability. 
POWER  
SYSTEMS 
Cummins Power Systems is committed to developing  
products that minimize their impact on the environment.  
The business unit is developing cleaner combustion  
techniques with natural gas and diesel reciprocating  engine generators, plus factory-integrated exhaust  
aftertreatment that allows these products to meet  
stringent global emissions standards.
The business has been in the forefront of the move to cleaner,  
quieter and more efficient diesel engine-powered generator sets,  improving the fuel efficiency of all its engines because less fuel  
consumed means fewer emissions overall. Cummins Power  
Systems’ lean-burn gas engine generators used in combined  heat and power applications significantly reduce wasted  energy and overall emissions.
Here are some of the most significant  
environmental sustainability developments  
in the business in 2015 and early 2016:NATURAL GAS  
GENERATOR  SETS 
In October 2015, Cummins  
Power System announced it was partnering with the U.K. Power  
Reserve (UKPR), the United  
Kingdom’s largest independent developer and operator of peaking power, to bring an extra 348 MW to  
the U.K.’s under-pressure national grid. 
NOTABLE: 
Cummins will deploy more than  
150 lean-burn natural gas generator sets 
in nearly 20 new medium-sized plants.  
Key reasons why UKPR chose to partner with Cummins included support from global resources, customer service, 
leading-edge technologies and a  
strong supply chain.

41PRODUCTS55-KW MARINE
Cummins in February 2016 released a 
new Onan marine EPA Tier 3-certified generator, the 55-kW MDDCM. 
The generator provides customers 
a higher power option in a more environmentally-friendly product  than previously available from Onan.
NOTABLE:
The 55-kW Onan marine generator was 
engineered for lower emissions and some of the best sound and vibration mitigation 
in the industry while still delivering the 
reliability and durability that marine operators have come to expect from Cummins. All Onan marine generators  
feature advanced sound shields  
for lower sound and an optimized  mounting system for reduced vibration.
20, 40 AND 60 KVA  
GENERATOR SETS
Cummins in September of 2015 showed off its new compact, transport-optimized 
20, 40 and 60 kVA generator sets as part of its European rental product range.
NOTABLE:
Cummins Power Systems targeted these new generator sets for the specific needs of 
rental fleet operators with customers in demanding sectors including construction, events, telecom and manufacturing. The new generator sets comply with the latest EU Stage IIIA emissions standards. Robust construction and heavy-duty components minimize total cost 
of ownership and the overall result is rental units that deliver optimum reliability in the field, 
with excellent uptime and service intervals of up to 500 hours.

A WHOLE LOT 
OF SHAKING GOING ON
Testing any generator to  
see if it will stand up to an  earthquake is never easy but  if that generator is 12.5 feet  high, 28.5 feet long and  weighs some 80,000 pounds,  it’s especially challenging.
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
43PRODUCTSNo wonder Cummins Power Systems 
employees were pleased to learn late in 2015 that after months of planning,  
logistics and testing, the QSK95 generator set had passed the “shaker table test” for seismic certification. That certification included the International Building Code and 
the California (U.S.A.) Office of Statewide  
Health Planning and Development (OSHPD).
Seismic testing and certification are 
required in some states in the U.S. and  in some applications such as nuclear  
plants, but they are also becoming more 
popular for mission critical equipment  used in data centers and hospitals.
The QSK95 generator produces 3.5 MW 
(megawatt) of power, enough to deliver 
reliable, mission critical power protection without interruption to data centers, hospitals, water treatment plants and more.The actual shaker test took place on  
a specially designed, three-axis shaker  
table about four feet off the ground in  
March 2015 at the U.S. Army Corps  
of Engineers’ Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) in  
Champaign, Illinois (U.S.A.). 
Cummins had personnel at the site  
from March 2 to March 27, 2015,  with the majority of setup taking place  in the first week and the actual testing  in the remaining three weeks, said  
Charles Knealing, Product Design  
Engineer – Group Leader at  Cummins Power Systems.
Planning the test, however, began  
months earlier and included a long list of 
activities such as designing and fabricating specially for the test an exhaust hood capable of removing 25,000 cubic  feet per minute of air at 900 degrees  
Fahrenheit from the test cell.
Testing and teardown alone took one 
month and five full semi-loads of parts,  test equipment and tools, not to mention  
a QSK95 generator trucked in from 
Cummins Power Systems’ headquarters  in Fridley, Minnesota (U.S.A.).
Preparing for the seismic  
testing of the QSK95 generator 
took months of planning.

DESIGNED TO REDUCE 
CARBON FOOTPRINT
Cummins is constantly working to shrink  
the company’s environmental footprint with a  
special focus on the waste, water, and energy  
Cummins uses in the production process.Here’s a look at some of the company’s 
key practices and strategies in this important area:
WATER  
STRATEGY
Cummins’ water strategy includes 
four priority areas: conservation, risk management in business operations, 
community engagement and supply chain.
The company recognizes water as an 
operational risk, especially in parts of  the world where water is scarce. Cummins’ strategy includes working 
with community leaders in water scarce 
locations to help them establish their  own conservation initiatives. 
Cummins’ strategy also identifies the 
critical role water plays in the company’s 
supply chain. Almost 90 percent of 
Cummins’ water footprint exists in the supply chain, mostly associated with the extraction and production of metals. 
The company is beginning to work with 
suppliers to help them develop less water intensive techniques.
As part of its strategy, Cummins has 
developed tools to help the company 
calculate the true cost of water and  
target its actions to ensure the effective  use of resources. 
Cummins’ risk mitigation tool takes into 
account costs such as pumping, heating 
and chemical usage in water, which are often not considered when evaluating a project. In addition, the company’s risk assessment tool assesses water 
conservation and efficiency at a site as  
well as risk exposure and other factors.

WATER  
RISKS
These are the five most water-stressed  
river basins in the regions where Cummins 
has operations. Each of these locations  
also falls within the company’s priority 
regions for achieving water neutrality. 
Overall, 45 percent of Cummins water  
use is from water stressed areas.
The size of the dot represents the size  
of the water basin in a particular region. The percentages refer to the amount of water removed relative to Cummins’ total water use. 
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
47PRACTICESWASTE  
STRATEGY
The company uses a waste hierarchy 
that is consistent with current industry standards: avoid the generation of  
waste, reuse, recycle, and waste to  
energy as a last resort. 
Reducing packaging is one way Cummins 
tries to avoid the generation of waste. 
Reusing waste might involve reusing pallets  
or finding an alternative use without  
any reprocessing. Recovery and reuse of solvents is another example. The recycling  
of metals, paper or wood also reduce the 
amount of waste that has to be disposed. 
The company’s ultimate goal is “Zero 
Disposal” at Cummins facilities. Cummins is also committed to avoiding the production 
of hazardous waste and properly handling 
hazardous materials in the workplace. 
The definition for what constitutes 
hazardous waste varies widely by country. Cummins follows all appropriate local and 
regional regulations. For U.S. sites that 
produce hazardous waste, Cummins has a formal pre-qualification vendor process to ensure the waste is handled properly.ENERGY 
STRATEGY
Saving energy has both environmental 
and bottom-line benefits. The company estimates savings of $40 million per year 
from its energy efficiency efforts. Cummins 
strategy focuses on four key areas:
 »Saving and conserving energy  by improving existing facilities.
 »Recovering test cell energy.
 »Building energy conservation  into new construction.
 »Enhancing energy management.
High efficiency “smart” lighting and energy 
efficient windows, doors, walls and 
roofs reduce heat gain or loss. Heating, cooling and recirculation systems offer opportunities for efficiency as do boilers 
and burners.
Cummins has been working to  
recover energy generated by engines and generators in its test cells by installing equipment that can capture that power for 
use by the plant or for sale to a local utility. The company has eleven solar  
installations, the two most significant  being the 3.6 megawatt installation  
at Beijing Foton Cummins Engine 
Company Ltd. in China and the  2 megawatt installation in  Jamestown, New York. (U.S.A.).
Cummins is a partner in the U.S. 
Department of Energy’s Better Buildings Challenge. The company surpassed  its 25 percent reduction in U.S. energy efficiency intensity commitment by  
the end of 2015 by achieving an  
33 percent reduction.CUMMINS’ WASTE FOOTPRINT

48PRACTICESGLOBAL 
BUILDING STANDARDS
Cummins has nearly 550 facilities 
encompassing more than 34 million  square feet across the globe. During the 
first half of 2016, there were over 30 major 
renovations and new projects planned or underway at the company with a planned capital expense of $800 million over 
multiple years. Having efficient buildings is 
not only a good return on investment, it is critical to reaching Cummins’ energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) goals. 
Cummins’ building standard is based on the 
international standard established by the 
American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 189.1 regarding implementation of energy 
and water efficiency.
While the Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) Silver standard is an industry-respected norm, Cummins believes ASHRAE 189.1 is a 
better fit for the company.
 
 Both the ASHRAE and LEED standards have been recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council. Cummins expects ASHRAE 189.1 to provide better realized 
returns and allow the company to consider 
the total cost of ownership in its buildings. ASHRAE 189.1, with its more international scope, is also a better match for Cummins global footprint. 
At a minimum, all new buildings will 
be ASHRAE 189.1 compliant or LEED Silver equivalent unless an overwhelming argument can be made to do otherwise.  
In most instances, Cummins’ ASHRAE 189.1 compliant buildings would fall between the silver and gold LEED standard.
As part of Cummins’ ongoing efforts to 
reduce GHGs, the company will reduce its 
footprint in new buildings by making four 
considerations when choosing a building site: 
 »The region’s climate. 
 »The carbon intensity of the  
building and site. 
 »The cost of the energy source. 
 »The carbon intensity of the  
energy source.

Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
49PRACTICESTaking these four factors into account  
with the ASHRAE 189.1 standard, Cummins expects its buildings will  
continue to yield significant reductions  
in emissions and GHG’s.
HSE 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The company’s Enterprise Environmental 
Management System (EMS), created in 2003, plays a critical role in Cummins’ 
global environmental footprint reductions 
and other improvements. The company adopted a model that includes a common framework to ensure a similar look, feel  
and fundamental approach throughout  
the organization.
The EMS has the flexibility to allow 
individual sites and businesses to address risks and opportunities most important 
to them. Cummins has integrated health 
and safety processes and procedures with the environment since 2007, in accordance with the international standard 
OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health & 
Safety Management System, to create the Enterprise Health, Safety and Management System (HSEMS). The system has served as the framework for driving continual improvement and efforts beyond compliance at Cummins 
operations around the world. The company 
expects all sites to comply with its policy, procedures and initiatives. 
Broad objectives and targets are set  
at the corporate level to establish  
direction for critical corporate initiatives. 
Cummins’ business units and sites then build upon them to establish site-specific objectives that align with company  
priorities but address site-specific  
needs and challenges. 
Cummins policies apply to more than just 
its employees, extending to contingent workers, suppliers, contractors and 
even customers working at company 
facilities. Cummins’ expectations also extend beyond the company’s physical boundaries, encompassing maintenance 
and support services that occur at  
off-site locations. 
Cummins strategically drives certification  
to recognized international standards. Since 2003, the company has focused  
on its manufacturing locations with  
92 percent of manufacturing sites certified to ISO14001 and OHSAS 18001. By 2016, Cummins expects the HSEMS Enterprise to consist of dual-certified sites, 
representing 100 percent of the company’s 
manufacturing and distribution locations. 
By the end of 2014, the company’s 
independent auditor certified 113 entities, representing 390 sites and corporate 
offices as part of the HSEMS. Cummins’ 
HSEMS scope has been extended to encompass manufacturing joint ventures and distributors. They are committed to 
registering their sites by the end of 2015. 
By incorporating practices and procedures 
into the HSEMS to meet the new ISO 50001 Energy Management Standard, Cummins has delivered a common global 
approach to make energy efficiency a 
standard practice across the company. 
Cummins’ business units and sites then 
build upon them to establish site-specific 
objectives that align with company priorities 
but address site specific needs and challenges. At the global level, nine sites obtained the ISO 50001 energy efficiency certification including two sites certified to 
the Superior Energy Performance Standard 
(ANSI/MSE 50021).  Eleven more sites are working on their  ISO 50001 implementation, with a certification target by end of 2016.
AUDITING 
AND DATA CERTIFICATION
Environmental goals are measured  
through a structured audit process.  A third party auditor, Bureau Veritas 
Certification (BVC), certifies the  
HSEMS and the environmental  metrics Cummins collects. 
Two of Cummins’ key sustainability 
stakeholders, CDP (formerly the Carbon 
Disclosure Project) and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, consider independent data verification an important factor in their evaluation of environmental 
performance and transparency. 
Cummins believes the audit validates 
its efforts at data quality, placing the company among a relatively small number 
that pursue this level of performance and 
validation. Since 2011, BVC has also audited Cummins’ environmental footprint  and the company’s data collection  and verification processes. 
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
50PRACTICESBVC’s audit included greenhouse gases 
(GHGs), water used, landfilled waste and recycled materials. It provided an 
audit report with “limited independent 
assurance,” which the company included as part of its external reporting. Cummins supplements the audit sampling conducted 
by BVC by conducting its own annual 
audits using internally trained HSE auditors. Every site is audited on an annual basis.
The company has developed an internal 
environmental auditor certification process, 
where employees complete a training 
course and then a series of audit levels. In 2015, more than 62 people have been trained and there is a pool of 109 HSE 
leaders certified as HSE Lead Auditors.
This structured audit program validates 
performance and provides a mechanism for HSE auditors to share best practices. Through these practices, Cummins is 
not only improving sites, it is building the 
company’s next generation of HSE leaders. CUMMINS 
IMPROVES 
ENERGY 
PERFORMANCE 
VIA ISO 50001  
AND SEP 
PROGRAM
Measuring real energy performance  
in a complex business is a key  
reason Cummins is implementing  
the international energy management 
standard ISO 50001 and the U.S. 
Department of Energy’s Superior  
Energy Performance (SEP) program. 
 The nine sites currently part of the ISO 50001 and SEP programs represent the complexity of measuring energy improvements across a broad range of 
site requirements and campus structures, 
levels of site automation, local climate, changes in market demand, new product launches and restructuring efforts.  The nine sites are:
 »The Columbus Engine Plant in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A).
 »The Cummins Technical Center,  in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A).
 »The Jamestown Engine Plant in Jamestown, New York (U.S.A).
 »The Rocky Mount Engine Plant in  Rocky Mount, North Carolina (U.S.A.)
 »The Daventry Engine Plant  
in Daventry, U.K.
 »The Darlington Engine Plant  
in Darlington, U.K.
 »Cummins Turbo Technologies  
in Huddersfield, U.K.
 »Cummins Generator Technologies  
in Stamford, U.K.
 »Tata Cummins Limited in  Jamshedpur, India.Seven sites are now certified to ISO 50001 and two (the Cummins Technical Center in Columbus and the Rocky Mount Engine Plant) are both ISO 50001 and Superior 
Energy Performance (SEP) certified.  
The company plans to achieve a total  of 40 certified sites by 2020.
The Energy Management System, through 
the company’s Corporate Enterprise 
approach, recorded a combined energy 
performance improvement of 20 percent by 2015 from a 2010 baseline for just  these nine sites. Annual cost savings were  
$3.5 million per year and 352,434 MMBTU, or 39,740 metric tons of CO
2e (carbon 
dioxide equivalent) reduction.
It has been challenging to develop  
valid energy metrics for specific  
Cummins facilities, and even more  difficult to consolidate site data to  provide meaningful corporate  
performance metrics. The company’s 
enterprise approach to ISO 50001,  the SEP program, and its energy  toolkits now provide the framework  for this effort.

51PRACTICESSEYMOUR 
PLANT QUIETLY ACHIEVES IMPORTANT  GHG REDUCTION MILESTONE
Dec. 3, 2015 was a very good day 
for Matt Abdallah and his team at the Seymour Engine Plant in Seymour, Indiana (U.S.A.).
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
52PRACTICESAfter months of work, and more than a 
year of planning, the lab operations team Abdallah leads used two regenerative 
dynamometers, or regen dynos for short, 
to capture enough energy from the high horsepower engines being tested at the plant to meet all of its electrical needs.
While the dynos had been recovering 
enough power to reduce the plant’s draw from the utility company, this was the first time the draw was zero since the dynos went into operation in the third quarter of 
2015. It only happened for a short time, 
but it was a sign the team’s hard work  was paying off.
“We didn’t have any kind 
of brown out and the lights 
didn’t flicker, which meant  
the power supplied by the 
dynos was of really good 
quality,” said Mike VanLiew, 
the leader of test technology 
for High Horsepower 
Engineering Lab Operations. 
Since then, the plant has reached  
“zero draw” numerous times, including  on March 1, 2016, when the plant was  
 self-generating for more than five hours 
and most likely exporting electricity to  its local utility over that time period.
The Seymour plant builds some of the 
largest engines Cummins makes – the 
QSK95, for example, is 8 feet tall and  14 feet long. High horsepower engines go through a lot of testing before they are released to customers, and that testing 
uses a lot of fuel, which can dramatically 
increase the plant’s carbon footprint. 
To a large extent, however, the power 
generated by the engines during testing at 
Seymour had been lost before the regen 
dynos arrived, converted into heat and dissipated completely by a cooling tower.
Capturing that power using the regen 
dynos means getting more out of the 
fuel used in testing, which is good for the 
environment because it ultimately reduces carbon dioxide (CO
2) emissions. The U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says CO
2 is a key contributor to climate 
change and the primary greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted through human activities.
Cummins has many regen dynos at 
facilities around the world, but the   two installed in test cells 16 and 17 at Seymour are the largest at any location. 
They look like large black boxes, as big  
or bigger than the engines being tested. They take the energy generated by the engines and convert it into electricity that can be handled by what looks like a small 
electrical substation located on plant 
property just outside the test cells.VanLiew is projecting that the regen dynos will produce about 7,000 MWh (megawatt 
hours) of electricity in 2016, which is 
about 20 percent of the site’s total electric consumption in 2015. That will save the equivalent of about one month’s total electric bill and result in an avoidance of 
about 10 percent of the plant’s annual 
GHG emissions.The regen dynos at Seymour  represented a significant 
investment in the plant’s  
test cells and more  evaluation is necessary.  But VanLiew and  Abdallah say the early  
results are promising.

SOLAR ARRAY AT CUMMINS COMING ON LINE IN CHINA
The largest solar array at a Cummins 
facility is scheduled to be completed in 2016 at the Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company Ltd. (BFCEC) in China, eliminating an estimated 3,200 tons of carbon dioxide (CO
2) per year or 
about 13 percent of BFCEC’s overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
54PRACTICESThe initiative will also help with China’s 
national drive to reduce air pollution, cutting back what electricity BFCEC 
consumes from the grid, which is largely 
fueled by coal-fired power plants.
“BFCEC leadership is fully committed to 
improving the environment through the 
business and within the community,” 
said Des Conlon, BFCEC Plant Manager. “Installing solar panels helps combat greenhouse gas emissions and lessens  the current air pollution problem.”
Project Leader Bin Tang said the 3,600 kW 
(kilowatt) system installed on the roof of the plant is also expected to reduce BFCEC’s  overall power costs by about 3 percent, 
saving about 800,000 RMB or roughly 
$121,000 annually.
“This is a great example where using 
renewable energy really makes sense as part of our overall energy strategy,” 
said Mark Dhennin, Director of Energy & 
Environment for Cummins. “We’re reducing CO
2, we’re reducing air 
pollution by reducing demand for electricity from coal-fired plants and we’re lowering 
our operating costs,” he added. “We want 
to use renewable forms of energy like solar to help us achieve our overall mission that everything we do leads to a cleaner, 
healthier, safer environment.” 
BFCEC is composed of two twin plants, 
the ISF and the ISG plants. ISF has been  in operation for several years while the  ISG opened in 2014 and has been  
ramping up production through 2015.
Solar panels will cover about two-thirds of 
the 90,000 square meter (970,000 square foot) ISF plant, which will receive about  
4.2 million kWh (kilowatt hour) of power 
when the solar cells are fully operational. The ISF plant’s overall power consumption was around 19.5 million kWh in 2015, so about 19 percent of the plant’s power will 
no longer be pulled from the national grid.
The next largest solar installation at 
Cummins is the 2,000 kW array installed  at the Jamestown Engine Plant in  
 
  Jamestown, New York (U.S.A.) in 2015. Eleven Cummins facilities now have solar arrays. The others are located in Australia, 
Belgium, China, the United Kingdom and 
the United States. 
The facility in Belgium has a maximum 
output of 562 kW while the others are  
50 kW or less. All of the solar initiatives 
have had some kind of government incentive. The solar array in Beijing is actually owned by an independent  third party. 
The panels at BFCEC are partially installed 
but already connected to the facility grid and will power equipment such as the boilers and water pump station for the 
ISF plant, said Shuquan Gao, the Facility 
Manager who was instrumental in the contract negotiations to get the solar  array installed.
“BFCEC is going to be an important  
part of our renewable energy strategy,”  
said Dhennin. “I want to congratulate  Des and his team for their great work  on this initiative.” CUMMINS ONSITE SOLAR

55PRACTICESFIRST SITES 
CERTIFIED AS 
‘ZERO DISPOSAL’
Leaders at the first Cummins  
sites certified by the company as  
“Zero Disposal” facilities say slow but 
steady progress that builds employee 
support for reuse and recycling was 
critical to their success.
“Do not try to boil the ocean,” said Jennifer Hirst, a facilities engineer at one of the  
sites, Cummins Turbo Technologies (CTT) at Huddersfield in the United Kingdom.  
“Small, individual steps will slowly amalgamate into a big difference and change in culture.”
Cummins defines Zero Disposal as handling 100 percent of waste in a truly useful manner. 
That means waste doesn’t go to a landfill and can only be incinerated at a waste-to-energy 
facility after reasonable efforts to reduce, re-use and recycle. It must produce more energy 
than needed to merely sustain combustion. The first four sites certified by the company 
in 2015 as achieving Zero Disposal include 
CTT in Huddersfield and two other sites  in the U.K.: the Darlington Engine Plant  and the Daventry Engine Plant. In addition, 
the company certified the Cummins 
Filtration Plant in Quimper, France that same year. Cummins Global Logistics (CGL) Belgium is the most recent site achieving Zero Disposal status.  
It was certified in April 2016.Cummins has a robust certification process to determine if sites are managing their 
waste effectively and that vendors are properly handling material both at the company site and if it leaves that location.
Collectively, the first four locations certified 
generated almost 26 million pounds of waste in 2014 that had to be recycled  or reused in some way to achieve the  Zero Disposal designation.
THIRTY 
BY 2020
As part of its 
environmental 
sustainability plan,  
the company has set  
as a goal increasing its 
overall recycling rate  
from about 90 percent 
in 2014 to 95 percent 
by 2020. In addition, 
Cummins wants to reach 
Zero Disposal status at  
30 sites by 2020.
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
56PRACTICESIn all four cases, these plants had been 
moving away from landfills for some time. In both France and the U.K., there are fees 
and taxes in place to discourage waste 
disposal in landfills. That, along with the overall cost of waste handling, provided plenty of incentive for the sites to reuse  
and recycle to reduce costs.
But getting that last 1 or 2 percent of  
waste required tackling hard to recycle items such as food waste and food packaging brought into the plants.  
 In Darlington, for example, there are 
separate bins for plastic, aluminum,  paper cups from vending machines,  
office paper, oily rags and gloves,  
and food and floor dust. 
Environmental leaders at the Zero Disposal 
locations say communication is critical. 
Several plants maintain information boards 
that regularly update employees on what’s happening with plant waste. All of the certified sites also say their waste streams are constantly evolving. Just because they achieved Zero Disposal 
status once doesn’t mean they will keep 
that designation in the years that follow.
“Regulations and technology are  
constantly changing,” said Gary Botterill, 
Senior Plant Engineer at Daventry.  
“How you handle something today  may not be the same tomorrow.  So there’s plenty of opportunity  for continuous improvement.”

59PRACTICESPARTNERSHIPS 
AND POLICY
Cummins’ partnerships and its policy 
advocacy efforts play key roles in the 
company’s environmental performance.  
They help Cummins meet product 
emission goals, use energy more 
efficiently and bring environmental 
solutions to the marketplace.
Four of the company’s 10  
environmental sustainability principles  
focus on partnerships with legislative  
and regulatory entities to develop sound  
public policy that reduces Cummins’ 
impact on the environment. They are:
 »Help develop responsible regulations.
 »Promote technology development.
 »Advocate for incentives to  
accelerate progress.
 »Support a balanced global approach. Cummins worked closely with the U.S. 
government and a variety of stakeholders, for example, to develop the first-ever 
greenhouse gas (GHG) and fuel efficiency 
standards in the United States in 2014 for medium- and heavy-duty commercial  vehicles and engines. These standards 
became known as the "Phase 1 Rule."
The company is now working to  
help shape future Phase 2 standards.  When the U.S. Environmental Protection   Agency (EPA) and the Department of 
Transportation’s National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration (NHTSA) released their joint Phase 2 proposal in June 2015,  Cummins announced its support for the rulemaking, testifying at a public hearing 
and submitting detailed written comments. 
A key aspect for Phase 2 is to maintain  
the same regulatory structure with  separate standards for the engine and the 
rest of the vehicle. Separate standards 
are critical for the regulation to achieve environmental and user benefits while recognizing the diversity and complexity  of the commercial vehicle sector.
The company’s engagement on future 
regulations will not end with finalization of  the Phase 2 Rule expected later in 2016, nor is it limited to just the U.S. 
For example, the California Air Resources 
Board’s (CARB) call for lower on-highway engine oxides of nitrogen (NOx) standards and plans by countries to adopt tougher Euro NOx standards mean Cummins  
will continue to share technical and  
policy expertise in partnership with  its stakeholders around the world.R&D 
COLLABORATION 
Cummins longstanding partnerships with 
the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)  and other federal and state agencies 
directly support international goals of 
reducing GHG emissions and national goals of reducing petroleum  consumption and dependency. 
These partnerships help Cummins lead 
the United States and other markets in energy productivity while continuing to reduce criteria emissions from global transportation and distributed power 
generation fleets.The company’s current 
public-private projects involving DOE, except where noted, include:
 »The Cummins-led SLTNR (Sustained  
Low Temperature NOx Reduction) 
project, partnering with Johnson-Matthey and Pacific Northwest  National Laboratory, continues to  make progress on Selective Catalytic 
Reduction (SCR) catalyst and reductant 
delivery technologies capable of sustained 90 percent NOx conversion at 150 degree C. The goal is improved 
robustness of future high performance NOx aftertreatment systems under 
challenging real world conditions.
 »The EDPCI (E85/Diesel Premixed 
Compression Ignition) project’s goal  
is to demonstrate high efficiency  dual-fuel engine operation in a Class  8 (long haul) truck.The project hopes 
to achieve a more than 50 percent 
reduction in petroleum consumption by making extensive use of E85 (85 percent ethanol / 15 percent gasoline) and diesel fuel. Completion of engine development, 
vehicle integration and demonstration 
testing is expected to take place in 2016.
 »The 55BTE Program goal is to demonstrate 55 percent brake thermal 
efficiency (BTE) in a diesel-only 
configuration by building on lessons from the analytically-based technology scoping phase of the SuperTruck program. The 55BTE program will also  
lay critical groundwork for a future 
SuperTruck system integration project  to advance the performance, cost, and commercial viability of a suite of engine /
powertrain and vehicle technologies.

 »The HD Ultra-Low NOx Natural Gas program, partnering with California’s 
South Coast Air Quality Management 
District (SCAQMD) and other California entities, was completed at less than 0.02 gram/bhp-hr NOx technologies, while maximizing engine efficiency. 
The program defined several important 
new technologies to narrow the efficiency gap between state-of-the-art diesel and natural gas engines.
Underlying Cummins’ system-integration programs is a valuable portfolio of collaborative research and development agreements that team, and fund, world class researchers at the DOE’s system  
of national laboratories with their 
counterparts at Cummins. 
They jointly work on such things as 
combustion modeling and diagnostics, 
materials science, catalysis fundamentals, 
powertrain electrification/hybridization  and more. ENVIRONMENTAL 
DEFENSE FUND 
Cummins continues to collaborate with  
the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) to learn more about fugitive methane 
emissions from natural gas vehicles  
and the fuel supply chain. 
Through the sponsorship of a series  
of 16 independent studies, EDF is 
coordinating the work of close to  
100 universities, research facilities and industry partners contributing to this research including Cummins and the  joint venture Cummins Westport. 
Data is being collected in five core  
areas: production, gathering lines  and processing facilities, long-distance pipelines and storage, local  
distribution and commercial trucks  
and refueling stations.
As producers of natural gas engines, 
Cummins and Cummins Westport are contributing to the study of fugitive 
methane emissions related to evaporative 
losses and incomplete combustion  from vehicles, and fugitive emissions associated with fueling infrastructure.  
 The study is led by West Virginia  
University. The results of the study  were submitted for peer-review in 2015.
GOVERNMENT 
RELATIONS 
The company’s Government Relations 
staff advocates globally for policies, legislation, government research funding 
and regulatory guidelines that promote 
products and technologies that benefit  the environment. 
Its efforts in the United States include 
working with Congress, the White House, 
state governments, trade associations and industry to support the EPA in developing fuel efficiency regulations for heavy-duty vehicles, and to broadly educate policy 
makers about how regulations, economic 
development and competitiveness can flourish if developed properly. 
In India, Cummins pushed for the release 
of a formal schedule to move to Euro 
IV emissions regulations. The Indian government announced that India will transition to a single, nationwide Euro IV norm in a phased timeline. Cummins 
supports the recent announcement by the  
 GRANT TO  
FUND HYBRID  
ELECTRIC VEHICLE
Cummins was awarded a $4.5 million grant in  
April 2016 from the U.S. Department of Energy to  
develop a Class 6 commercial plug-in hybrid electric  
vehicle that can reduce fuel consumption by at least  
50 percent over conventional Class 6 vehicles.
When fully loaded, a class 6 vehicle weighs between  
about 19,000 and 26,000 pounds. Typical examples  
include school buses or single axle work trucks.
Cummins researchers will optimize the powertrain by  
selecting the engine with the best architecture to use as  
an electric commercial vehicle range extender, using the  
engine to manage the charge level of the all-electric drive  
battery pack. The range extender will be integrated, using 
advanced vehicle controls, with the electrified powertrain  
and other applicable technologies.
Ultimately, the researchers aim to demonstrate improved  
fuel consumption and state of the art drivability and  
performance regardless of environmental conditions.
Cummins is partnering with PACCAR on the project,  
and the full team includes representatives from The Ohio  
State University, National Renewable Energy Laboratory  
and Argonne National Laboratory.

ACADEMIC 
PARTNERSHIPS 
Cummins has continued to partner with 
dozens of universities around the world to collaborate on important environmental 
research topics. 
Cummins’ collaboration with Tsinghua 
University in China, for example, began in 2003, and is both an academic and a 
research collaboration. The Dr. Alyn Lyn 
Scholarship is named for the late Vice President of Research at Cummins  and a 1939 graduate of Tsinghua.  It was established in 2004, first with  
 Tsinghua University before expanding  
to 13 universities in China, benefitting  more than 400 students.
As of 2015, there were more than  
20 Tsinghua graduates working at Cummins, both in United States and in China. Cummins and Tsinghua have also 
been collaborating on multiple projects, 
focusing on clean and renewable energy. 
The Cummins Innovation Centre, 
meanwhile, opened in 2012 and  is a five-year strategic alliance  
between Cummins and the  
University of Nottingham in the  United Kingdom. The focus of the  alliance is on the research of electrical 
machines and related technologies, 
in particular generator technologies  such as gensets and synchronous generators, power electronics and  electrical machines, integrated drive 
systems and technologies and  
strategies for enhanced heat transfer. BUSINESS COALITIONS  
AND COUNCILS 
Cummins is a member of several key non-profit organizations that  
promote sustainability and responsible technology, including: 
 »The Diesel Technology Forum, which is dedicated to raising awareness about 
the importance of diesel engines, fuel and technology. Since it was founded in 
2000, the forum has emerged as a leading source of information on agriculture, economics, energy, the environment, transportation and trade issues impacting diesel technology.
 »The Health Effects Institute, founded by the EPA and industry leaders including Cummins, is a non-partisan organization committed to providing high-quality, impartial,and relevant science regarding the effects of air pollution on health.

MONTH SETS 
NEW RECORD
What started as a grassroots effort in one Cummins business unit  
a few years ago has now grown to more than 30,000 employees and  
67 global sites participating in the company’s June Environment Month.
While participation has tripled since 2014, the message remains the same: Even small 
actions taken consistently across the company can make a big difference. 
Cummins employees in Qatar, for example, reduced their paper printing  
by 75 percent in one week. Employees in Mexico planted 300 trees while  
their counterparts in the U.K. upgraded to energy efficient lightbulbs.  
There were energy fairs, carpool arrangements and climate change quiz shows. 
In 2014, Cummins adopted its first comprehensive environmental sustainability  
plan and introduced goals to reduce the company’s energy use and greenhouse  
gas emissions, water use and waste production. June Environment Month is a  
way for all employees to deliver on Cummins’ mission that “everything we do  
leads to a cleaner, healthier, safer environment.” 
The month is organized by environmental theme, with one week devoted to water,  
another to waste and still another to energy activities. A planning team provides  
structure and ideas, and employees are unleashed to tailor activities to their  
own site’s particular expertise and interests.

63PARTNERSHIPSCATALYSTS FOR 
FUEL EFFICIENCY
From his desk in Columbus, Indiana 
(U.S.A), Cummins Fuel Economy 
Engineer David Yu uses sophisticated 
tools to tell customers details about  
their operations thousands of miles  
away that even personnel on the  
ground might not know.
He analyzes large amounts of data about the time engines are working and  
idling in various locations, the fuel they consume, the distances they travel and  
many more factors to suggest ways customers can get better fuel economy,  
resulting in a corresponding reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
“We’ve got incredibly talented people helping our customers operate Cummins products 
more efficiently throughout the company,” said David O’Brien, Director – Fuel Economy and 
Engine Business Unit Sustainability. “David (Yu) is doing some tremendous work, but most 
of what’s happening in this area is taking place at customer sites, where we’re working  
side-by-side to save fuel and at the same time reduce GHGs.”Cummins has set a goal of partnering  
with its customers to reach an annual 
reduction of 3.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO
2) by 2020, saving  
350 million gallons of fuel annually. 
Cummins estimates that about 99 percent 
of its CO2 footprint is attributable to its 
engines when used by the company’s 
customers. CO2 is the primary greenhouse 
gas emitted through human activities, according to the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA).
The perpetually energetic O’Brien is  
leading the company’s efforts to meet  what Cummins calls its “Products  
In-Use Goal.” An engineer by training  
who worked for many years in marketing, O’Brien is part scientist and part promoter, always encouraging his fellow employees to work with customers to achieve greater 
and greater fuel efficiency.
Along with his team consisting of Yu and 
Bill Kendrick, Technical Advisor – Vehicle Performance, O’Brien is implementing 
a strategy to reach the company’s goal 
across all engine and global market segments, with a special emphasis on large on-highway fleets of trucks and off-highway operations such as mining.
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
64PARTNERSHIPSThe team works with personnel across the 
company to help improve fuel efficiency when Cummins products are in use.
O’Brien, for example, meets regularly with 
the fuel economy team at Cummins India led by Amol Wairagade. Wairagade’s team is working from a list of some two-dozen 
projects it wants to complete to help 
customers get better fuel economy.
The ideas range from developing  
stop-start technology for bus customers to creating a way for heavy-duty truck drivers 
to easily change to a fuel efficiency setting. 
“We want our customers to be the  
market leaders on fuel economy,” Wairagade said. “We know how important 
fuel costs can be to their profitability.” 
O’Brien’s experience in marketing  
can be seen in the internal website  he’s started and the newsletter he produces extolling the work of teams  
like Wairagade’s and the virtues of fuel 
efficiency both for the environment  and the customer’s bottom line.

AND THE 
ENVIRONMENT
Engineers at Cummins’ Darlington Engine Plant in the U.K. and their 
counterparts at the Hyster-Yale Group (HYG), a leading manufacturer 
of materials handling equipment, have produced some pretty 
impressive gains in fuel efficiency over the past six years.
Working together on nearly 20 projects, the partnership has delivered annual  
fuel savings in excess of 2 million gallons since the initiative started in 2010,  
with plans to top 4 million by the end of 2016. 
“We’ve really moved from trying to improve fuel economy after the vehicle has been 
designed and validated to working together with HYG to make sure fuel economy  
and optimization is considered from the start of a new project,” said Ben Kilpatrick,  
Application Engineer at Cummins for the HYG account. “It’s been great to see how this 
partnership has grown just in the time since I joined the team in 2014, following on from  
Andrew Skinner, who developed this new approach with HYG in 2010.”

66PARTNERSHIPSJan-Willem van den Brand, Big Truck 
Strategy & Application Center Manager at the Hyster-Yale Group, said HYG doesn’t 
buy anything off the shelf and put it into its 
lift trucks and container handlers. It wants to partner with its suppliers to ensure superb integration and optimization, so 
customers get the reliable and durable 
solution they need to succeed.
 “We really wanted to achieve 
a significant improvement 
in fuel efficiency for our 
customers and for the 
environment,” van den  
Brand said. “So we had  
very high expectations  
for this partnership.  
Cummins has proven  
to be the right partner.” Cummins has a multi-disciplinary team 
of engineers at Darlington that works with HYG’s team based in Nijmegen, 
Netherlands. The Cummins team 
includes engineers focused on engine system installation, machine integration, transmission integration and system 
optimization, including advanced system 
modeling and analysis to fully understand both HYG’s and the end-user’s needs.
The partnership has worked on a range 
of projects primarily involving forklifts, 
high capacity forklifts, reach stackers and 
container handlers. In one successful collaboration, the partnership determined that an HYG product could save fuel by 
using a smaller engine and still provide 
customers with the power needed to 
complete the desired task. Other examples have included the joint development of user selectable machine operating modes, 
such as “Eco” and “HiPower,” to ensure 
customers achieve both productivity and fuel economy targets.
“Nobody knows their products and 
customers better than HYG,” said Niki 
Schönau, who has led Fuel Economy Functional Excellence for the Cummins team since 2015. “We want to be experts on the integration and optimization of 
our engines in their products to help 
meet fuel economy targets, performance requirements and most importantly their business goals. By working cross 
functionally and globally across Cummins, 
as well as directly with HYG and its suppliers, we have been able to achieve excellent results.”
HYG recently announced that it won a 
2015 GOOD DESIGN™ award for its  
Tier 4 Final RS45-46 Reach Stacker. Presented by the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design, 
GOOD DESIGN honors yearly 
achievements of extraordinary design excellence. The Tier 4 Final Reach  Stacker was selected based on its  efficient engine technology and  
productivity enhancing design.
“The engineering teams at HYG Nijmegen 
and Cummins Darlington have worked very closely together for many years” said Bill 
Pearce, Director of Customer Engineering 
in Europe for Cummins. “Together they have developed and utilized new tools and processes to ensure optimization and improved fuel economy is designed into 
every new project from the very beginning.”
HYG’s van den Brand agrees that 
experience working together is critical. His company only brings to its customers 
products that have been thoroughly tested, 
part of its “Promise to Proof” approach. That makes it critical for HYG personnel to be at the forefront of the development cycle for innovations to reach customers as 
quickly as possible.
“Hyster test trucks were the first machines 
equipped with Tier 4i and Tier4F engines, undergoing thousands of hours of testing 
in the field before they were officially 
launched,” van den Brand said. “Cummins has worked with our test engineers to combine our companies’ testing programs. We will only bring reliable and durable 
solutions to our customers.”

Countries in emerging markets don’t

building economic wealth, Cummins 
Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger told 
a major conference on corporate social 
responsibility in November 2015. 
PARTNERSHIPS
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
68By working with joint-venture partners in 
emerging countries to address realistic and enforceable emissions standards, 
Cummins can help those countries 
significantly reduce air pollution using technologies the company can produce  at a much lower cost today than when  
they were first introduced, Linebarger  
told the BSR (formerly Business for  Social Responsibility) conference in  San Francisco, California (U.S.A.). 
“One of the things that’s 
definitely happening is that 
in emerging markets, where 
many countries are trying  
to build wealth for the 
first time, they are seeing 
concentrations of air 
pollutants in their cities 
that are just staggering,” 
Linebarger told the 
conference. 
But he said those countries don’t  
have to choose between creating  wealth and clean air.
 
  “It’s all about trying to get them to  toughen their emission standards and  
the way that we do that is we try to walk  
in and say, ‘Look, we have technology  that we put in the U.S. in 1998 or 1995 and today it is reliable, it is inexpensive  and we can partner with local companies  
in your country,’” Linebarger said.
“...We’ll partner with them. We’ll joint  
venture with them. They’ll learn this technology,” he added. “So it’s not just  
that we’re going to come in and take  
all the revenue as a foreign company.”
A Cummins joint venture is  
currently producing a truck engine  in China, for example, that meets  
that country’s NS4 emission standards. 
Those standards are roughly equivalent  to the 2002 U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. 
Cummins has found ways to produce  
the engine package designed to meet China’s regulations for about 35 percent less than it cost 13 years ago to meet  the EPA standards then, Linebarger said.Linebarger’s speech came as delegates started to gather in Paris to discuss  
ways to address climate change across  
the globe. One of the key issues raised  by developing countries was balancing their industrial growth with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
“What we can do now is bring 
great technology to countries 
at a much lower cost,” 
Linebarger said. “Why does 
that matter? It encourages 
governments in developing 
countries to put in tighter 
emission standards with less 
impact to their economy.”
But realistic, enforceable regulations  
are critical, he said. By its nature,  clean air is a public benefit that is 
essentially funded privately. 
“Enforceability is critical,” Linebarger said. 
“If enforceability's inconsistent, basically the only loser is the one who complies.  
So it's a really critical element to our 
strategy - drive the technology,  drive the emissions regulations  to be stringent, and enforceable.”ABOUT BSR
BSR, formerly Business for

69PARTNERSHIPSWang, a Senior Administration Assistant, 
received Cummins’ 2015 Community Impact Six Sigma Chairman’s Award 
for improving workplace conditions at a 
center for adults with disabilities. By using her business skills to address a particular outcome – called the “Y” in Six Sigma’s 
data-driven approach to eliminating 
manufacturing defects – Wang exemplified Cummins’ new strategic vision for employee engagement.
“We can utilize our talent 
to help people and other 
communities in need,”  
Wang said. “As the Chinese 
saying goes, ‘Give a man  
a fish and he can eat for  
a day; teach a man to fish, 
he’ll eat for a lifetime.’”
Wang did just that by helping the center 
find new ways to assemble washing-machine parts to protect employees’ 
hands. She also worked on a new layout 
for the center’s assembly line to increase efficiency and enhance employee safety.
In 2015, to maximize all employees’ 
opportunities to help others, Cummins’

For many beginning a journey,  
“X marks the spot” to their ultimate reward. But at Cummins Turbo Technologies in Wuxi, China,  Wang Jie pursued “Y,” not for  her benefit but rather for others.  Her story – and strategy – represents the future of  Corporate Responsibility  at Cummins.CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

community strategies. Wang’s project, for 
example, aligned with Cummins China’s regional strategy to increase independence 
among people with disabilities. Other 
regions’ goals are as diverse as the company’s global teams.
“Cummins employees have specialized 
skills to help people in our communities,” 
said Mary Titsworth Chandler, Cummins’ Executive Director of Corporate Responsibility. “When we add strategic principles to organize those unique  
talents, the impact is powerful.”
Like China’s strategy, the Middle East’s 
plan includes better integrating people with special needs into society and also 
educating youth on the environment. 
In India, Cummins leaders built their strategy around replicating the successes employees have had developing villages’ water supplies, farms, hygiene and 
schools. In Africa, every Cummins site 
is partnering with a school with a high population of students at risk of failing to raise their academic performance. 
 
  Among Cummins’ North American sites, employees are mentoring low-income  students to help them pursue college  
or careers. European leaders will be 
focusing on strengthening students’ aspirations and reducing food poverty.  In Mexico, teams have organized their 
efforts into a “neighborhood approach”  
in La Pila – a model South America is also pursuing because of its effectiveness.
And in the Asia-Pacific region, Cummins’ 
teams are expanding their TEC: Technical 
Education for Communities initiative to 
increase the availability of skilled workers and good jobs.
“Our employees can have a 
profound effect on others’ 
lives,” said Peter Jensen-
Muir, Executive Managing 
Director of Cummins’ 
Asia-Pacific Distribution 
Business Unit. “Cummins 
has a rich history serving our 
communities and, because 
of our employees and 
forward-looking strategies, 
more abundant engagement activities in the years ahead.”Cummins’ commitment to Corporate 
Responsibility has been a core value at the company since its founding in 1919. 
In 2015, 53,749 employees, joint venture 
employees and contractors honored that tradition by engaging in a community project – a record 80 percent  
of eligible employees. 
In doing so, they assessed gaps their  
skills could address and strategized  on where and how to create  impact – just as Wang Jie did.
Although Cummins employees’  
“Ys” might be varied, their “Why”  is the same. And just like Wang  Jie’s proverb, in 2015, their  
new strategies found where  
Cummins can help people  in need net even  greater opportunities.

AN IMPACTFUL 
LEADER RETIRES 
AFTER 42 YEARS 
WITH CUMMINS
Mark Levett was just the  
leader Cummins needed to direct  
Corporate Responsibility’s evolution 
toward creating greater impact in 
communities. He did exactly that in  
a variety of positions over his  
42 years with the company.
“Cummins has benefitted greatly from Mark’s business expertise, his strong work  
ethic and his skills as a great listener and keen observer of people,” said Cummins 
Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger and President and Chief Operating Officer Rich 
Freeland in a joint statement on Levett’s retirement in 2015. “Mark’s modest nature  
masks the enormous impact he has had on our company.”In 2013, Levett became Vice President 
of Corporate Responsibility after working 
almost exclusively on the business side  of the company for most of his career.  He was long known as an executive  who truly lived Cummins’ values in 
everything he did.
As the leader of Corporate Responsibility, 
Levett expanded Cummins’ community engagement globally while tasking 
company leaders to create strategies 
aligned to the needs of their regions –  a goal Levett’s close colleague and successor, Mary Titsworth Chandler,  will continue.“The community impact  
Mark created was a seamless 
continuation of his many 
years of impressive business 
results,” said Chandler. 
“Yet what Mark will truly 
be remembered for is his 
professionalism and kindness. 
We miss him.”CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

Wissam Balshe and Shalaw Mohammed 
knew it would be difficult to  convert one sheet of paper into  33,667 kilowatts of uninterrupted  clean energy for a wilderness  center in Ely, Minnesota (U.S.A.).  But they were up to the challenge.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Employees in 
Fridley, Minnesota 
(U.S.A.) developed 
an innovative,  
fuel-saving  
micro grid to 
provide clean 
energy to a 
wilderness  
center.
73
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
Of course, that piece of paper is just where Balshe and Mohammed started writing  
their plans for an innovative, fuel-saving micro grid. Without it, their community  service project never would have been selected as one of the winners in Cummins’  
2015 Environmental Challenge.
“It was very rewarding to lead a project all the way from an idea on paper to a full-scale 
example of what a robust, clean system should look like,” said Mohammed, a Sales Representative for Cummins Power Systems. His team’s project saved 14.3 metric tons  
of carbon dioxide (CO
2) in 2015 by linking solar panels, batteries and a diesel generator  
to provide power at the Steger Wilderness Center.Like Mohammed and Balshe, 21,600 Cummins employees from 30 countries converted 
similar ideas to projects as part of the company’s seventh-annual employee competition  to conserve water and energy, and reduce waste in communities around the world.  
A panel of Cummins environmental experts evaluated entries based on their levels  
of employee engagement, environmental impact and overall ingenuity.
The 88 projects submitted in 2015 reduced the equivalent of 36,810 metric tons 
of greenhouse gas (GHG), a new company record. Eighteen were named global 
Environmental Challenge winners.“It is our duty to preserve natural resources so that needs can be met not only in the 
present but also for future generations,” said Moysés Silva, a Plant Engineering Supervisor who led an Environmental Challenge project in Brazil. “We had 
an amazing experience helping others 
understand the importance of good environmental practices.”
MAKING  
AN IMPACT
Silva and his team worked with their local 
water department to create quality cisterns for collecting rainwater and informational 
pamphlets on how to do it safely.
Since 2009, water levels in Brazil’s 
reservoirs have dropped dramatically, causing residents to preserve rainwater 
for watering plants and other non-potable 
purposes in ways that led to an increase in dengue-fever mosquitos. To encourage proper water conservation, Cummins employees distributed 50 cisterns to 
families and educated 320 students  
at a nearby school.

IMPACT BY  
THE NUMBERS
Here’s a look at the global impact of  
Cummins’ 2015 Environmental Challenge:“It’s being well used,” said Aparecido 
Saraiva, a local resident, when asked  about his new cistern designed to keep 
insects out. “I was able to fill up four  
extra buckets.”
Households were similarly engaged in 
Pune, India, where Cummins employees 
continued their 2011 project to reduce the 
amount of waste going to local landfills. By educating residents in the Katraj and Baner wards to segregate garbage at their homes, employees helped cut waste sent 
to landfills by five tons and increased the 
quantity going to a biogas energy station by 150 percent.
“It is a very special feeling 
you get when you have the 
chance to make a little impact 
on the community,” said 
Pranjal Kelkar, an Executive 
Manager at Cummins India. 
“This was achieved mostly 
through changing the  
mindset of the community 
through various awareness  
campaigns involving more 
than 15,000 citizens and  15,000 school children.”Kelkar’s project is now being replicated 
by the Pune Municipal Corporation across 32 wards, something Silva wants to do in 
Brazil with his team’s cisterns and Balshe 
wants to accomplish in Minnesota with  the micro grid. 
SHOWCASING 
NEW IDEAS
“I hope it becomes a showcase for  
new energy technologies,” said Balshe,  a Power Systems Territory Manager,  
“and that the Steger Wilderness Center 
uses it to educate residents and high school students on different ways to reduce their carbon footprint.”
 In 2016, they will have the opportunity 
to do exactly that through Cummins Foundation support Balshe and Mohammed directed to the center.  
Every Environmental Challenge winner  
is awarded a $10,000 grant for a local community organization of each  team’s choosing.
For Cummins employees,  
however, the real reward is in the  
air they helped clean, the water  they saved, and the environment  they preserved. Although they took  
the Environmental Challenge,  
it was their communities that  ultimately won.CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

TEC OPENS MINDS 
…AND DOORS
Berfu Alev and her “family”  
of female students in Izmir, Turkey,  are changing perceptions of what  it means to work in a technical  career. Like others in Cummins’  TEC: Technical Education for Communities program, family  has been a motivating factor  in their success. 
“I think I can help other girls in the 
technical field,” said Alev, a student at Ege University. “I try to remove the stigmas and 
stereotypes associated with the ‘dirtiness’ 
of a technical career and highlight the state-of-the-art equipment that today’s professionals use.”TEC is a global initiative by Cummins  to address communities’ technical skills gaps through vocational education. 
Alev’s school is one of 14 TEC sites 
that Cummins and its industry partners have opened since 2011. In 2015, sites launched in Arequipa, Peru; Kohlapur,

“The technical skills gap 
has created a two-sided 
economic problem in many 
of our communities around 
the globe,” said Cummins 
Chairman and CEO Tom 
Linebarger, the company’s 
lead sponsor for TEC.  
“On the one hand, employers 
cannot find enough qualified 
people to fill critical 
technician roles. And, on the other hand, many able people 
cannot find good paying jobs.
“By helping young people obtain in-
demand technical skills, we can expand employment opportunities and improve the 
quality of life in our communities,” he said.
The students participating in TEC 
come from diverse backgrounds and socioeconomic levels. Many believe  
the program is the catalyst they need to 
succeed and give back to their families – often the people integral to their pursuit  of a technical education.“Both my father and older brother left 
school early to work and have encouraged 
me to get an education so I’ll have a stable future,” said Mert Nahit Karakus, a third-year TEC student studying mechatronics 
at Ege University. “To have a job in the 
technical field is an opportunity that will totally change my future.” 
Karakus was a summer intern at  
Cummins’ Filtration facility in Izmir in  
2015. Workplace learning opportunities 
are a core component of TEC to ensure students engage in hands-on training 
before graduation. Across all TEC 
initiatives, 107 students participated in internships during 2015.
Come summer 2016, Karakus will be a 
member of TEC’s first graduating class,  
as will Meryem Zerouali, a 22-year-old student at the Morocco TEC site in Casablanca. Her interest in mechanics started at a very young age. 
“It’s kind of funny because I didn’t have any 
technical experience before I enrolled in TEC, but I’ve always been curious  
about fixing problems in cars,” Zerouali 
said. “I can thank my uncle for that.”
As Zerouali and her fellow students 
graduate from the program, Cummins 
and its industry partners will measure 
graduates’ job-placement rates, knowledge retention, their compensation relative to a “living wage” and employer feedback on their skills and attitudes.
Zerouali feels prepared for her future.“I’m confident that I will be able to get a  
job based on my current training at the 
school and at my internship,” she said.
Alev, meanwhile, will likely continue 
opening others’ eyes to what a technical 
career can mean and her example may 
inspire more young women as TEC expands to 20 sites by 2017.
“I believe that women employed in the 
technical areas will increase,” Alev said, 
“and people’s ideas about women in  
the workplace will slowly change.”

A NEW PACT 
TO EMPOWER 
COMMUNITIES
Cummins’ community  
engagement efforts got a  
new source of energy in 2015.
Schneider Electric joined  
Cummins in July 2015 to announce 
a global partnership for Corporate 
Responsibility, building upon the two  
companies’ shared history empowering  
women in Turkey, training students 
in Nigeria and building homes for 
disadvantaged families in Minnesota. 
 “Working together, Cummins and Schneider Electric can use our global  
footprint, and the strength of our employees’ skills, to drive even greater  
change in our communities,” said Mark Levett, Cummins’ then-Vice  President of Corporate Responsibility.
The new partnership will focus on providing more communities around  
the world with affordable, clean power through Schneider Electric’s Access  
to Energy program, and skills training for quality jobs through Cummins’  TEC: Technical Education for Communities initiative.
“We share a belief with Cummins that, as organizations with expertise and  
scale, we have a responsibility to actively support efforts to improve our  
communities and our world,” said Francois Milioni, who leads Schneider  
Electric’s Access to Energy initiative. “By joining forces to further animate  this belief, we will be able to do more collectively than we could individually  and increase the positive impacts we can make for our society.”
Cummins will continue to pursue such global partnerships to increase employees’  
impact in their communities. In 2016, the company signed a similar agreement  with Komatsu Ltd. to improve industry relevant technical skills training and access  to good-paying jobs among disadvantaged populations.CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

its 260 students. There, while tending the produce, company employees like Ary J. Loredo, an Accounts Payable Analyst for 
CBS Mexico, taught Lopez and her peers 
about environmental stewardship. 
The activity was just one component  
of Cummins’ “neighborhood approach”  in La Pila, the community where the  
school is located.
“I see a great benefit from Cummins’ 
partnership with our school,” said  Arturo Jaramillo, a teacher at Bocanegra 
Elementary. “They are teaching us to work 
in an organized way, consider risks when implementing ideas and helping kids think and act.”
Jaramillo, however, doesn’t give himself 
enough credit. After all, it was his own 
“act” that led to Cummins’ partnership with Bocanegra and broader interest in La Pila.In 2013, Cummins had around  500 community events taking place  across San Luis Potosí. Although each 
had value, company leaders could not tell 
if any were creating a lasting, measurable difference. Accordingly, leaders chose to focus employees’ engagement in a 
community that had much to gain from 
their skills, time and resources. They just had to find the right one.
Working with graduate students from the 
Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, 
Cummins teams analyzed neighborhoods 
lagging in education, environmental protection and employment. With middle school dropout rates around 50 percent, 
streets littered with trash and 33 percent  
of residents stuck in poverty, La Pila was at the top of their list. That’s when Cummins employees heard about Jaramillo.
The Bocanegra Elementary teacher 
contacted Cummins to see if the company 
would consider supporting his school. Employees – already preparing to meet with La Pila stakeholders following the 
Universidad assessment – added Jaramillo 
to their list of appointments.“In Arturo Jaramillo and other 
La Pila leaders, we found 
a community not content 
with the status quo,” said 
Andrea Villegas, a Product 
Engineer in Cummins’ Engine 
Business who sponsored her 
team’s engagement in La Pila. 
“Upon seeing their passion 
for change and interest in 
something greater, we knew 
La Pila was the place where Cummins employees could 
make a measurable impact.”
And so the company’s neighborhood 
approach began, with Cummins establishing long-term goals to 
increase La Pila students’ enrollment 
in higher education, encourage greater environmental care among residents  and develop opportunities for  
employment and entrepreneurship.  
Those goals ultimately led to such  projects as Bocanegra’s organic  garden and other forms of cultivation. 
For example, in 2015, 48 participants 
from nine La Pila schools participated in 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
the LISTO Transformational Leadership 
Program to improve students’ academic performance levels. Cummins brought 
LISTO’s operator, the nonprofit Worldfund, 
and the San Luis Potosí Ministry of Education together to implement coaching workshops across La Pila’s schools. 
Outside those schools, La Pila’s heavily 
littered streets prompted Cummins employees to launch a campaign called “I am responsible for my waste,” in which they worked with households, schools and 
government authorities on proper trash 
collection. In 2015, the second phase of that program resulted in 250 kilograms of plastic and 480 kilograms of paper being 
recycled in La Pila. 
Also in 2015, to bring more greenery to the 
community, Cummins employees trained local residents on reforestation methods and assisted in the planting of more than 
800 trees in La Pila. Cummins also worked 
with government authorities on a law to protect and conserve urban trees, ensuring the model’s long-term sustainability. It 
was approved by the San Luis Potosí 
government in July 2015.
As the company’s efforts branched out 
farther across La Pila, Cummins leaders   saw the need for a central structure to hold their neighborhood approach up – just like the lattice that will support Lopez’s 
tomato plant. In 2015, Cummins, the 
local government and other area partners established plans to open the La Pila Community Center where residents can 
come for support and fellowship.
“The Community Center will help others 
grow in their self-confidence, respect  for one another and commitment to  a stronger, healthier, safer La Pila,”  
said Juan Ulaje, a site manager for 
Cummins’ Filtration Business.
To that end, the Community Center  
will host classes for adults to complete 
their education, workforce trainings,  
a library, IT room and programs for arts  and crafts to beautify the neighborhood. The center won’t open until late 2016,  but Cummins employees already are 
engaged in its renovation, budget  
planning and program development.
Like Paloma Lopez’s plant and Arturo 
Jaramillo’s school, the Community Center 
is another seed in the garden that is La 
Pila. And by the fruits of their labor and Cummins’ neighborhood approach, they are feeding their community’s future.
THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD APPROACH
In 2016, Cummins employees are taking 
the company’s neighborhood approach in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, to communities 
around the world. 
Among Cummins’ North America sites, 
teams are replicating the La Pila strategy in Indianapolis, Indiana (U.S.A.); Fridley, 
Minnesota (U.S.A.); Charleston, South 
Carolina (U.S.A.) and Memphis,  Tennessee (U.S.A.).
Across the Atlantic, United Kingdom 
employees are exploring a neighborhood 
approach near their operations in 
Huddersfield. And in São Paulo, Brazil, Cummins leaders are engaging a neighborhood called Guarulhos,  
where they plan to align their adopt-
a-school program and Environmental Challenge projects to create greater  impact in the community. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

‘MODEL VILLAGES’ 
DELIVER HOPE
Five years ago, Banudas Sarak  
cultivated his barren farmland,  
producing a single crop just once a  
year. By 2015, his crops multiplied, 
yielding 12 months of work and an 
additional $8,000 in annual income. 
Sarak is one of many near Phaltan, India whose lives have improved  
significantly because of Cummins India’s “Model Villages” program.
“I am thankful to Cummins for showing the way,” Sarak said. “There is no looking back.”
When the Cummins India Megasite opened in 2011, it was equipped with all  
the latest technology. Nearby villages, however, lacked many of life’s basic needs,  
including water, hygiene, agriculture and education.
To address those needs, Cummins employees partnered with area residents shortly after 
the Cummins campus opened and, together, built a strategy for sustainable growth.
Model Villages started in Nandal, which receives an average of just two inches  
of rainfall per year. Such droughts led employees and villagers to create wells  
and a small barrier sometimes called a “check dam” to preserve monsoon rains. 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
84
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
They also developed drip-irrigation systems 
to water crops in a way that conserves water, and education classes to improve 
farming techniques. Sarak was one of the 
farmers who attended.
Three years later, Nandal has harvested 
43.6 million liters of water. Cummins India 
teams replicated the dams and wells in  
six more villages in 2015.
“Once, the villages around the Megasite 
were dependent on water tankers during summer, and today they are almost  
tanker-free,” said Sunil G. Bathe,  Cummins’ project leader for Model  
Villages. “Water availability has brought new meaning to farmers’ lives –  
a simple solution for a major crisis.”
Seven miles away in Mulikwadi, 30 percent 
of farmers live below the poverty line.  To aid their livelihoods, a check dam  
was completed in 2015, bringing higher  
water levels to eight wells and adding  70 more acres of cultivated farmland.  And just as in Nandal, Cummins  employees followed their agricultural 
assistance with education initiatives.Only 77 percent of children had attended 
school in Mulikwadi. To encourage  higher enrollment, in 2015, Cummins employees upgraded a nearby school’s 
roof and bathrooms and incorporated 
e-learning software with the government-approved curriculum.
Meanwhile, in the village of Manjarsumba, 
Cummins employees installed 45 biogas 
stations that run on cow manure, reducing deadly indoor air pollution from burning wood. In the Nimgaon Bogi village, two check dams were completed, harvesting 
about 3.6 million gallons of water.
Employees in Rajoda built on their 2014 
water efforts by constructing a pedestrian bridge to give village students a safer 
pathway to school. And in Karwasa in 
2015, Cummins’ village partnership  de-silted two ponds, resulting in the harvesting of 1.57 million gallons of water.
In 2016, those villages will continue the 
model launched in Nandal: moving their 
efforts indoors to schools, with a focus  on assisting teachers, incorporating  digital curriculum and supporting  
multi-lingual learning software.As for Nandal, the seed planted five  
years ago is bearing fruit throughout  the year. The village now has  300 additional acres of cultivatable  
land, near self-sufficiency in  
potable water and surplus income  to meet such basic needs as food  and shelter. The village also has  
been crime-free for the past  
three years.
By seeing that impact firsthand,  
Nandal’s villagers are today  leading their own water- 
management efforts and  
have persuaded the  government to contribute.  Now, they are the model,  
showing how villagers,  
including farmers like  Sarak, can turn a scarce  resource into a river  of opportunity.

In 2015, Cummins employees taught them a  
new skill set: how to create a safer work site.  
After conducting a Health, Safety and Environment 
assessment, employees designed a new workshop  
layout for the center, leveled and painted its floor and  
created separate areas for raw material storage.
“Historically, businesses would just provide the 
center with financial support,” said Salah Abousayed, 
Cummins Abu Dhabi Branch Manager. “But we 
developed a relationship with ZHO management and 
discovered our employees could offer knowledge and 
skills for something even greater.”
Cummins led ZHO instructors and students in

CUMMINS EXTENDS  
HELPING HAND TO 
STUDENTS IN AFRICA
When Abey Moleko enters the Afrika Tikkun Community Centre in South  
Africa, children excitedly slap hands with him, high-five style. Moleko and  
other Cummins employees are engaging those students now to help them  
realize that same joy when they enter their first jobs.
Recognizing the link between educational attainment and economic opportunity,  
Cummins’ Africa Distribution sites “adopt” underdeveloped schools to provide  
student mentoring, infrastructure support and career training. 
“Most students are raised in abject poverty and can’t even afford to further their  
studies,” said Moleko, the Community Involvement Team (CIT) Leader at Cummins 
Longmeadow South Africa. “Cummins employees saw they could close that gap by 
empowering students with basic skills to prepare them for the working world.”
Started in 2014 with five schools, employees adopted 11 more in 2015 and plan to 
reach a total of 20 in the years ahead. The positioning and diverse makeup of Cummins’ 
Distribution Business – with company-owned entities in 10 African countries – enable 
employees to tailor their services to the various needs of Africa’s schools and students.
Last year at the Afrika Tikkun Community Centre, for example, Moleko and his  
colleagues mentored students who were at risk of not graduating from the  
Kwabhekilanga and Reiger Park secondary schools. Employees provided  
the 92 teens career-readiness training and skills to secure entry-level jobs.Also in South Africa, Cummins employees 
managed the building and stocking of libraries at Clairwood High School and 
Edenridge Primary School, serving  
1,255 and 1,500 students, respectively. 
In Ghana’s Laterbiokorshie schools, 
employees led a similar library project while 
also bringing water to the schools. The 
absence of hygienic resources, including separate washrooms for girls, is a major factor in females’ abilities to attend school. 
“Education is very important as it helps 
promote gender equality,” said Mariam 
Salifu, a teacher at Laterbiokorshie.  “It is relieving to know that being educated has encouraged other girls to go against 
all odds and seek knowledge. In the end, 
education leads to growth of the family, society and country as a whole.”
 For both female and male students, 
eliminating hunger also can improve their educational opportunities. At the Manzini Primary School, the lack of food accessibility prompted employees to  
create a bio-gas system to fuel a school-
feeding program for impoverished  students – the project was a regional winner in Cummins’ 2015 Environmental 
Challenge. The school’s resulting savings 
from the reduced gas consumption will equal about $1,900 a year.
And at Kathu High School, Cummins’ 
South Africa employees developed a 
technical department and facilitated the 
incorporation of the government’s 2016 curriculum. With that infrastructure in  place, employees will lead a “training  technician program” to prepare students  for mechanical, mining and other engineering careers in local industries. 
In each of their adopted schools,  
Cummins employees have set a five-year 
goal to reach a 90 percent pass rate  
for students, 100 percent access to water and 100 percent retention among females.
“Cummins employees are privileged to 
work in needy communities to improve 
people’s lives,” Moleko said. “By changing the life of one person you have impacted positively the next generation, hence breaking the circle of poverty.”
It’s a high bar, but it’s one Abey Moleko  
is encouraging students to reach with  every high-five he gives.

PARTNERING

IMPACT
Karen Cecil is proof Cummins  
employees can have a “Big”  
impact on their communities.
When Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Indiana (U.S.A.) sought to improve  
its retention rate between mentors and mentees, Cummins’ Director of  
Global Environmental Sustainability wanted to help.
Starting in 2010, Cecil led two Community Impact Six Sigma projects that resulted in a 
significant increase in the organization’s retention rate. Her projects called for such steps  
as expanding mentor training to cover youth development and cultural competency.
The number of “Big-Little” relationships reaching their one-year anniversary  
increased from 59 percent to 78 percent after the projects’ recommendations  
were implemented – putting the Central Indiana organization among the 
 top-performing Big Brothers Big Sisters agencies in the United States.
Cecil was named the Big Brothers Big Sisters of  
Central Indiana 2015 “Volunteer of the Year.”“Karen’s passion and skills have brought 
added success to Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Indiana,” said Chief Program Officer Amy Pomeranz Essley. 
In 2014-2015, the organization facilitated 
1,147 matches with “Littles,” more than 86 percent of whom qualified for free or reduced-price lunches under federal anti-
poverty initiatives.Cecil found the most valuable contribution 
Cummins employees can make is working hand in hand with partners to define the real problem and not just the symptoms.
“We have the ability to bring 
about lasting, sustainable 
change in our communities,” 
Cecil said. “We just need to 
think big.”

TAKING HEALTH  
AND SAFETY TO  
THE NEXT LEVEL
Cummins saw improvements in  
several key safety metrics in 2015, 
including a 15 percent improvement  
in the Ergonomics Incidence Rate  
compared to a year earlier.The company, however, missed aggressive goals in several categories that  
Cummins leaders want to improve on in 2016.
“There was a lot of good news in 2015, but we set very aggressive targets  
because the stakes are so high – our employee’s health and well-being,”  
said Michelle Garner-Janna, Executive Director – Corporate Health & Safety. 
“Our workforce is becoming more actively engaged in preventing injuries  
and promoting healthy and safe behaviors,” she added. “There is always  
room for improvement, though, when it comes to protecting our most  
important asset, our employees.”
Highlights for 2015 included:
 »The 15 percent improvement in the Ergonomics  
Incidence Rate, the rate of ergonomics-related  
injuries per 100 employees, compared to 2014.
 »An 8 percent improvement in the Incidence Rate,  the relative number of recordable injuries and  
illnesses per 100 employees, compared  
to the previous year.
 »A 7 percent improvement in the Major  
Injury Rate, the rate of major injuries  
per 100 employees, compared to 2014. 
POWERING  
WHAT’S NEXT
As part of Corporate Health & Safety’s  
holistic approach, health leaders are  
also exploring the connection between  
personal health and safety.
Kelli Smith, Occupational Health Director,  
said Corporate Health & Safety has been  
working closely with Cummins Chief  
Medical Director Dr. Dexter Shurney and  
the company’s health benefits staff on  
initiatives such as Cummins’ LiveWell  
Center in Columbus, Indiana (USA).
The center, which opens in 2016,  
will be home to a number of physician and 
health related services, ranging from routine 
health and optometry exams to health 
coaching, classes on nutrition, acupuncture  
and chiropractic and physical therapy services.
The center will be available to all active 
employees, their spouses and dependents over 
the age of 2.
“We want our employees to arrive at work 
feeling 100 percent,” Smith said. “Something  
as simple as not getting enough sleep can 
affect how an employee performs and  
that can impact safety.”Rocky Myers, a Safety Engineer with Corporate Facilities 
at Cummins, plays a board game based on a Cummins health and safety training called “Live It. Lead It.”  with children visiting their parents’ workplace at Columbus Engine Plant in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.).  HEALTH & SAFETY

Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
SAFETY  
PERFORMANCE  INDICATORS
Here’s a look at key trends in  
safety at Cummins since 2011.The good news also included a 36 percent 
improvement in the Contractor Incidence Rate and a 13 percent improvement in  
monthly safety training hours, both 
compared to 2014.
There are some areas of concern. The 
Major Injury Rate, for example, declined 
compared to 2014 but was 86 percent 
over the company’s goal. Meanwhile, the Severity Case Rate, the number of injuries and illnesses resulting in lost work days  per 100 employees, was essentially  
unchanged compared to 2014,  
but nowhere near the significant  decrease leadership had set as a goal.
Lost Work Days increased slightly in 2015  
to 3,301 compared to 3,232 the previous 
year – a 2 percent gain. However, they are down 20 percent from the 4,154 lost days recorded in 2011, despite the company having a larger workforce in 2015.
The Incidence Rate, Severity Case  
Rate and the Ergo Incidence Rate  have all been on a consistent  downward trajectory since 2011.
 
  Over the past five years, the company  has stressed the importance of leaders  and employees becoming personally 
involved in safety and the need for 
everyone to look after their co-workers  in addition to themselves. 
In 2016, Corporate Health & Safety 
plans to implement a safety pledge card 
campaign to build on its previous efforts  to make safety personal. Employees  will be asked to sign a pledge to not  only look out for the safety of themselves 
but the safety of their co-workers, too.
The initiative will build on the roll out to 
employees in 2015 and 2016 of the  “Live It. Lead It.” training. The training 
started initially as a way to encourage 
leaders to take a personal interest in  safety. It proved so popular that leaders insisted it be offered to employees, too.
“We want everyone thinking about what 
motivates them to return home safely  
when their work day is over and what makes their colleagues want to do the same,” Garner-Janna said. “By making  
safety personal, I think we are naturally 
more likely to create a culture where we look for problems and fix them before incidents happen.” WORKPLACE

Seymour Technical Center in Seymour, 
Indiana (U.S.A.), a Cummins engineer 
fatally shot his manager and then  
himself. The company is deeply  
troubled and saddened by this event.
It will take time to recover.  
Employees who feel like they are 
having trouble coping or need to talk 
to someone are encouraged to take 
advantage of Cummins’ confidential 
Employee Assistance Program and  
other resources.
The company also wishes to thank 
all first responders at the technical 
center for their professionalism during 
this difficult event, including our own 
Emergency Response Team. They all 
displayed tremendous courage and 
compassion and their efforts are  
much appreciated. 
Cummins is committed to  
working together with our  
employees to move forward  
and become a stronger company.0.00.40.81.21.6Incidence Rate Indicator

BUILDING SAFE 
BEHAVIORS A 
BLOCK AT A TIME
It’s amazing how a game of Jenga  
can encourage safe behavior.
O.K., the “Live It. Lead It.” safety training for employees  
at Cummins involves a lot more than stacking blocks.  
But many participating employees say the class is doing  
more to promote safety than any training they’ve ever taken.
“The experience I had in the classroom was different than any 
training I’ve ever had,” said Debbie Liming, a Manufacturing  
Support Technician at the company’s Columbus Engine Plant (CEP) 
in Columbus, Indiana. “The leaders were open. They talked about 
situations they’d had here at work and also at home –  
which you never hear that at all.”
Stacy Workman-Wyatt, the Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)  
Leader at CEP , says the training makes safety personal while  
involving an element of team building and fun.

Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
“Live It. Lead It. is really a way of life,” said 
Workman-Wyatt, who was part of the team that put the employee training together.
“To live it means you will 
share your personal values 
by actively caring for others,” 
she said. “To lead it means 
when you witness an unsafe 
behavior or unsafe condition, 
you correct the issue or find 
someone who can.”
Live It. Lead It. started as a training  
for leaders to motivate them to take a personal interest in managing safety.  
They were asked to share their experiences 
with workplace injuries and the impact those injuries had on employees and their families. They were also asked to imagine 
how they might feel if their own family 
members were working at places in their plants, warehouses, laboratories or other locations with potential hazards.
The training was extremely popular and 
Cummins’ Corporate Health & Safety team 
decided to come up with a similar class for employees known as “Passport to Safety.”One of the first things a team of CEP  and Corporate Health & Safety leaders decided was the training should be led by someone who was supervising the employees participating in the class rather 
than a person from health and safety. 
They wanted to strengthen the relationship 
between managers and the employees they supervise as well as among the 
employees themselves, demonstrating  
that health and safety belongs to everyone, not just the Health & Safety function.
Participants play Jenga as they post notes 
with suggestions for improving safety. 
Falling towers symbolize barriers breaking 
down. Then it gets personal. Participants  are asked to return with pictures of  what motivates them to come home  
safely after work. The pictures are often  
of family members and the stories can  be very emotional.
“Employees often learn things they  
never knew about the people they  
work with,” Workman-Wyatt said.Stan Woszczynski, Vice President –  
Manufacturing and Supply Chain Management, attended one of the  trainings for hourly employees at Cummins. 
“The employees embraced the training 
by citing personal experiences and participating in the exercises,” he said.  “We all came away with a new outlook  
on staying safe.”The training encourages safety in all 
aspects of an employee’s life – at home and at work. Many sites have incorporated aspects of Live It. Lead It. into a game 
children can play when they visit their 
parents’ workplace.
“A safety mindset doesn’t end when  
you leave work,” Workman-Wyatt said.  
“It’s something you practice in every  
aspect of your life.”HEALTH & SAFETY

INDIA TEAM CLAIMS  
FIRST PLACE IN  
2015 ERGO CUP
Rotating the heavy crankshaft for additional life  
when a QSK-series engine arrived at the High  
Horsepower Master Rebuild Center in Phaltan,  
India used to be a physically demanding task.
The QSK-series includes the largest engines Cummins builds and the crankshaft, which delivers power from the engine to the  
wheels, can weigh thousands of pounds. Rotating it used to require three people: two to vigorously pull on a long bar attached  
to the crankshaft, and a third to look at the markings on the end of the crankshaft to signal when the pulling should stop.
It was not uncommon for the same two employees to have to push on the bar in the opposite direction if they happened to go too far. 
But now the task can be done with the flip of a switch. A team from the master rebuild center developed a mobile hydraulic  
pump to rotate the crankshaft, requiring just a single employee. The invention, which improves health, safety and productivity,  
won first place in Cummins’ fourth annual Ergo Cup competition in 2015.
“It’s exciting to see such a risky task made safe by an organic solution,” said Chris Shieldsmith, Global Ergonomics  
Leader at Cummins and the Ergo Cup Competition judge. “The gains in efficiency and productivity are great,  
but employee safety and risk reduction is most important. This project addresses all of these issues.” The crankshaft project topped a record-
setting 96 entries from around the 
company. In previous years, first-place 
honors were awarded to a torque-reduction tool from Jamestown, New York (USA) in 2014, a part installation 
improvement process from Jamestown 
in 2013 and a power generation hoist improvement from one of the company’s joint ventures in China in 2012. 
Team members Malhari Gaikwad, Kiran 
Shinde, Umesh Inamke and Rajendra  
Kajarekar used Cummins’ standard ergonomics analysis tool, The Humantech System, to help design the solution.  
The tool is able to identify the risks  
and hypothesize potential solutions.  They eventually settled on a new device that would not only eliminate the physical risk factors, but also markedly improve 
overall productivity and efficiency.The mobile unit is powered by a hydraulic motor that easily mounts on the QSK-
series engine where the starter would typically go. With the new setup, only one employee is required to perform the task. The crankshaft turns slowly and the 
operator can visually identify when it is in 
the correct location. 
In addition to the ease of use and reduction 
of risk, the overall time to complete the  
task is cut by 16 minutes. Employees are 
thrilled with the new solution, as a single  person can now complete the job. 
The invention is being shared across  
the company with any business unit  
that comes in contact with high 
horsepower engines.
“The entries in the Ergo Cup just  
keep becoming more interesting  
and more impactful,” Shieldsmith said.  
“I’m continually impressed by the ingenuity our employees bring to their job every day.”
The winning Ergo Cup team figured  
a way to safely turn the heavy  crankshaft of a high horsepower  engine for remanufacturing.HEALTH & SAFETY

DIVERSITY
TAKING ACTION 
TO PRESERVE CUMMINS’ DIVERSITY VALUE
Diversity is at work every day, in every 
location, at every level of Cummins. 
Early on, Cummins’ leaders understood that harnessing the  
power of diversity could set the company apart from its  
competitors. That vision helped shape Cummins into  
what it is today: a company striving to be a place where  employees feel safe and welcome to share their ideas  
and make innovation come alive.
The past 12 months included an increased focus on  
inclusion and embracing both visible and invisible  
diversity through a series of initiatives. 
108
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
FIGHTING 
DISCRIMINATION
With diversity related issues taking center 
stage in news coverage around the world in 2015, Cummins joined the conversation 
through a series of focus groups, town 
halls, opinion pieces and other events to promote the company’s Diversity value.
When anti-Muslim rhetoric in world media 
increased, Cummins used the controversy 
to reinforce its commitment to diversity  and inclusion. In June of 2015, Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger hosted a series of focus groups with Muslim employees  
to better understand the issues they  
faced and to learn what Cummins  could do to create a more welcoming atmosphere both at work and in the 
communities in which employees live. 
Linebarger encouraged all employees to 
reflect on their commitment as individuals to live Cummins’ values and create environments where everyone has the 
opportunity to succeed and be treated  
with dignity and respect. 
He also wrote an opinion piece that 
appeared in several publications in the 
United States in January 2016.“Discrimination and intolerance have no 
place in our company, in our communities or in our country,” he wrote. “Today, divisive rhetoric that isolates minority 
groups is undermining our ability to see the 
commonalities we share and inhibiting our efforts to improve our communities.
“It is wrong to use fear of those who are 
different to further enshrine discrimination 
against individuals for political purposes,” 
he added, citing not only anti-Muslim rhetoric but rhetoric targeting lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender (LGBT) 
individuals and African Americans.
GROWING 
DIVERSITY
In 2015, Cummins also increased  
its focus on regional diversity initiatives.  In the Middle East, for example, the  
Area Business Organization looked  
at ways it could increase the number  of women in its workforce. 
In the U.S., meanwhile, the company 
increased its efforts to recruit, develop  
and retain Blacks, African Americans, Latinos and Hispanics. The company increased its participation and engagement in recruiting efforts through conferences such as the National 
Society of Black Engineers and onsite 
networking at colleges and universities around the country. Cummins also paid close attention to advancement opportunities and retention of current 
employees and identified ways to  
improve both. 
In addition, Cummins joined more than  
1,100 companies from around the  
world in signing the Women’s 
Empowerment Principles (http://weprinciples.org/). By signing the principles, Cummins pledged its commitment to diversity and a  
gender-balanced workforce. 
Developed through a collaboration 
between the United Nations Entity  for Gender Equality and the  
Empowerment of Women and the  
U.N. Global Compact, the seven  principles emphasize the business  case for corporate action to  promote gender equality and  
women's empowerment.POWERING  
WHAT’S NEXT
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
The upcoming year will focus  
on two key issues: unconscious  
bias and language barriers. 
As a global company with employees 
in every time zone, speaking many 
languages, communicating effectively is 
critical. The Chairman’s Diversity Council, 
consisting of top leaders at Cummins, 
identified the need to better inform and 
equip employees with the resources 
necessary to remove language barriers.
Unconscious bias refers to a bias that 
people may be unaware of. Unchecked, 
however, it can interfere with people's 
ability to be fully inclusive. Cummins will 
seek to educate managers and employees 
about this bias and how to interupt it.DIVERSITY
INVESTIGATING 
COMPLAINTS
A key part of creating the right 
environment for success is the ability to investigate complaints made about 
employees’ treatment of each other.
Cummins’ Diversity value is part of the 
company’s Code of Conduct. Cummins has Master Investigators around the 
world to look into reported abuses of 
the code. Employees can file complaints anonymously where allowed by law.
The company investigated  
1,851 reported code violations in  
2015, up from 1,559 in 2014. About  
45 percent came from outside the U.S. in 2015, about the same as in 2014, and 33 percent were reported anonymously, 
also about the same as 2014.
About 58 percent of the total reports 
were ultimately substantiated in 2015, compared to 48 percent in 2014.  About 28 percent of the substantiated 
reports resulted in terminations 
compared to 29 percent in 2014.
The average time to close a case was  
14 work days, down one day from 2014.

at different locations around the world.
LIVING OUR  
DIVERSITY VALUE
When Sharon Barner took over the Cummins’ Law  
Department in early 2012, she began requiring that the  
outside law firms working for the company show  
they shared Cummins’ Diversity value.
In going from about 150 outside firms down to 22, she began  
to score them on certain diversity metrics such as whether they  
had a diverse relationship partner heading up Cummins’ file,  
or for the number of hours diverse lawyers spent  
on the company’s business.
In dealings with outside law firms, Barner says the number  
of minority leadership partners – lawyers who are a firm’s primary  
contact with Cummins – has risen from zero to four. Meanwhile,  
the number of female leadership partners has increased from one  
to three. She estimates about 50 percent of the hours worked  
on company matters by outside firms are now done by  
diverse lawyers and women.
“As a law firm, you can decide whether you want to help me focus  
on diversity as one of my issues or not,” Barner told Bloomberg’s  
Big Law Business. “I don’t make you stay on the preferred list, but  
if you’re going to be on it, here are the things that we value,  
both from the legal function and as a company as a whole.”DIVERSITY

BREAKING  
BARRIERS TO 
FLY IN SPACE
Nothing was going to stop Franklin 
Chang Díaz from realizing his dream. 
Not language barriers. Not financial 
barriers. And certainly not the hard work 
necessary to become an astronaut.Chang Díaz, however, also says he 
was also fortunate to have a loving and supportive family and some well-timed  
help along the way.
“No one gets anywhere without someone 
else’s help,” Chang Díaz said as the featured speaker at a diversity forum in 
October 2015 called “Breaking Barriers,” 
sponsored by the Southern Indiana (U.S.A.) Local Diversity Council at Cummins.
Over his 25-year career at NASA (National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration), 
Chang Díaz went into space seven times 
on the Space Shuttle and performed three 
space walks as part of the construction of the International Space Station. 
A native of Costa Rica who is also a U.S. 
citizen, Chang Díaz is today Chairman and CEO of the Ad Astra Rocket Company based in Houston, Texas, which is working on a new space propulsion system. Chang 
Díaz is also a member of the Cummins 
Board of Directors, serving in that capacity since 2009.
His dream of space travel started at an 
early age. When he was seven, Chang Díaz 
remembers vividly his mother telling him about Sputnik, the first satellite to orbit the earth on Oct. 4, 1957. He looked intently for a moving star in the night sky. “I never 
saw it,” he said, “but I saw it in my mind.”
The first person to help him realize his 
dream, beside his parents, would be noted rocket scientist Dr. Wernher von Braun, 
albeit in a most unusual way. Chang Díaz 
wrote von Braun, who was leading NASA then. Someone in the space agency  wrote back. While the letter was positive,  it cautioned Chang Díaz that he needed  
to be an American citizen to become a 
NASA astronaut.
Even though he didn’t speak English and 
had to have the letter translated, Chang 
Díaz interpreted it as an invitation to the 
United States. In 1968, he flew to the U.S., joining relatives in Hartford, Connecticut. 
After nearly flunking out of high school, 
Chang Díaz started to master English  
and school counselors tried to guide  
him to a community college. A friendly teacher told him he needed to go to a  four-year school to realize his dream. 
Chang Díaz won a scholarship to the 
University of Connecticut. School officials, however, initially thought he was from the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico – not Costa Rica. They told him the 
scholarship was only for U.S. citizens,  
but the Connecticut legislature passed special legislation exempting him from  that requirement for one year.
With his foot in the door, Chang Díaz 
won other scholarships to cover his undergraduate studies. He then attended graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), earning a 
Doctorate in Applied Plasma Physics.  
He also obtained his U.S. citizenship.
The first time he applied to NASA’s 
astronaut selection program, Chang  
Díaz was turned down. He applied again, 
one of more than 3,000 applicants for  19 positions. This time, Chang Díaz  made it, and began training in 1980. 
Six years later, Chang Díaz’s dream  
came true. On Jan. 12, 1986, he was  
part of a mission aboard the Space  Shuttle Columbia.

DEVELOPING A 
TRULY GLOBAL 
WORKFORCE
Diversity at Cummins has long been about more than representation. But as a truly  
global company, Cummins wants to develop a workforce that closely resembles the  
demographics in the countries and markets where it does business.
Company leaders pay special attention to some key metrics of under-represented  
groups at Cummins, such as women. An employee’s country of birth is another  
key metric to ensure leadership isn’t limited to one country or group of countries.

Cummins for a second year in a row  
topped $1 billion in business with diverse  
suppliers across eight categories in 
the U.S. in 2015 despite a challenging 
economy the last half of the year.
“Our purchasing function, working with our business units, did a really good job looking 
for opportunities to do business with diverse and small business suppliers in 2015,” said 
Diversity Procurement Director Michelle Taylor. “Reaching $1 billion again in 2016 will be a 
challenge, but I’m excited about the opportunity to do even more.”
In 2015, Cummins reached $1.3 billion in spending with diverse and small business

The company’s diversity procurement 
efforts outside the United States also continued to grow. Diverse procurement 
connected to Cummins Area Business  
Organizations (ABOs) reached $320 million compared to $291 million in 2014, pushing global spending with diverse suppliers to 
more than $1.6 billion in 2015. 
By working with diverse suppliers, 
Cummins increases competition for its business, which ultimately decreases costs and improves service. At the same 
time, diversity procurement develops 
economic growth in all of the communities where Cummins employees live and work, keeping with the company’s Corporate 
Responsibility value to “serve and improve 
the communities in which we live.”
The company participated in a number 
of diversity procurement events around the United States ranging from the 
2015 National Gay & Lesbian Chamber 
of Commerce Business Matchmaker held in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce 
convention in Houston, Texas.At the Houston event, Cummins was 
inducted into the Hispanic chamber’s “Million Dollar Club,” which recognizes 
corporations reaching $50 million in 
spending with Hispanic-owned companies. 
Outside the U.S., the company attended 
the seventh annual Minority Supplier 
Development China Summit in Beijing, and 
took steps to launch diversity procurement initiatives in Germany, Romania and Turkey.
The diversity procurement team (http://
supplierdiversity.cummins.com/) also 
took on a number of initiatives designed 
to partner with organizations that drive diversity procurement education within  their supply chain programs. 
Cummins, for example, partnered 
with Howard University, a historically black college located in Washington, D.C. Howard leads the Supply Chain Advisory Council, which is comprised of 
several chief procurement officers from 
corporations such as GM, Dupont and Toyota committed to developing strong supply chain student leaders at  
the school. Lisa Yoder, Vice President – Global Supply 
Chain and Manufacturing, will represent 
Cummins on the council and Sharon 
Barner, Vice President – General Counsel, is the Executive Sponsor for Cummins-Howard University recruitment team. 
Looking ahead, Taylor says she wants to 
explore in 2016 whether there are diversity procurement opportunities at Cummins in professional services such as lease management, insurance, legal and  
facility maintenance.
“We really need to explore every  
possibility to sustain and exceed our  $1 billion efforts in 2016,” she said.DIVERSE

PASSING 
THE BATON 
TO A NEW 
MAESTRO
When the company’s technical  
leaders from across the globe  
gathered in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.)  
for their annual fall conference in 2015, 
the meeting was especially poignant.  
In many ways, it signified a passing  
of the baton from Dr. John Wall to  
Jennifer Rumsey, Cummins’ new 
 Chief Technical Officer (CTO). 
Wall announced his retirement from that post just three months earlier,  
ending an illustrious career spanning nearly 30 years with the company.  
During his 15 years as Cummins’ CTO, Wall elevated the company’s  
standing as an industry leader in technology.Much as he had inherited Cummins’ long-
held reputation for technical innovation, a reputation dating back to Cummins’ Founder Clessie Cummins, Wall passed its future care into Rumsey’s capable hands.
A Cummins employee since 2000, most 
recently as the engineering leader of the Engine Business Unit, Rumsey used the conference to unveil her vision for the 
technical organization, which includes most 
of the company’s nearly 10,000 engineers.
That vision included some key themes  
from the Wall era, but also a new beginning. Challenging global market 
conditions helped drive clarity around 
several changes, she said, leaving the technical organization at a crossroads.
Approaching near-zero 
levels in developed markets, 
emission regulations on 
oxides of nitrogen (NOx)  
and particulate matter (PM), 
while still important, would  
no longer drive innovation  
as they have for the past 
decade and a half,  
Rumsey said.
 Cummins must continue meeting 
increasingly stringent NOx and PM regulations in both mature markets  
such as the U.S. and Europe and 
developing countries like China  and India. But Rumsey said the next  phase of innovation will increasingly 
depend on a deep knowledge of  
the company’s customers and how Cummins can enable their success.
That includes a growing focus  
on fuel efficiency to reduce the 
environmental impact of Cummins’ 
products while delivering value to  the company’s customers.
At a time when established  
business models are  
increasingly disrupted  by innovative outsiders,  Rumsey told the leaders  at the conference,  
“We have to be positioned  
to disrupt ourselves.”
 A REMARKABLE  
LEADER RETIRES
It’s hard to overstate the impact former Chief  
Technical Officer John Wall had on Cummins  
and the diesel industry over the past quarter  
century before he retired in 2015. 
Electronic high pressure fuel systems, cooled  
exhaust gas recirculation, wall-flow diesel  
particulate filters, selective catalytic reduction  
and NOx aftertreatment – Dr. Wall played a  
significant role in these breakthrough clean-air  
technologies and more during his illustrious career.
A champion of the environment, Dr. Wall helped  
Cummins partner with the Environmental Protection  
Agency and was at the center of many pivotal  
moments and initiatives in the company’s history.
His lasting legacy, however, may be his mentorship  
and commitment to the personal development of the 
employees of the technical organization, which will help 
ensure innovative leadership at Cummins for years to come.

disruption through a continued investment in research and development despite 
challenging economic conditions.  
The company devoted more $700 million to research and development expenses  for a fourth consecutive year in 2015, 
investing $735 million. 
 
   The company continued its research and development focus on both improving current technologies to meet future emissions and customer requirements 
around the world as well as developing 
critical future technologies. Cummins’ Advanced Engineering and Technology organization, for example, looks out  six to 10 years, and sometimes longer,  
well upstream of product development. 
This work is critical. An estimated  
70 percent of a product’s environmental impacts are determined during the

121INNOVATIONHere’s what she has to say about her new job,  
her predecessor and why she chose to build 
a career at Cummins:
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO FILL  
THE ROLE OF YOUR MENTOR  
AND FRIEND, JOHN WALL? 
John Wall had a major role in transforming Cummins 
products and emission technology in our industry.  
I intend to build on his legacy and develop that next 
generation of breakthrough innovations. We are  focused on creating an environment where our  
global technical organization can work together  
to solve some of the world’s biggest challenges.QQWHY HAS 
CUMMINS’ TECHNICAL  ORGANIZATION BEEN SUCCESSFUL?
Our ability to identify the 
right technology to meet the 
emissions challenges and to 
integrate those technologies into products that meet our 
customers’ needs has set  
us apart from the competition. Meeting emissions regulations 
will only grow in importance 
globally in the future, but  we anticipate it will no longer 
drive innovation and business 
growth in the same way it  has historically.QQWHAT’S NEXT FOR CUMMINS?
Our next phase of success will be characterized by  our ability to deliver differentiated products, information  
and technologies that wow and delight our customers.  
I believe two key ingredients drive success in innovation. The first ingredient is an understanding of and openness 
to technology changes and how new technologies and 
technical ideas may develop into innovative products. 
The second ingredient is a problem or opportunity  
which demands a new technology or new application  
of an existing technology. To define these problems  and opportunities requires a deep understanding  
of our customers, of their needs and what’s  
important to them, and of how we can use  technology and advances in our products  
to enable our customers’ success.QQ
WHY HAVE YOU CHOSEN  
TO BUILD YOUR CAREER  AT CUMMINS? 
This is my dream job. I found a passion for research and 
development as an intern at Cummins. My work matters  
for the environment and for our customers. I like solving 
problems, but I really like developing solutions that will  have an immediate positive and large-scale impact.QQ

WITH PERR 
INNOVATION  
AWARD
The Julius P . Perr Innovation Award is presented annually to Cummins employees  
for their contributions to significant technological advances benefiting the company.  
In 2015, 14 scientists and engineers were honored for developing critical,  
robust solutions to reduce diesel emissions for challenging engine duty cycles. “These inventors and their 
novel ways of approaching 
and solving problems have 
added to the Cummins  
legacy of innovation and 
technology leadership,”  
said Rich Freeland,  
President and Chief  
Operating Officer at  
Cummins. “Dr. Perr’s 
commitment to this legacy 
and to the success of our customers helped us  
become a market leader.” Here’s a look at the 2015 winners:
THERMAL MANAGEMENT OF  
DIESEL PARTICULATE FILTERS
The ability to control exhaust temperatures 
within a desired temperature window has 
been a daunting challenge facing engine 
manufacturers. Cummins’ engineers Linsong Guo, Tim Frazier and Morgan Andreae developed variable geometry turbocharger and fuel injection strategies  
to control aftertreatment temperatures 
while optimizing fuel consumption and avoiding damaging engine conditions. CONTROLLING DIESEL ENGINE 
EXHAUST TEMPERATURES
Emissions reductions and associated 
aftertreatment systems required significantly improved controls compared to previous diesel engine control strategies. 
Jennifer Rumsey and Tom Dollmeyer were 
able to improve diesel fuel economy and reliability through their approach which used inverted virtual sensor technology. 
Dan Baker, Steve Bellinger, Melissa Dye, 
John Mulloy, Pat Shook, Joan Wills 
and Steve Wills were honored for their contributions to develop robust and effective diesel particulate filter regeneration 
strategies. These technologies improved 
diesel fuel economy while assuring that  the optimum particulate filter cleaning  was obtained at the proper time.
PREVENTION OF CARBON  
DEPOSITS ON AFTERTREATMENT 
Carbon deposits can build up on the front 
surfaces of catalysts in diesel exhaust 
sometimes referred to as “face-plugging.” Conrad Simon and Tom Yonushonis were honored for the development of a novel inlet surface coating that aided in the 
removal of deposits at low temperature 
exhaust conditions. ABOUT

123USING THE POWER 
OF NUMBERS TO REDUCE CO
2
Kevin Brittain started getting into efficient 
design while an engineering undergrad  at the University of Evansville in Evansville, Indiana (U.S.A.). It wasn’t  until he came to Cummins, however, that he fully appreciated the connection between design efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide (CO
2).
Using sophisticated computer software, Brittain looks for ways to design high horsepower 
engines for trains, ships, large generators and more, so they make the most efficient use  of raw materials without impacting the durability and dependability customers rely on. 
“We all have a  
role to play in  
achieving our  
mission that  
everything we do  
leads to a cleaner, 
healthier, safer 
environment.  
This is one way that  
our engineers can  
make an impact.” 
KEVIN BRITTAIN
Applied Mechanics Engineer – Technical SpecialistINNOVATION
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
124INNOVATION
The team he works on, the High Horsepower Structural Analysis Team, has discovered 
ways to remove hundreds of pounds from high horsepower products, which can mean better fuel efficiency for customers while also reducing the need to mine additional raw 
materials. Better fuel efficiency reduces carbon dioxide (CO
2), the primary greenhouse  
gas emitted through human activities.
“We all have a role to play in achieving our mission that everything we do leads to  
a cleaner, healthier, safer environment,” said Brittain, who is based at Cummins’  
new high horsepower technical center in Seymour, Indiana. “This is one way that  our engineers can make an impact.”
Brittain, an Applied Mechanics Engineer – Technical Specialist, relies on the power  
of numbers to do his job. He leads a global council within the company on something 
called Numerical Optimization, the use 
of mathematical calculations and related approaches to help engineers arrive at “better designs, faster.” 
He joined Cummins about five years ago 
because he thought it offered the best opportunity to practice the subject of his master’s thesis at the University of Illinois, 
Topology Optimization, a major subset of 
Numerical Optimization at the company.
Brittain knew of Cummins’ reputation  
in engineering circles for Analysis Led Design, the use of powerful computer 
models to simulate, in this case,  
 the harsh environment inside an  
engine and how the engine works in  
real-world applications. Analysis Led Design allows engineers to test an  almost limitless number of design  variables before an engine ever  
uses a drop of fuel in a test cell. 
Numerical Optimization makes Analysis 
Led Design more efficient by helping engineers choose the design elements 
most likely to succeed from those 
limitless options, significantly reducing design time. Brittain, for example, uses Topology Optimization to help determine where material needs to stay to maintain 
robustness and where it can be removed 
without affecting durability.
Any design, of course, will be tested 
extensively in a test cell to make sure it 
delivers under real-world conditions before 
it goes to the customer. But the chances for success are greatly enhanced by all  the work that goes into that final design.
“Cummins is fortunate to have many 
engineers like Kevin who are helping the 
company reduce its carbon footprint in a   way that gives our customers the power 
they need to succeed,” said Madeleine 
Fogler, who led Cummins’ Design for Environment initiative until taking a new post at the company early in 2016.
 
Brittain says he loves working  on Cummins’ High Horsepower  
Structural Analysis Team.
“Our team is young, diverse and embraces 
new ideas and new methods,” he said. “We have members in the U.S., the U.K. and India and everyone has a passion for 
finding new ways to improve our products.”
“The focus of Design for 
Environment is to reduce  
our product’s environmental 
impact by making informed 
decisions in the design  
phase,” she added.  
“Reducing material without 
compromising durability  
and reliability is one way  
to do that.”The High Horsepower Structural 
Analysis Team has discovered ways 
to remove hundreds of pounds from 
high horsepower products, which 
can mean better fuel efficiency for 
customers while also reducing the 
need to mine additional raw materials.

STOP-START  
TECHNOLOGY  
TO WORK FOR 
STANDARD  
BUSES
Stop-start technology has been used in European cars dating  
back to the 1980s, and some say even longer. How hard could  
it be to bring the technology to standard buses, right?
Cummins engineers Bill Cross and Bill Lamb have had it in their  
own cars for years and both say that experience helped them as part of the  
Cummins team bringing stop-start technology to standard buses in 2015.
They point out, however, that starting and stopping a bus engine requires a lot more  
torque than an automobile engine. Also, a London bus makes up to 50 stops per hour. 
Over a 16-hour daily usage period, that comes to about 800 stops per day for a  
single bus, 5,000 stops per week and 20,000 stops per month.
INNOVATION
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
126“The stops alone made by a standard 
bus without this technology really tests the engine over time,” said Cross, HMLD 
System Teams Technical Project Leader at 
Cummins’ Darlington Engine Plant in the United Kingdom. “When you are turning the engine off, then restarting it, the wear 
and tear is that much greater.”Cummins unveiled in 2015 a new system 
for its ISB engines that brings the fuel economy benefits of stop-start technology 
to conventional buses. The technology, 
which saves fuel by shutting down the engine when a vehicle is at rest, had only previously been available on far more 
expensive diesel-electric hybrid buses.The system for standard bus engines 
developed by Cummins engineers  includes an upgraded starter motor 
capable of over 180,000 starts.  
Endurance tests show that more than 210,000 starts without a failure is possible.
“We have developed a system that 
delivers 4 to 7 percent fuel savings without 
significant operator investment needed and meets the durability requirements of city bus duty cycles,” said Kartik Ramanan, General Manager of Cummins Global Bus 
Engine segment, speaking at the 2015 
Busworld Kontrijk, the preeminent bus trade show in Europe held every two years.
In addition to a more capable starter 
motor, hardware updates to the ISB Euro 
6 engines include a new flywheel ring gear, new wiring, a new engine speed sensor,  an updated fuel system and new crankshaft bearings. 
Lamb, HMLD Systems Engineering  
Leader, points out the challenges go beyond merely starting and restarting  the engine thousands of times to  
improve fuel efficiency.
 The typical bus, for example, takes  
1.5 seconds to get up to speed but because of traffic conditions in London, 
bus drivers typically have only 0.6 to 0.8 
seconds to safely pull away from the curb.
“There’s a lot happening when a bus 
comes to a stop,” Lamb said. “It all has to  
be taken into account in designing a stop-
start system that gets it back up to speed.”
The ISB engine software has been upgraded 
to manage the technology and provide flexible system architecture, enabling 
customers to tailor it to their operations.
Cummins’ launch fleet of 100 buses went 
into service in the fourth quarter of 2015. The fleet’s performance will be closely 
monitored to ensure the new system is 
achieving its expected savings. 
Lamb and Cross say the project is truly  
an example of Cummins’ global reach,  with engineers in the U.S. and U.K.  
playing critical roles since development 
started in 2011.
“I really believe this could be important 
globally as transit systems look for  
ways to reduce their carbon footprint  
and save money on fuel,” Lamb said.
HOW IT WORKS
Stop-start technology saves  
fuel by shutting off the engine  
when the bus is stopped.  
Here's a quick explanation  of how it works:
 »When the bus comes to a stop,  
fuel flow is cut off and the engine  cuts off, saving fuel.
 »Other bus systems – lights,  ventilation fans, etc. – remain on.
 »When a driver releases  the park brake, the engine  
automatically restarts within  
a fraction of a second —  before the foot even reaches  the acceleration pedal.INNOVATION

127PROMOTING STEM 
AT A FORMER SUPERFUND SITE
Editor’s note: Innovation at Cummins isn’t limited to the company’s 
 products and processes. Here’s an example of one employee’s  
creativity in helping build a stronger community.
Where others saw a decaying, 2,400-acre ammunition plant,  
closed for nearly 40 years, Cummins’ Prad Pathirana saw  
an opportunity to introduce STEM – science, technology,  
engineering and math – to public school students.
And that’s precisely what’s happening now after the  
former plant, near Cummins Power Systems in Fridley,  
Minnesota (USA), was removed in 2015 from the  Superfund list of the worst environmental sites  
in the United States.
Working with Pathirana and other Cummins employees,  
the Mounds View Public School District has turned the  
vacant space into a real-world, outdoor classroom,  
where students are performing environmental studies  as public officials redevelop the former Twin Cities  
Army Ammunition Plant built in 1941. INNOVATION
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
128“It took Prad getting on board to  
push that into high gear and to look  into other ways of getting involved in  
our district,” said Mindy Handberg, 
Executive Director of the Mounds  View Schools Education Foundation.
KEEPING  
THINGS MOVING
Pathirana kept the project moving forward 
with tasks, timelines and status meetings. Lab equipment fills the portable classroom 
trailer thanks to a grant from the Cummins 
Foundation that Pathirana pursued.
He engaged his co-workers along the way:  
Safety professionals performed a safety 
audit, and the sales team at nearby 
distributor Cummins NPower sized the trailer’s generator set. A group of employees volunteered to ready the  trailer for students.
For Pathirana, the trailer represents  
the latest milestone since he joined  the company’s Community Involvement Team four years ago, intent on building  
a relationship with the school district.
 
 “I wanted to start small and do something that you could build up to,” said Pathirana, an Aftermarket VPI Lead for Cummins Power Generation.
He says it has been a team effort, crediting 
both school officials and his fellow employees. Pathirana and his co-workers ramped up activities with the district to get Cummins employees working alongside 
students, ranging from judging science 
fairs to building a LEGO model of a Cummins engine to starting a high school internship program. 
During one meeting with school officials, 
Pathirana challenged district leaders to think about an environmental problem they could tackle together with the CIT, capitalizing on their mutual appetites  
STEM education.
The outdoor classroom project was 
born. It was a natural fit for Cummins. Nestled between Power Generation’s 
manufacturing plant in Fridley and its  
global headquarters in Shoreview,  the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant  was a staple in the community with  26,000 workers at peak production. 
 The plant closed in 1976 and was 
designated a U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund  site a few years later.
GETTING YOUTH 
INVOLVED
Developers want to include youth 
perspectives as they plan the commercial, retail, residential and green spaces they 
hope to develop at the site. Pathirana said 
that was critical to developing the outdoor classroom idea.
“Looking to the future, the site evolution 
into residential and urban development 
will provide multiple learning opportunities, where the students can feel like they  are part of the plan,” Pathirana said.  “This line of thinking is where we really 
came up with the outdoor classroom idea.” 
More than 400 students have engaged  
in activities at the site during the  2015-16 school year, but Mounds  
View Science Coach Shane Wood  
said much more can be done.
“We haven’t come close to realizing all  
of the possibilities out there,” he said.
Here’s a look at student  
activity at the site in the  
2015-2016 academic year:
MORE THAN 
450 STUDENTS 
have been on site from two high  
schools and three middle schools.

129PREPARING  
FOR BETTER MARKETS AHEAD
Cummins operates in cyclical markets 
around the world and inevitably the business faces periods of weak  demand and reduced short-term earnings when global economic  growth slows.
Due to the company’s financial strength, Cummins has been able to continue  
investing for future growth through tough economic times, emerging from the  past two downturns with significantly improved financial performance and  
a stronger competitive position in a number of important markets.
Despite a challenging global economy in 2015, Cummins invested more  
than $1.6 billion in capital, acquisitions, joint ventures and research and  development in 2015 to position the company for future profitable  
growth when markets improve.
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
130FINANCEThe company, for example, acquired three 
more of its distributors in North America in 2015, for a total of 10 distributor 
acquisitions over the past two years. 
Owning these distributors will enable Cummins to provide better customer service regardless of product type, 
ultimately driving more growth in key  
end markets in the long run.
During the acquisition process, the 
company successfully integrated more than 9,000 employees from the distributors 
it acquired without disrupting service and 
support to Cummins customers.
“We made significant progress in a number 
of our key initiatives in 2015, including 
gaining market share with our new 
products in China, successfully acquiring and integrating our North American distributors, improving the quality of our products and reducing material costs,”  
said Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger.
“However, a combination of weaker 
end markets and a stronger U.S. dollar presented significant challenges to our 
performance,” Linebarger said. “As 
demand slowed in the third quarter (of 2015), we moved quickly to lower costs.”REPOSITIONING 
FOR THE FUTURE
Fourth quarter revenues of $4.8 billion 
were down 6 percent compared to the same quarter in 2014, leading Cummins 
to reduce its workforce by about 
2,000 positions through a combination of targeted restructuring and other staffing actions. The company also 
launched a number of initiatives within its 
manufacturing operations to reduce costs.
Cummins, for example, announced in 
February 2016 it would be reorganizing its manufacturing operations for power 
generation equipment, relocating over the 
next two years its generator set assembly operations from Kent in the United Kingdom, to Daventry in the U.K., Phaltan, 
India and Wuhan, China. The Kent site will 
be transformed into an important regional distribution and logistics center.
“The benefits of restructuring, material 
cost reduction initiatives and quality 
improvements combined with the launch 
of new and improved products in 2016 should position the company for stronger performance in the future despite the  
 challenges of a weak macroeconomic 
environment,” Linebarger said.
Revenue for all of 2015 was $19.1 billion, 
1 percent lower than in 2014. Sales 
increased 7 percent in North America,  
but international revenue declined  11 percent due to lower sales in Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific.
Net income attributable to Cummins  
for the full year in 2015 was $1.40 billion 
($7.84 per diluted share), or $1.59 billion ($8.93 per diluted share) excluding  asset impairment charges and  
restructuring actions.
The company, however, generated 
operating cash flow of more than  $2 billion in 2015, the third straight  year above $2 billion, helping Cummins  
maintain an “A” credit rating from  
all three major credit rating agencies.
In April 2016, Cummins consolidated  
its high horsepower engine business  
with its power generation business. 
The two already had an interdependent relationship, with high horsepower providing many of the engines used  in the company’s generators. The new Cummins Power Systems will be more agile, streamlining the engineering process and capitalizing on the company’s 
scale advantage in supply chain and 
manufacturing to be faster to market  and more cost competitive.
The company also centralized many 
of its customer service functions, and 
much of its product marketing to improve performance while finding efficiencies. 
UP TO THE 
CHALLENGE
Linebarger said all the moves in 2015 
and early 2016 will leave Cummins well positioned for future success. It will take 
time, however, for markets to improve and 
finding greater efficiencies will continue to be important to the company throughout 2016. 
“With a leaner cost structure and 
strengthened product and market positions, 
I’m confident Cummins will emerge as a stronger company when better markets return,” Linebarger said, ”just as we have done following the last two downturns.”

record $1.5 billion or 74 percent  
of operating cash flow to  
shareholders by increasing the 
dividend per share 25 percent and 
repurchasing 7.2 million shares.
 This compared to $1.2 billion, or  
52 percent of operating cash flow  
in 2014. In addition, Cummins Board 
of Directors approved a new $1 billion 
dollar share repurchase program in 
November of 2015.

EMPLOYEES  
TOWARD ETHICAL  
BEHAVIOR
The company’s Ethics & Compliance 
team plays a critical role in Cummins’ 
sustainability, helping employees live the 
company’s Integrity value, to “do what is 
right and what we say we will do.”
In 2015, Ethics & Compliance guided employees in many ways, ranging from  
reviewing the processes Cummins uses to screen suppliers at risk of violating  
the company’s Supplier Code of Conduct to providing the necessary employee  
training to guard against bribery and conflicts of interest.
High on the group’s list in 2016: updating the Company’s Code of  
Business Conduct. Vice President of Ethics & Compliance Mark Sifferlen  
wants to make sure the code remains relevant to employees.“People and circumstances change,  
so we have to continually do everything  
we can to help our employees understand 
the importance of ethical behavior,” Sifferlen said. 
REVIEWING 
SUPPLIERS AND THIRD PARTIES
One of the major tasks undertaken by 
Ethics & Compliance in 2015 was to review thousands of Cummins suppliers to 
determine if the actions of any represent a 
legal or reputational risk to the company.
As a global corporation, Cummins relies 
on a number of external companies and 
vendors to sell and service its products, bid 
on business, obtain licenses and permits, and interact with officials to move products across borders. This group includes independent distributors and dealers,  
sales agents, consultants, customs 
brokers, and a number of other people –  as many as 10,000 suppliers and third parties in all.]CUMMINS CODE OF  
BUSINESS CONDUCT
Cummins Code of Business Conduct is built around  
10 Ethical Principles to help make Cummins a  sustainable company and a great place to work:
01 We follow the law everywhere
02 We will embrace diverse perspectives  
and backgrounds and treat all people  with dignity and respect.
03 We will compete fairly and honestly.
04 We will avoid conflicts of interest.
05 We will demand that everything we  do leads to a cleaner, healthier and  safer environment.
06 We will protect our technology, our  information and our intellectual property.
07 We will demand that our financial records  are accurate and that our reporting  processes are clear and understandable.
08 We will strive to improve our communities.
09 We will communicate honestly and with integrity.
10 We will create a culture where employees  take responsibility for ethical behavior.
Cummins Inc.  SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2015-2016
133GOVERNANCEEthics & Compliance put a special focus in 
these areas and used screening agencies, which have their own databases based 
on court records, media reports and other 
documents, to conduct an initial review. In a few cases, “boots on the ground” research was required to resolve questions. 
The team prioritized the results and put 
together remedial action plans where  necessary, but in general didn’t find many critical issues.
It did, however, conclude that it was much 
easier to screen companies before they 
became a supplier to Cummins than to review them after the fact.
To learn more, Ethics & Compliance 
worked with the company’s Law 
Department, which has its own review system, and Cummins’ Indirect Purchasing Department, which also has a screening process. Each process had its merits  
but the three groups generally agreed  
that improvements could be made.  They are working together in 2016  to make changes.SUPPLIER CODE 
OF CONDUCT
Cummins’ Supplier Code of Conduct 
applies to all businesses that provide products or services to Cummins and  
its subsidiaries, joint ventures, divisions  
or affiliates. 
Available in 15 languages, the supplier 
code is built around seven principles and 
helps Cummins ensure that it is doing 
business with other companies around  the world that share its values for sustainable practices.
All new suppliers receive a copy of 
Cummins’ Supplier Code of Conduct 
and the company encourages them to adopt it. If the supplier already has a code that at least meets Cummins’ minimum 
requirements, it sometimes is allowed to 
use its existing code.
Cummins’ top suppliers, who collectively 
receive about 80 percent of the company’s total spending, are required to certify their 
intent to comply with Cummins’ Supplier 
Code of Conduct.The company in 2016 is working to make available to suppliers Cummins’ policies relevant to the supplier code to help drive 
home the code’s importance to Cummins.
TRAINING
Cummins uses a comprehensive 
compliance training program to  ensure employees understand the  
Code of Business Conduct and  
company policies that support the  code’s 10 ethical principles.  The training program also emphasizes  
to employees the important role they  
play in enforcement of the code. Employees can report any problems  they see on line or via a toll-free  hotline – anonymously where  
permitted by law. 
Using the Cummins Learning  
Center, Ethics & Compliance  can target specific professional  
and administrative employee  
groups with the training most  important to them and their   CUMMINS

WHAT’S NEXT
UPDATING THE CODE
The most urgent item on the Ethics &  
Compliance priority list in 2016 is updating  
Cummins’ Business Code of Conduct. 
It’s been three years since the code was  
refreshed and Vice President for Ethics &  
Compliance Mark Sifferlen says there are a  
lot of new employees at the company.  
In addition, Cummins has undergone a lot of  
changes, especially in the first quarter of 2016.
“These are important developments at our  
company that will make us stronger when better 
markets return,” he said. “But we want to make  
sure our employees around the world continue  
living our Values consistent with our Vision and 
Mission and our Business Code of Conduct.”
He doesn’t expect significant changes to the code 
principles but he wants to make sure it remains 
relevant to employees no matter where they are 
based or how long they have been with the company.

email when it is time to take an appropriate ethics training and then the training is 
delivered on line.
More than 15 courses are offered as part 
of the company’s compliance training, ranging from Anti-Bribery to Careful 
Communications and Treatment of  
Each Other at Work.
Both the Code of Business Conduct and 
the Treatment of Each Other at Work trainings start with classroom sessions for 
new employees as part of the Cummins 
OnBoarding program.ENFORCEMENT
An annual certification process requires Cummins employees to certify their compliance with the Business Code of 
Conduct and the policies supporting it,  
and report any exceptions to the company.
In 2015, 20,577 employees and officers, 
including all members of the Board of 
Directors, completed the annual Ethics 
Certification. That compares to 18,979 in 2014. Internal Audit and the Cummins legal staff reviewed any exceptions to ensure they were documented and investigated.
The process was altered in 2015 to  
enable employees who wanted to learn more about a particular principle to get  a more in-depth explanation including  
a look at the relevant company policies. 
The Ethics & Compliance staff is exploring whether it needs to increase its education efforts in areas where more information was frequently requested.
Training and agreeing to follow the  
code, however, is not enough. A team  of Master Investigators located around the world investigate reported violations  
to the Code of Conduct.COMPLIANCE TRAINING
Thousands of employees receive ethics and compliance training every year at Cummins.  
These figures are accumulated enrollments of active employees since 2005, when the oldest  
courses were first offered. The completion rates reflect the number of completions by the  
end of the first quarter of 2016. The Ethics and Compliance team released Data Privacy  
and Export Compliance 2016 training courses in the first quarter of 2016.

137GOVERNANCEERM TURNS 
FOCUS TO 74 
KEY SITES
Cummins believes aggressive  
risk management is a key  
step toward sustainability. 
Identifying and addressing risk helps the company continue operating as efficiently and 
profitably as possible in the face of challenges. Sometimes, effective risk management can 
also determine additional opportunities for success.
With the completion of Business Continuity Plans at every Cummins site (more than 500 in 
all) around the world in 2015, the company’s Enterprise Risk Management function focused 
its attention on 74 locations deemed critical to Cummins’ operations.
Cummins’ Risk Insurance team sponsored a Six Sigma project to identify sites critical to the 
company’s continued operation. Senior leaders affirmed the selection of these sites as key 
to Cummins’ on-going profitability.
Several of the 74 have undergone “stress tests,” table-top exercises simulating any 
number of real world emergencies to assess their continuity plans. Cummins’ locations in 
Charleston, South Carolina (USA) area, for example, underwent a stress test in 2015 that 
included localized flooding as one potential emergency.Just a short time later, Cummins sites  
in the Charleston area experienced  actual flood conditions and reported  
an improved response thanks to the  
table-top exercise they had undergone  just a short time earlier.
“It’s really important to work through the 
gaps and redundancies so you have 
the right people in the right places when 
something happens,” said Bindu Yadlapalli, Director – Enterprise Risk Management in the Corporate Strategy Department. She 
said more stress tests are planned in 2016.
Enterprise Risk Management has other 
responsibilities at Cummins. In 2015, the team executed a risk assessment that involved key leaders across the company.  
The objective of the risk assessment was 
to provide the Board of Directors, the Cummins Leadership Team and other key stakeholders with an enterprise view 
of significant business risks that could 
adversely affect Cummins’ ability to achieve operational and strategic objectives.The risk assessment accomplished  three important objectives:
 »Developing a common definition and 
understanding of key business risks that 
are inherent to Cummins’ operations and could damage the company.
 »The creation of a framework to evaluate risks consistently across business units 
and functional areas, which allowed for a 
company-wide prioritization of risks and risk responses.
 »Recognition of the company’s risk 
management capabilities and controls 
already in place to effectively prevent risks from materializing or to minimize the impact of risk events.
Risk Management also streamlined 
the dashboard used by the company’s 
Board of Directors to meet its oversight responsibilities at Cummins. The team also worked to eliminate any redundancies  
with Global Security and Risk Insurance, 
ensuring both alignment and efficiency.
 
 Working with Corporate Security and Corporate Communications, Risk Management also helped with the company’s 
response to the Ebola outbreak in Africa, 
and the unit worked with Corporate Security to update Cummins’ health policy  
to make sure Cummins sites had everything  
they needed to respond appropriately.
RISK AND THE 
ENVIRONMENT
Environmental risks are considered  
by Cummins sites as part of their  risk management efforts.
Water is a key consideration.  
Thirty sites in nine countries listed water – ranging from utilities failure  to water supply interruption –  
as a significant potential risk. 
These sites also identified potential 
mitigation plans in the event there  was a water-related disruption.]

EMPHASIZES 
SAFE BEHAVIORS
The Global Security team has  
supported company employees, 
travelers and expatriates for the past  
five years through the Cummins 
Response Center (CRC).  The CRC is a 24/7 resource for travel, 
security and medical support.  As the global security climate has become 
increasingly dynamic, Cummins recognizes 
that securing its people and assets is a team effort that requires commitment from every employee.
In response, Cummins Global Security has 
launched a behavior change initiative to highlight three security behaviors that all employees can adopt to further increase Cummins’ security posture.  
The behaviors include:
01 Displaying their identification badge 
when on Cummins property.
02 Appropriately classifying documents 
by their level of confidentiality.
03 Reporting all security concerns to site 
security or the Cummins Response Center. “It is important that all employees become active participants for a more secure Cummins and adopt these behaviors,” 
said Shelley Stewart, Executive Director 
of Global Security, Facilities, Aviation and Hospitality.
The behaviors were identified by a global 
team of security experts to ensure the 
behavior change initiative would be impactful and applicable across the enterprise. 
With the launch of the behavior change 
initiative, employees will receive training on 
how to exhibit these behaviors as well as guidance on other security behaviors that can be adopted. ]

the company and the communities where it does business.   
The team focuses on energy policy, environmental standards and 
enforcement, taxes, trade, transportation, education and more.
Cummins maintains an office in 
Washington, D.C. (U.S.A.), but with more than 40 percent of the company’s sales 
coming from outside the United States,  
the company also has government relations employees in China,  South America, India and Russia.
The government relations team works 
to ensure Cummins’ voice is heard by government policymakers across the globe. For example, the company works extensively across multiple countries and 
regions to promote, protect and enforce 
global emissions standards, and supports government efforts to establish greenhouse gas and fuel consumption standards for 
commercial vehicles.  
Cummins’ Government Relations staff  
also works to foster greater international   cooperation and understanding among the various countries where the company operates. Cummins has hosted 
international visitors to its headquarters 
in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.A.), and other sites.  The company also hosts U.S. and other government visits at its international 
sites to encourage best practice sharing 
on issues like emissions enforcement, development of fuel efficiency standards, and industrial efficiency through combined heat and power projects.
The Government Relations team is also 
working to improve Cummins communities in the U.S. and globally by supporting efforts to expand access to quality 
education and training as well as opposing 
legislation that would impact diversity and fair treatment for all employees.
