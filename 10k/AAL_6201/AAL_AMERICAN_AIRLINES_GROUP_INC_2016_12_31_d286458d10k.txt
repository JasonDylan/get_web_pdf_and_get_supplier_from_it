PART I 
 


ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview 
American Airlines Group Inc. (AAG), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned
subsidiaries are American Airlines, Inc. (American), Envoy Aviation Group Inc. (Envoy), PSA Airlines, Inc. (PSA) and Piedmont Airlines, Inc. (Piedmont). AAG was formed in 1982 under the name AMR Corporation (AMR) as the parent company of American,
which was founded in 1934. On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the
Merger). Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. On December 30, 2015, in order to simplify AAG’s internal corporate structure, US Airways Group merged with and into
AAG, with AAG as the surviving corporation and, immediately thereafter, US Airways, Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group, merged with and into American, with American as the surviving corporation. 
AAG’s and American’s principal executive offices are located at 4333 Amon Carter Boulevard, Fort Worth,
Texas 76155 and our telephone number is 817-963-1234. 
Airline Operations  Our primary business activity is the operation of a major network carrier, providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo. 
Together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as
American Eagle, our airline operates an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries, principally from our hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia,
Phoenix and Washington, D.C. In 2016, approximately 199 million passengers boarded our mainline and regional flights. During 2016, we launched new nonstop service between Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Hong Kong as well as between
LAX and Auckland, New Zealand. We also launched our first-ever regularly scheduled flights to Cuba in 2016 with non-stop service to Havana from Miami and Charlotte and to Cienfuegos, Holguin, Camaguey, Santa
Clara and Varadero from Miami, making us amongst the top leaders in air service between the U.S. and Cuba.  As of December 31, 2016, we operated 930 mainline aircraft and are supported by our regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers, which operated an additional 606 regional
aircraft. See Part I, Item 2. Properties for further discussion on our mainline and regional aircraft and “Regional” below for further discussion on our regional operations. 
American is a founding member of the oneworld alliance, whose members and members-elect serve more than
1,000 destinations with approximately 14,250 daily flights to over 150 countries. See “Ticket Distribution and Marketing Agreements” below for further discussion on the oneworld alliance and other agreements with domestic and
international airlines.  See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “Operational Highlights,” “Financial Overview,” “AAG’s Results of Operations” and “American’s Results of Operations” for
further discussion of AAG’s and American’s operating results and operating performance. Also, see Note 13 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 11 to American’s Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding our operating segments and operating revenue in principal geographic areas.

Regional 
We have arrangements with regional carriers to provide us with regional jet and turboprop service under the brand
name “American Eagle.” The American Eagle carriers include our wholly-owned regional carriers, Envoy, PSA and Piedmont, as well as third-party regional carriers including Republic Airline Inc. (Republic), Mesa Airlines, Inc. (Mesa), Air
Wisconsin Airlines Corporation (Air Wisconsin), Compass Airlines, LLC (Compass), ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. (ExpressJet), SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest) and Trans States Airlines, Inc. (Trans States). These carriers are an integral component of our
operating network. We rely heavily on feeder traffic from these carriers, which transport passengers to our hubs from low-density markets that are not economical for us to serve with larger, mainline aircraft.
In addition, regional carriers offer complementary service in our existing mainline markets by operating flights during off-peak periods between mainline flights. During 2016, approximately 54 million
passengers boarded our regional carriers’ planes, approximately 44% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights. Of these passengers, approximately 26 million were enplaned by our wholly-owned regional carriers and approximately
28 million were enplaned by third-party regional carriers. All American Eagle carriers use logos, service marks, aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to our mainline operations. 
The American Eagle arrangements are principally in the form of capacity purchase agreements. The capacity purchase
agreements provide that all revenues, including passenger, in-flight, ancillary, mail and freight revenues, go to us. In return, we agree to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an
agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board. In addition, these agreements provide that we reimburse 100% of certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees and passenger liability insurance. We control
marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories.  A limited number of regional aircraft
are operated for us under prorate agreements, under which the regional carriers receive a prorated share of ticket revenue and pay certain service fees to us. The prorate carriers are responsible for all costs incurred operating the applicable
aircraft.  Cargo  Our cargo division provides a wide range of freight and mail services, with facilities and interline connections available across the globe. In 2016, we were named the Cargo Airline of the Year
for the second year running and Best Cargo Airline from the Americas for the ninth consecutive year by Air Cargo News.  Ticket
Distribution and Marketing Agreements  Passengers can purchase tickets for travel on American through
several distribution channels, including our website (www.aa.com), our reservations centers and third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport),
conventional travel agents and online travel agents (e.g., Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity). To remain competitive, we need to successfully manage our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality
of third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively
the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.”  In general, beyond nonstop city pairs,
carriers that have the greatest ability to seamlessly connect passengers to and from markets have a competitive advantage. In some cases, however, foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers’ rights to transport passengers beyond designated
gateway cities in foreign countries. In order to improve access to domestic and foreign markets, we have arrangements with other airlines including the oneworld alliance, other cooperation agreements, joint business agreements (JBAs), and
marketing relationships.

Member of oneworld Alliance 
American is a founding member of the oneworld alliance, which includes Air Berlin, British Airways, Cathay
Pacific Airways, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, LAN Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, SriLankan Airlines and TAM Airlines. The oneworld alliance links the networks of the member
carriers to enhance customer service and smooth connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking the carriers’ loyalty programs and access to the carriers’ airport lounge facilities. 
Cooperation and Joint Business Agreements 
American is party to antitrust-immunized cooperation agreements with British Airways, Iberia, Finnair, Royal
Jordanian, Japan Airlines, LAN Airlines and LAN Peru. American has also established JBAs with British Airways, Iberia and Finnair, and separately Japan Airlines, that enable the carriers to cooperate on flights between particular destinations and
allow pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs, enhanced loyalty program reciprocity and cooperation in other areas. American and its joint business partners received regulatory approval to enter into these JBAs and cooperation agreements.
 We signed a revised JBA with Qantas Airways and applied for antitrust immunity with the U.S. Department
of Transportation (DOT) for the revised relationship, but we withdrew that application in November 2016 after it was tentatively denied by the DOT. However, we expect that our existing, more limited cooperation with Qantas will continue, and we
intend to file a new application for antitrust immunity with the DOT later this year. In addition, we have signed JBAs with certain air carriers of the LATAM Airlines Group and have applied for approval in the relevant jurisdictions affected by such
agreements, which applications are still pending before the relevant regulators.  Marketing Relationships
 To improve access to each other’s markets, various U.S. and foreign air carriers, including
American, have established marketing relationships with other airlines. These marketing agreements generally provide enhanced customer choice by means of an expanded network with reciprocal loyalty program participation and joint sales cooperation.
American currently has marketing relationships with Air Berlin, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cape Air, Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, EL AL, Etihad Airways, Fiji Airways, Finnair, Gulf Air, Hainan Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines,
Iberia, Interjet, Japan Airlines, Jet Airways, Jetstar Group (includes Jetstar Airways and Jetstar Japan), Korean Air, LATAM (includes LAN Airlines, LAN Argentina, LAN Colombia, LAN Ecuador, LAN Peru, TAM Airlines and TAM Mercosur), Malaysia
Airlines, Niki Airlines, Qantas Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, Seaborne Airlines and WestJet.  Loyalty Program
 Our loyalty program, AAdvantage® was established to develop passenger loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued patronage.
AAdvantage was named Best Elite Program in the Americas at the 2016 Freddie Awards. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of over 1,000 program
participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded travel on American and participating airlines,
membership to our Admirals Club® or for other non-travel awards
from our program participants.  All travel on eligible tickets counts toward qualification for elite
status in the AAdvantage program. Elite members can enjoy additional benefits of the AAdvantage program, including complimentary upgrades, mileage bonuses, complimentary access to Preferred Seats, checked bags at no charge, First and Business Class check-in, priority security, priority boarding and priority baggage delivery.

Table of Contents
Most travel awards are subject to capacity-controlled seating. A
member’s mileage credit does not expire as long as that member has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 18 months. Under our agreements with AAdvantage members and program partners, we reserve the right to change the AAdvantage
program at any time without notice, and may end the program with six months’ notice. Program rules, partners, special offers, awards and requisite mileage levels for awards are subject to change. 
During 2016, our members redeemed approximately 10 million awards including travel redemptions for flights and
upgrades on American and other air carriers, as well as redemption of car and hotel awards, club memberships and merchandise. Approximately 6.3% of our 2016 total revenue passenger miles flown were from award travel. 
In order to ensure we are rewarding our most loyal customers, we announced a program change effective in the second
half of 2016 whereby our members began earning mileage credits based on dollars spent rather than distance flown for travel on American-marketed flights. In addition, our members earn bonus mileage credits when elite status is obtained. For every
dollar spent, non-status members earn five mileage credits, but Gold, Platinum and Executive Platinum status holders earn bonus mileage credits of seven, eight and eleven mileage credits, respectively.
Additionally, in January 2017, we added Platinum Pro as a fourth elite level for members. Platinum Pro status holders earn nine mileage credits for every dollar spent. 
See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for more information on our loyalty program. 
Industry Competition  Domestic  The markets in which we
operate are highly competitive. On most of our domestic non-stop routes, we currently face competing service from at least one, and sometimes more than one, domestic airline, including: Alaska Airlines,
Allegiant Air, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines and Virgin America. Competition is even greater between cities that require a connection, where the major
airlines compete via their respective hubs. In addition, we face competition on some of our connecting routes from airlines operating point-to-point service on such
routes. We also compete with all-cargo and charter airlines and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation. 
On all of our routes, pricing decisions are affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from other
airlines. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, target promotions and loyalty
program initiatives. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slack travel periods, when they begin service to new cities or when they have excess capacity, to generate cash flow, to maximize
revenue per available seat mile and to establish, increase or preserve market share. We have often elected to match discount or promotional fares initiated by other air carriers in certain markets in order to compete in those markets. Most airlines
will quickly match price reductions in a particular market. In addition, low-fare, low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, and so-called ultra-low-cost carriers, such as Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, compete in many of the markets in
which we operate and competition from these carriers is increasing.  In addition to price competition,
airlines compete for market share by increasing the size of their route system and the number of markets they serve. The American Eagle regional carriers increase the number of markets we serve by flying to lower demand markets and providing
connections at our hubs. Many of our competitors also own or have agreements with regional airlines that provide similar services at their hubs and other locations. We also compete on the basis of scheduling (frequency and flight times),
availability of nonstop flights, on-time performance, type of equipment, cabin

configuration, amenities provided to passengers, loyalty programs, the automation of travel agent reservation systems, onboard products, markets served and other services. We compete with both
major network airlines and low-cost carriers throughout our network. 
International  In addition to our extensive domestic service, we provide international service to Canada, Central and South America, Asia, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In providing international air
transportation, we compete with U.S. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines, including carriers based in the Middle East, the three largest of which we believe benefit from significant
government subsidies. In order to increase our ability to compete for international air transportation service, which is subject to extensive government regulation, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into marketing relationships, alliances,
cooperation agreements and JBAs to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route networks. See “Ticket Distribution and Marketing Agreements” above for further discussion. 
Employees and Labor Relations  The airline business is labor intensive. In 2016, mainline and regional salaries, wages and benefits were our largest expense and represented approximately 35% of our total operating expenses.
 Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act (RLA),
which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). When an RLA CBA becomes amendable, if either
party to the agreement wishes to modify its terms, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed under the RLA and as agreed by the parties. Under the RLA, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and, if no agreement is reached,
either party may request the NMB to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last for many months and even for several years. If no
agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare under the RLA at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to
binding arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, an initial 30-day “cooling off” period commences. Following the conclusion of that 30-day
“cooling off” period, if no agreement has been reached, “self-help” (as described below) can begin unless a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) is established. A PEB examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution.
The PEB process lasts for 30 days and (if no resolution is reached) is followed by another “cooling off” period of 30 days. At the end of a “cooling off” period (unless an agreement is reached, a PEB is established or action is
taken by Congress), the labor organization may exercise “self-help,” such as a strike, and the airline may resort to its own “self-help,” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments to the CBA and the hiring
of new employees to replace any striking workers.  The table below presents our approximate number of
active full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2016.

 Our union-represented mainline employees are covered by agreements that are not currently amendable. Joint collective bargaining agreements
(JCBAs) have been reached with post-Merger employee groups, except the approximately 35,000 maintenance, fleet service, stores and planner employees represented by the TWU-IAM who are covered by separate CBAs
that are not yet amendable. Until those agreements become amendable, negotiations for JCBAs will be conducted outside the traditional RLA bargaining process as described above, and, in the meantime, no self-help will be permissible. In August 2016,
we reached interim agreements with the TWU-IAM to move the employees they represent to new pay rates and to provide additional flexibility in assigning work to these employees. These new interim agreements
provide immediate and significant pay increases and do not constitute new JCBAs, and negotiations for such JCBAs will continue.   


(3) 
 Among our wholly-owned regional subsidiaries, the Piedmont fleet and passenger service employees and the PSA mechanics and dispatchers have
agreements that are now amendable and are engaged in traditional RLA negotiations. The Envoy passenger service employees are engaged in traditional RLA negotiations for an initial CBA.

Table of Contents
None of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully
engage in concerted refusals to work, such as strikes, slow-downs, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. Nonetheless, there is a risk that disgruntled employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more
concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance.  For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.”
 Aircraft Fuel  Our operations and financial results are significantly affected by the availability and price of jet fuel. Based on our 2017 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption, we estimate that a one
cent per gallon increase in aviation fuel price would increase our 2017 annual fuel expense by $43 million.  The following table shows annual aircraft fuel consumption and costs, including taxes, for our mainline operations for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (gallons and aircraft fuel expense in millions).

 Total fuel expenses for our wholly-owned and third-party regional carriers
operating under capacity purchase agreements of American were $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $2.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption.
As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel
consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.  Fuel prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years. We cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters, political disruptions
or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and
terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the
future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions
in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.” 
Seasonality and Other Factors  Due to the greater demand for air travel during the summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year tend to be greater than revenues in the first and
fourth quarters of the year. General economic conditions, fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern.
Therefore, our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

Domestic and Global Regulatory Landscape 
General  Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. Domestically, the DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise significant regulatory authority
over air carriers.  The DOT, among other things, oversees domestic and international codeshare
agreements, international route authorities, competition and consumer protection matters such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) along with the DOT have
jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters.  The FAA similarly exercises safety oversight and regulates
most operational matters of our business, including how we operate and maintain our aircraft. FAA requirements cover, among other things, required technology and necessary onboard equipment; systems, procedures and training necessary to ensure the
continuous airworthiness of our fleet of aircraft; safety measures and equipment; crew scheduling limitations and experience requirements; and many other technical aspects of airline operations. Additionally, the FAA sets pilot qualification
standards and imposes complex rest requirements for pilots, as well as stringent duty period requirements for pilots and flight attendants.  The FAA also controls the national airspace system, including operational rules and fees for air traffic control (ATC) services. The efficiency, reliability and capacity of the ATC network has a
significant impact on our costs and on the timeliness of our operations.  The U.S. Postal Service has
jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services.  Airport Access and
Operations  Domestically, any U.S. airline authorized by the DOT is generally free to operate
scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its territories, with the exception of certain airports that require landing and take-off rights and authorizations (slots) and other
facilities, and certain airports that impose geographic limitations on operations or curtail operations based on the time of day. Operations at three major domestic airports we serve (John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and La Guardia
Airport (LGA) in New York City, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in Washington, D.C.) and certain foreign airports we serve (including London Heathrow Airport (LHR)) are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of
slots or similar regulatory mechanisms that limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period. In addition
to slot restrictions, operations at LGA and DCA also are limited based on the stage length of the flight. 
Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as Chicago O’Hare International Airport
(ORD) and LAX, where the airport gate and other facilities are inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide.  Existing law also permits domestic local airport authorities to implement procedures and impose restrictions designed to abate noise, provided such procedures and restrictions do not unreasonably
interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs. 
  11



Table of Contents
Airline Fares, Taxes and User Fees 
Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation. The DOT maintains
authority over certain international fares, rates and charges, but applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition, international fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which we
serve. While air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs, substantial commissions, fare overrides and discounts to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets. 
Airlines are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the “ticket tax,” on
domestic and international air transportation, and to collect other taxes and charge other fees, such as foreign taxes, security fees and passenger facility charges. Airlines typically collect and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate
governmental agencies. Although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. These taxes and fees are subject to increase from time to time. 
DOT Passenger Protection Rules 
The DOT regulates airline interactions with passengers through the reservations process, at the airport and on board
the aircraft. Among other things, these regulations govern how our fares are displayed online, required customer disclosures, access by disabled passengers, handling of long onboard flight delays and reporting of mishandled bags. In addition, the
DOT is likely to issue a regulation in 2017 that would require air carriers to refund checked bag fees in the event of certain delays in delivery.  International  International air
transportation is subject to extensive government regulation, including aviation agreements between the U.S. and other countries or governmental authorities, such as the European Union (EU). Moreover, alliances with international carriers may be
subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted route authority access between the U.S. and the foreign
markets. While the U.S. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of markets important to us, including China, do not have open skies agreements. 
In addition, foreign countries impose passenger protection rules, which are analogous to, and often meet or exceed
the requirements of, the DOT passenger protection rules discussed above. In cases where these foreign requirements exceed the DOT rules, we may bear additional burdens and liabilities. Further, various foreign airport authorities impose noise
restrictions at their local airports.  Security 
Since shortly after the events of September 11, 2001, substantially all aspects of civil aviation security in
the U.S. or affecting U.S. carriers have been controlled or regulated by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Requirements include flight deck security; carriage of federal air marshals at no charge; enhanced security screening of
passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors; fingerprint-based background checks of all employees and vendor employees with access to secure areas of airports; and the provision of certain passenger data to the federal government and
other international border security authorities, for security and immigration controls. Funding for the TSA is provided by a combination of air carrier fees, passenger fees and taxpayer funds. Customs and Border Protection, which, like the TSA, is
part of the Department of Homeland 
  12

Security, also promulgates requirements, performs services and collects fees that impact our provision of services. Additionally, we have at times found it necessary or desirable to make
significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while reducing their impact on our customers, such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. 
Environmental Matters  Environmental Regulation  The airline
industry is subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on our operations include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990,
the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund Act). The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned
federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental laws and regulations which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements.  Revised underground storage tank regulations issued by the EPA in 2015 could affect airport fuel hydrant systems, as certain of those systems may need to be modified in order to comply with
applicable portions of the revised regulations. In addition, related to the EPA and state regulations pertaining to stormwater management, several U.S. airport authorities are actively engaged in efforts to limit discharges of deicing fluid into the
environment, often by requiring airlines to participate in the building or reconfiguring of airport deicing facilities.  The environmental laws to which we are subject include those related to responsibility for potential soil and groundwater contamination. We are conducting investigation and remediation activities to
address soil and groundwater conditions at several sites, including airports and maintenance bases. We anticipate that the ongoing costs of such activities will not have a material impact on our operations. In addition, we have been named as a
potentially responsible party (PRP) at certain Superfund sites. Our alleged volumetric contributions at such sites are relatively small in comparison to total contributions of all PRPs; we anticipate that any future payments of costs at such sites
will not have a material impact on our operations.  Aircraft Emissions and Climate Change Requirements
 Many aspects of our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations
and concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, the EU has established the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to regulate GHG emissions in the EU. The EU adopted a directive in 2008 under which each EU member state is
required to extend the ETS to aviation operations. However, the EU ETS has never fully been imposed, in large part due to the global effort to moderate international aviation emissions solely through the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO). The U.S. enacted legislation in November 2012 intended to encourage an international solution through ICAO, but which also authorizes the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to prohibit U.S. airlines from participating in the ETS. 
In October 2016, ICAO passed a resolution adopting the ICAO Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for
International Aviation (CORSIA), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. The CORSIA applies to international aviation, and does not directly impact domestic U.S. flights. The CORSIA
was supported by the board of Airlines For 
  13



Table of Contents

America (the principal U.S. airline trade association), the International Airline Trade Association (IATA) (the principal international airline trade association), and by American and many other
U.S. and foreign airlines. The CORSIA will increase operating costs for American and most other airlines, including other U.S. airlines that operate internationally, but the implementation of a global program, as compared to regional emission
reduction schemes, should help to ensure that resulting increases in operating costs will be more predictable and more evenly applied to airlines. The CORSIA is expected to be implemented in phases, beginning in 2021. Certain details still need to
be developed and the impact of the CORSIA cannot be fully predicted. On February 3, 2017, the European Commission proposed to extend its stay on the extra-territorial application of the EU ETS until 2021, in anticipation of the implementation
of the ICAO CORSIA. The EU noted its intent to continue to apply ETS to intra-EU flights until at least 2021, but also stated that this could be revisited in light of the CORSIA. The EU stated that it plans to
reevaluate ETS again in 2021, in light of its assessment of the progress to implement the CORSIA. The current EU ETS proposal must be approved through the EU Council and Parliament. 
The EPA recently issued an endangerment finding that aircraft engine GHG emissions cause or contribute to air
pollution, which is a precursor to EPA regulation of aircraft engine GHG emission standards. It is anticipated that any such standards established by EPA would closely align with emission standards currently being developed by ICAO. In February
2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection recommended that ICAO adopt carbon dioxide certification standards that would apply to new type aircraft certified beginning in 2020, and would be phased in for newly manufactured
existing aircraft type designs starting in 2023.  In addition, several states, including California,
have adopted or are considering initiatives to regulate emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emissions inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. 
We have taken a number of actions that mitigate our GHG emissions and conserve fuel such as: 
 


 
•
 
 Retiring older aircraft and replacing them with new, more fuel-efficient aircraft 
 


 
•
 
 Reducing fuel consumption through our Fuel Smart Program, which is an employee-led effort to safely
reduce fuel consumption   


 
•
 
 Working with the FAA and vendors to facilitate efficient airspace procedures, which also reduces aircraft emissions
  


 
•
 
 Replacing existing cargo containers with lightweight versions 
 


 
•
 
 Purchasing new, more fuel-efficient ground support equipment, certain of which is alternative-fuel and electric powered.
 For further information, see our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, available on
our website at www.aa.com.  Impact of Regulatory Requirements on Our Business 
Regulatory requirements, including but not limited to those discussed above, could affect operations and increase
operating costs for the airline industry, including our airline subsidiaries, and future regulatory developments may continue to do the same in the future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Ongoing data security
requirements and obligations could increase our costs, and any significant data security incident could disrupt our operations and harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition,” “If we are unable to obtain
and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be

ITEM 1A.  RISK
 FACTORS  Below are certain risk factors that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities. We caution the reader that
these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent
to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business. 
Risks Relating to AAG and Industry-Related Risks  Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.  Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S.
economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by
our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our revenues. See also “The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic” below. 
Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel
costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity. 
Our operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft
fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Jet fuel market prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years and prices continue to be highly volatile. 
Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the
price of fuel can have a material effect on our operating results and liquidity. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry and unpredictability of the market for air travel, we can offer no assurance that we may be able to increase our
fares, impose fuel surcharges or otherwise increase revenues sufficiently to offset fuel price increases. Similarly, we cannot predict the effect or the actions of our competitors if the current low fuel prices remain in place for a significant
period of time or fuel prices decrease in the future.  Although we are currently able to obtain adequate
supplies of aircraft fuel, we cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in
fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity,
environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future.  Our aviation fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide meaningful price protection against increases in fuel costs. Prior to the closing of the Merger, we sought to manage the risk of fuel
price increases by using derivative contracts. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. Accordingly, as of
December 31, 2016, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.

  16



Table of Contents
If in the future we enter into derivative contracts to hedge our fuel
consumption, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have derivatives in place to provide any particular level of protection against increased fuel costs or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our derivative
contracts. To the extent we use derivative contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if prices decline significantly, such derivative contracts may limit our ability to benefit from lower fuel costs in the
future. Also, a rapid decline in the projected price of fuel at a time when we have fuel hedging contracts in place could materially adversely impact our short-term liquidity, because hedge counterparties could require that we post collateral in the
form of cash or letters of credit. See also the discussion in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – “Aircraft Fuel.” 
The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic. 
Our competitors include other major domestic airlines and foreign, regional and new entrant airlines, as well as
joint ventures formed by some of these airlines, many of which have more financial or other resources and/or lower cost structures than ours, as well as other forms of transportation, including rail and private automobiles. In many of our markets we
compete with at least one low-cost air carrier. Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity, amenities and promotions, which can have a
substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues, but on overall industry revenues. These factors may become even more significant in periods when the industry experiences large losses, as airlines under financial stress, or in bankruptcy, may
institute pricing structures intended to achieve near-term survival rather than long-term viability.  Low-cost carriers, including so-called ultra-low-cost carriers, have a profound impact on
industry revenues. Using the advantage of low unit costs, these carriers offer lower fares in order to shift demand from larger, more established airlines, and represent significant competitors, particularly for customers who fly infrequently and
are price sensitive and tend not to be loyal to any one particular carrier. A number of low-cost carriers have announced growth strategies including commitments to acquire significant numbers of aircraft for
delivery in the next few years. These low-cost carriers are attempting to continue to increase their market share through growth and, potentially, consolidation, and could continue to have an impact on our
revenues and overall performance. For example, as a result of divestitures completed in connection with gaining regulatory approval for the Merger, low-fare, low-cost
carriers have gained additional access in a number of markets, including DCA, a slot-controlled airport. In addition, we and several other large network carriers have announced “basic economy” fares designed to compete against low-cost carriers and we cannot predict whether these initiatives will be successful or the competitive reaction of the low-cost carriers. The actions of the low-cost carriers, including those described above, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. 
Our presence in international markets is not as extensive as that of some of our competitors. In providing
international air transportation, we compete to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the U.S. and various overseas locations with U.S. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines,
including carriers based in the Middle East, the three largest of which we believe benefit from significant government subsidies. Our international service exposes us to foreign economies and the potential for reduced demand, such as we have
recently experienced in Brazil and Venezuela, when any foreign countries we serve suffer adverse local economic conditions. In addition, open skies agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world provide international airlines
with open access to U.S. markets. See also “Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand
for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.” 
  17



Table of Contents
Certain airline alliances, joint ventures and joint businesses have
been, or may in the future be, granted immunity from antitrust regulations by governmental authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. To the extent alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities
that are not available to us, our ability to effectively compete may be hindered. Our ability to attract and retain customers is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to offer our customers convenient access to desired markets. Our
business could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain or obtain alliance and marketing relationships with other air carriers in desired markets.  We are party to antitrust-immunized cooperation agreements with British Airways, Iberia, Finnair, Royal Jordanian, Japan Airlines, LAN Airlines and LAN Peru. As part of the antitrust-immunized
relationships, we have also established JBAs with British Airways, Iberia and Finnair, and separately with Japan Airlines. We signed a revised JBA with Qantas Airways and applied for antitrust immunity with the DOT for the revised relationship, but
we withdrew that application in November 2016 after it was tentatively denied by the DOT. However, we expect that our existing, more limited cooperation with Qantas will continue, and we intend to file a new application for antitrust immunity with
the DOT this year. In addition, we have signed JBAs with certain air carriers of the LATAM Airlines Group and have applied for approval in the relevant jurisdictions affected by such agreements, which applications are still pending before the
relevant regulators. The foregoing arrangements are important aspects of our international network and we are dependent on the performance of the other airlines party to those agreements. No assurances can be given as to any benefits that we may
derive from such arrangements or any other arrangements that may ultimately be implemented.  Additional
mergers and other forms of industry consolidation, including antitrust immunity grants, may take place and may not involve us as a participant. Depending on which carriers combine and which assets, if any, are sold or otherwise transferred to other
carriers in connection with any such combinations, our competitive position relative to the post-combination carriers or other carriers that acquire such assets could be harmed. In addition, as carriers combine through traditional mergers or
antitrust immunity grants, their route networks will grow, and that growth will result in greater overlap with our network, which in turn could result in lower overall market share and revenues for us. Such consolidation is not limited to the U.S.,
but could include further consolidation among international carriers in Europe and elsewhere.  Ongoing data
security requirements and obligations could increase our costs, and any significant data security incident could disrupt our operations and harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Our business requires the appropriate and secure utilization of customer, employee, business partner and other
sensitive information, and confidence in the networks and systems that allow us to operate. We cannot be certain that we will not be the target of attacks on our networks and intrusions into our data, particularly given recent advances in technical
capabilities, and increased financial and political motivations to carry out cyber-attacks on physical systems, gain unauthorized access to information, and make information unavailable for use through, for example, ransomware or denial-of-service attacks, and otherwise exploit new and existing vulnerabilities in our infrastructure. The risk of a data security incident or disruption, particularly
through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.
Furthermore, in response to these threats there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on attacks on critical infrastructures, including those in the transportation sector, and on data security in the U.S. and abroad (particularly in
the EU), including requirements for varying levels of data subject notification in the event of a data security incident.

In addition, many of our commercial partners, including credit card
companies, have imposed data security standards that we must meet. In particular, we are required by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, founded by the credit card companies, to comply with their highest level of data security
standards. While we continue our efforts to meet these standards, new and revised standards may be imposed that may be difficult for us to meet and could increase our costs. 
A significant data security incident or our failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data security
regulations or other data security standards may impact our brand and expose us to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions, resulting in fines, sanctions or other penalties. Such actions could further harm our reputation, adversely impact our
relationship with our customers, employees, and stockholders, result in material financial impact, and disrupt business operations. Failure to appropriately address these issues could also give rise to similar legal risks and damages. 
Our high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain
additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions. 
We have significant amounts of indebtedness and other obligations, including pension obligations, obligations to
make future payments on flight equipment and property leases, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. Moreover, currently a substantial portion
of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, they:   


 
•
 
 may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness; 
 


 
•
 
 may limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, integration costs,
and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;   


 
•
 
 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby
reducing the funds available for other purposes;   


 
•
 
 make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, industry conditions and catastrophic external events, particularly relative to competitors with
lower relative levels of financial leverage;   


 
•
 
 contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts
available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities;   


 
•
 
 contain restrictive covenants that could:   


 
•
 
 limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay
dividends;   


 
•
 
 significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own operations, the U.S. or global
economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines; 
 


 
•
 
 limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;
and   


 
•
 
 result in an event of default under our indebtedness. 
Further, a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on
the London interbank offered rate for deposits of U.S. dollars (LIBOR). LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general economic conditions, general interest rates, rates set by the Federal 
  19



Table of Contents

Reserve and other central banks, and the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt.
Accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties
making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. See also the discussion of interest rate risk in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk – “Interest.”  These obligations also impact
our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 
We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully. 
Our business plan contemplates significant investments in modernizing our fleet. Significant capital resources will
be required to execute this plan. We estimate that, based on our commitments as of December 31, 2016, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for calendar years 2017-2021
would be approximately $15.5 billion. Accordingly, we will need substantial financing or other capital resources to finance such aircraft. If we are unable to arrange financing for such aircraft at customary advance rates and on terms and
conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase such aircraft or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft with the aircraft manufacturers. Depending on numerous factors, many of which are out
of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets’ view of our prospects and the airline industry in general, and the general availability of debt and equity capital at the time we seek
capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may be available only on onerous terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed
sources of capital to operate successfully. An inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity,
results of operations and financial condition.  Our pension funding obligations are significant.
The amount of these obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. Currently, our minimum funding obligation for our pension plans is
subject to favorable temporary funding rules that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Our minimum pension funding obligations are likely to increase materially beginning in 2019, when we will be required to make contributions relating to the
2018 fiscal year. In addition, we may have significant obligations for other postretirement benefits, the ultimate amount of which depends on, among other things, the outcome of an adversary proceeding related to retiree medical and other
postretirement benefits and life insurance obligations filed in the Chapter 11 Cases.  If our financial condition
worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.  We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. These agreements allow these processing companies, under certain
conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, the failure of American to maintain certain levels of liquidity) to hold an amount of our cash (a holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket

  20



Table of Contents

sales that have been processed by that credit card processor, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. We are not currently required to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to
these requirements. These holdback requirements can be modified at the discretion of the credit card processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition. An increase in the
current holdbacks, up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales, could materially reduce our liquidity. Likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow other entities to impose less-favorable terms, including
the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition.  Union
disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.  Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under the RLA, collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) generally contain “amendable
dates” rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by
the National Mediation Board (NMB). For the dates that the CBAs with our major work groups become amendable under the RLA, see Part I, Item 1. Business – “Employees and Labor Relations.” 
In the case of a CBA that is amendable under the RLA, if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between
the parties, either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several
years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration, and if arbitration is rejected by either
party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During or after that period, a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a
solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day “cooling off” period. At the end of a “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken
by Congress, the labor organization may exercise “self-help,” such as a strike, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
None of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully engage in concerted refusals to work, such as
strikes, slow-downs, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. Nonetheless, there is a risk that disgruntled employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more concerted refusals to work that could individually
or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance. See also Part I, Item 1. Business – “Employees and Labor Relations.” 
The inability to maintain labor costs at competitive levels would harm our financial performance. 
Currently, we believe our labor costs are competitive relative to the other large network carriers. However, we
cannot provide assurance that labor costs going forward will remain competitive because some of our agreements are amendable now and others may become amendable, competitors may significantly reduce their labor costs or we may agree to higher-cost
provisions in our current or future labor negotiations, such as the employee profit sharing program we instituted effective January 1, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 85% of our employees were represented for collective
bargaining purposes by labor unions. Some of our unions have brought and may continue to bring grievances to binding arbitration, including those related to wages. Unions may also bring court actions and may seek to compel us to engage in bargaining
processes where we believe we have no such

obligation. If successful, there is a risk these judicial or arbitral avenues could create material additional costs that we did not anticipate. 
Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
 We operate principally through hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles,
Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Substantially all of our flights either originate in or fly into one of these locations. A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs resulting from air traffic
control (ATC) delays, weather conditions, natural disasters, growth constraints, relations with third-party service providers, failure of computer systems, facility disruptions, labor relations, power supplies, fuel supplies, terrorist activities,
or otherwise could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports,
adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations. 
In order to operate our existing and proposed flight schedule and, where desirable, add service along new or
existing routes, we must be able to maintain and/or obtain adequate gates, check-in counters, operations areas and office space. As airports around the world become more congested, we are not always able to
ensure that our plans for new service can be implemented in a commercially viable manner, given operating constraints at airports throughout our network, including due to inadequate facilities at desirable airports. Further, our operating costs at
airports at which we operate, including our hubs, may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that we may be required to fund, directly or indirectly. In some circumstances, such costs could be imposed by the relevant
airport authority without our approval.  In addition, operations at three major domestic airports,
certain smaller domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through the use of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports.
Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period and may have other operational restrictions as well. In the U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of slots or slot
exemptions at DCA and two New York City airports: JFK and LGA. In addition to slot restrictions, operations at LGA and DCA are also limited based on the stage length of the flight. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of
slots or similar regulatory authority. Similarly, our operations at international airports in Beijing, Frankfurt, London Heathrow, Paris, Tokyo and other airports outside the U.S. are regulated by local slot authorities pursuant to the IATA
Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and applicable local law. We currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally, but not always, been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations
and to change our schedules. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient slots or analogous authorizations in the future or as to the cost of acquiring such rights because, among other reasons, such allocations are often
sought after by other airlines and are subject to changes in governmental policies. We cannot provide any assurance that regulatory changes regarding the allocation of slots or similar regulatory authority will not have a material adverse impact on
our operations.  Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as ORD and LAX,
where the airport gate and other facilities are inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide, or airports such as Dallas Love Field Airport where we have no access to gates at all. 
  22



Table of Contents
Any limitation on our ability to acquire or maintain adequate gates,
ticketing facilities, operations areas, slots (where applicable), or office space could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
If we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations
could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.  A significant portion of our regional operations are conducted by third-party operators on our behalf, primarily under capacity purchase agreements. Due to our reliance on third parties to provide
these essential services, we are subject to the risks of disruptions to their operations, which may result from many of the same risk factors disclosed in this report, such as the impact of adverse economic conditions, the inability of third parties
to hire or retain necessary personnel, including in particular pilots, and other risk factors, such as an out-of-court or bankruptcy restructuring of any of our regional
operators. Many of these third-party regional operators provide significant regional capacity that we would be unable to replace in a short period of time should that operator fail to perform its obligations to us. Volatility in fuel prices,
disruptions to capital markets and adverse economic conditions in general have subjected certain of these third-party regional operators to significant financial pressures, which have led to several bankruptcies among these operators. For example,
one of our significant third-party operators of regional capacity, Republic Airways Holdings Inc. (Republic), commenced a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case on February 25, 2016. As part of Republic’s restructuring process and with bankruptcy
court approval, we entered into an amendment to our contractual relationship with Republic that, among other things, provided for the reduction in the number of aircraft operated by Republic on our behalf to 76 E175 aircraft (a reduction of 20 E170
and nine E175 aircraft). In addition, we have reached a settlement with Republic that has resulted in the allowance of an unsecured claim on behalf of American in the amount of $250 million, to compensate us in part for losses and damages that
we incurred under the existing contract with Republic, which is expected to be settled in the form of common stock of the restructured company. It is not possible, at this point, however, to quantify the value of a recovery on such claim. We may
also experience disruption to our regional operations if we terminate the capacity purchase agreement with one or more of our current operators and transition the services to another provider. Any significant disruption to our regional operations
would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In
addition, our reliance upon others to provide essential services on behalf of our operations may result in our relative inability to control the efficiency and timeliness of contract services. We have entered into agreements with contractors to
provide various facilities and services required for our operations, including distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, provision of information technology and services, regional operations, aircraft maintenance, ground services and
facilities, reservations and baggage handling. Similar agreements may be entered into in any new markets we decide to serve. These agreements are generally subject to termination after notice by the third-party service provider. We are also at risk
should one of these service providers cease operations, and there is no guarantee that we could replace these providers on a timely basis with comparably priced providers, or at all. Any material problems with the efficiency and
timeliness of contract services, resulting from financial hardships or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these
channels.  We rely on third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through
global distribution systems (GDSs) (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents and online travel agents (OTAs) (e.g., Expedia, including its booking sites Orbitz and Travelocity, and The Priceline

  23



Table of Contents

Group), to distribute a significant portion of our airline tickets, and we expect in the future to continue to rely on these channels and hope to expand their ability to distribute and collect
revenues for ancillary products (e.g., fees for selective seating). These distribution channels are more expensive and at present have less functionality in respect of ancillary product offerings than those we operate ourselves, such as our call
centers and our website. Certain of these distribution channels also effectively restrict the manner in which we distribute our products generally. To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution costs and rights,
increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. These imperatives may affect our relationships with GDSs and OTAs, including as
consolidation of OTAs continues or is proposed to continue, and require us to make significant investments in potential new distribution technologies. Any inability to manage our third-party distribution costs, rights and functionality at a
competitive level or any material diminishment or disruption in the distribution of our tickets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our
operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.  Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. In the last several years, Congress has passed laws, and the DOT, the FAA, the TSA and the Department of
Homeland Security have issued a number of directives and other regulations, that affect the airline industry. These requirements impose substantial costs on us and restrict the ways we may conduct our business. 
For example, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and
operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures or operational restrictions. These requirements can be issued with little or no notice, or can otherwise impact our ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft. Additionally, our
failure to comply with such requirements has in the past and may in the future result in fines and other enforcement actions by the FAA or other regulators. In the future, new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on us and
the industry.  DOT consumer rules that took effect in 2010 require procedures for customer handling
during long onboard delays, further regulate airline interactions with passengers through the reservations process, at the airport, and onboard the aircraft, and require disclosures concerning airline fares and ancillary fees such as baggage fees.
The DOT has been aggressively investigating alleged violations of these rules. Other DOT rules apply to post-ticket purchase price increases and an expansion of tarmac delay regulations to international airlines. 
The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and
imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per-ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. 
The results of our operations, demand for air travel, and the manner in which we conduct business each may be
affected by changes in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies, including:   


 
•
 
 changes in law which affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particular markets and at particular airports, or the types of
fees that can be charged to passengers;   


 
•
 
 the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including antitrust or foreign government approvals) needed for codesharing
alliances, joint businesses and other arrangements with other airlines; 
  24



Table of Contents


 
•
 
 restrictions on competitive practices (for example, court orders, or agency regulations or orders, that would curtail an airline’s
ability to respond to a competitor);   


 
•
 
 the adoption of new passenger security standards or regulations that impact customer service standards (for example, a “passenger bill of
rights”);   


 
•
 
 restrictions on airport operations, such as restrictions on the use of slots at airports or the auction or reallocation of slot rights
currently held by us; and   


 
•
 
 the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions. 
Each additional regulation or other form of regulatory oversight increases costs and adds greater complexity to
airline operations and, in some cases, may reduce the demand for air travel. There can be no assurance that our compliance with new rules, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight will not have a material adverse effect on us.
 Any significant reduction in air traffic capacity at and in the airspace serving key airports in the
U.S. or overseas could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the United States National Airspace System (the ATC system) is not successfully managing the growing demand for U.S.
air travel. Air traffic controllers rely on outdated procedures and technologies that are routinely overwhelmed and compel airlines to fly inefficient routes or take significant delays on the ground. The ATC system’s inability to handle
existing travel demand has led government agencies to implement short-term capacity constraints during peak travel periods or adverse weather conditions in certain markets, resulting in delays and disruptions of air traffic. The outdated
technologies also cause the ATC to be less resilient in the event of a failure. For example, in 2014 the ATC systems in Chicago took weeks to recover following a fire in the ATC tower at ORD, which resulted in thousands of cancelled flights.
 The FAA has embarked on transforming the national airspace system, to include migration from the
current radar-based air traffic control system to a GPS-based system. This ATC modernization, generally referred to as “NextGen,” has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and it remains
uncertain when the full array of benefits expected from ATC modernization will be available to the public and the airlines. Failure to update the ATC system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements that may be imposed on airlines
of a modernized ATC system may have a material adverse effect on our business. We support legislative efforts that would establish a nimble not-for-profit entity better
suited to manage the long-term investments in technology and provide a governance structure needed to successfully implement NextGen and improve the operation of the air traffic control system. 
Our operating authority in international markets is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the
respective countries or governmental authorities, such as the EU, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. Moreover, alliances with international carriers may be subject to the
jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. Bilateral and multilateral agreements among the U.S. and various foreign governments of countries we serve are subject to periodic renegotiation. We currently operate a number of
international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of airlines permitted to operate on the route, the capacity of the airlines providing services on the route, or the number of airlines allowed access to particular airports. If
an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these routes, such an event could have a material adverse impact on us and could result in the impairment of material amounts of our related tangible and intangible assets. In addition, competition
from revenue-sharing joint ventures, JBAs, and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of our business and assets on the open skies routes. For example, the open skies air services agreement between the U.S.
and the EU, which took effect in March 2008, 
  25



Table of Contents

provides airlines from the U.S. and EU member states open access to each other’s markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly from the U.S. to any airport in the EU,
including LHR. As a result of the agreement, we face increased competition in these markets, including LHR. Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value
of route authorities, slots or other assets located abroad, or otherwise adversely affect our international operations. The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted route
authority access between the U.S. and the foreign markets. While the U.S. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of markets important to us, including China, do not have open skies
agreements.  The airline industry is heavily taxed. 
The airline industry is subject to extensive government fees and taxation that negatively impact our revenue and
profitability. The U.S. airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed of all industries. These fees and taxes have grown significantly in the past decade for domestic flights, and various U.S. fees and taxes also are assessed on international
flights. For example, as permitted by federal legislation, most major U.S. airports impose a passenger facility charge per passenger on us. In addition, the governments of foreign countries in which we operate impose on U.S. airlines, including us,
various fees and taxes, and these assessments have been increasing in number and amount in recent years. Moreover, we are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the “ticket tax,” on domestic and international
air transportation. We collect the excise tax, along with certain other U.S. and foreign taxes and user fees on air transportation (such as passenger security fees), and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies.
Although these taxes and fees are not operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. There are continuing efforts in Congress and in other countries to raise different portions of the various taxes, fees, and charges imposed
on airlines and their passengers, and we may not be able to recover all of these charges from our customers. Increases in such taxes, fees and charges could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Under DOT regulations, all governmental taxes and fees must be included in the prices we quote or advertise to our
customers. Due to the competitive revenue environment, many increases in these fees and taxes have been absorbed by the airline industry rather than being passed on to the customer. Further increases in fees and taxes may reduce demand for air
travel, and thus our revenues.  Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be
successful and may cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.  We have recently
instituted, and intend to institute in the future, changes to our business model to increase revenues and offset costs. These measures include premium economy service, basic economy service and charging separately for services that had previously
been included within the price of a ticket and increasing other pre-existing fees. We may introduce additional initiatives in the future; however, as time goes on, we expect that it will be more difficult to
identify and implement additional initiatives. We cannot assure you that these measures or any future initiatives will be successful in increasing our revenues. Additionally, the implementation of these initiatives may create logistical challenges
that could harm the operational performance of our airline. Also, any new and increased fees might reduce the demand for air travel on our airline or across the industry in general, particularly if weakened economic conditions make our customers
more sensitive to increased travel costs or provide a significant competitive advantage to other carriers that determine not to institute similar charges. 
  26

The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the
inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.  We
believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain or attract highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified
personnel. Any inability to retain or attract significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks; the travel industry continues to face ongoing
security concerns.  Acts of terrorism or fear of such attacks, including elevated national threat
warnings, wars or other military conflicts, may depress air travel, particularly on international routes, and cause declines in revenues and increases in costs. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and continuing terrorist threats, attacks and
attempted attacks materially impacted and continue to impact air travel. Increased security procedures introduced at airports since the attacks of September 11, 2001 and any other such measures that may be introduced in the future generate
higher operating costs for airlines. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated improved flight deck security, deployment of federal air marshals on board flights, improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security
training, enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, additional provision of passenger data to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection
Agency and enhanced background checks. A concurrent increase in airport security charges and procedures, such as restrictions on carry-on baggage, has also had and may continue to have a disproportionate
impact on short-haul travel, which constitutes a significant portion of our flying and revenue. Implementation of and compliance with increasingly-complex security and customs requirements will continue to result in increased costs for us and our
passengers, and have caused and likely will continue to cause periodic service disruptions and delays. We have at times found it necessary or desirable to make significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while seeking to
reduce their impact on our customers, such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. As a result of competitive pressure, and the need to improve security screening throughput to support the pace of our operations, it is
unlikely that we will be able to capture all security-related costs through increased fares. In addition, we cannot forecast what new security requirements may be imposed in the future, or their impact on our business. 
We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have
been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control.  We operate a global business with operations outside of the U.S. Our current international activities and prospects have been and in the future could be adversely affected by reversals or delays in
the opening of foreign markets, increased competition in international markets, the performance of our alliance, joint business and codeshare partners in a given market, exchange controls or other restrictions on repatriation of funds, currency and
political risks (including changes in exchange rates and currency devaluations), environmental regulation, increases in taxes and fees and changes in international government regulation of our operations, including the inability to obtain or retain
needed route authorities and/or slots. In particular, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, exchange controls and other restrictions on the repatriation of funds, have significantly affected and may continue to significantly
affect our operating performance, liquidity and the value of any cash held outside the U.S. in local currency. 
  27



Table of Contents
Generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations,
cannot be predicted by us and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The United Kingdom held a
referendum in June 2016 regarding its membership in the EU in which a majority of the United Kingdom electorate voted in favor of the British government taking the necessary action for the United Kingdom to leave the EU. At this time, it is not
certain what steps will need to be taken to facilitate the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU or the length of time, expected to be measured in years, that this may take. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject
to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. The implications of the United Kingdom withdrawing from the EU are similarly unclear at present because it
is unclear what relationship the United Kingdom will have with the EU after withdrawal. We face risks associated with the uncertainty following the referendum and the consequences that may flow from the decision to exit the EU. Among other things,
the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU could adversely affect European or worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to further instability in global financial markets. In addition, the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU
could lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty and potentially divergent treaties, laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU treaties, laws and regulations to replace or replicate, including those governing aviation, labor,
environmental, data protection/privacy, competition and other matters applicable to the provision of air transportation services by us or our alliance, joint business or codeshare partners. The impact on our business of any treaties, laws and
regulations that replace the existing EU counterparts cannot be predicted. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We are subject to many forms of environmental and noise regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result.
 We are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and
ordinances relating to the protection of the environment and noise reduction, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the management of hazardous substances, oils and
waste materials. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties. 
We are also subject to other environmental laws and regulations, including those that require us to investigate and
remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under federal law, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at
locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the
amount of waste directly attributable to us. We have liability for investigation and remediation costs at various sites, although such costs currently are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. 
We have various leases and agreements with respect to real property, tanks and pipelines with airports and other
operators. Under these leases and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the lessor or operator against environmental liabilities associated with the real property or operations described under the agreement, in some cases even if we are not the
party responsible for the initial event that caused the environmental damage. We also participate in leases with other airlines in fuel consortiums and fuel committees at airports, where such indemnities are generally joint and several among the
participating airlines.

Governmental authorities in several U.S. and foreign cities are also
considering, or have already implemented, aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews and limitations on daytime take offs and landings. We have been able to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date,
but our operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread. 
We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation to reduce emissions of greenhouse
gases.  There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and GHG emissions. For
example, in October 2016, ICAO passed a resolution adopting the CORSIA, which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. The CORSIA was supported by the board of Airlines For America (the
principal U.S. airline trade association) and IATA (the principal international airline trade association), and by American and many other U.S. and foreign airlines. The CORSIA will increase operating costs for American and most other airlines,
including other U.S. airlines that operate internationally, but the implementation of a global program, as compared to regional emission reduction schemes, should help to ensure that these costs will be more predictable and more evenly applied to
American and its competitors. The CORSIA is expected to be implemented in phases, beginning in 2021. Certain details still need to be developed and the impact of the CORSIA cannot be fully predicted. While we do not anticipate any significant
emissions allowance expenditures in 2017, compliance with the CORSIA or similar emissions-related requirements could significantly increase our operating costs beyond 2017. Further, the potential impact of the CORSIA or other emissions-related
requirements on our costs will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including baseline emissions, the price of emission allowances or offsets and the number of future flights subject to such emissions-related requirements. These costs have not
been completely defined and could fluctuate.  In addition, in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of
the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC’s COP21), over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. While there is no express reference to
aviation in this international agreement, to the extent the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations, either with respect to the aviation industry or with respect to related industries
such as the aviation fuel industry, it could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business. 
The EPA recently issued an endangerment finding that aircraft engine GHG emissions cause or contribute to air
pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, which is a precursor to EPA regulation of aircraft engine GHG emission standards. It is anticipated that any such standards established by the EPA would closely align
with emission standards currently being developed by ICAO. In February 2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection recommended that ICAO adopt carbon dioxide certification standards that would apply to new type aircraft certified
beginning in 2020, and would be phased in for newly manufactured existing aircraft type designs starting in 2023.  In addition, several states have adopted or are considering initiatives to regulate emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emissions inventories and/or regional GHG cap
and trade programs. Depending on the scope of such regulation, certain of our facilities and operations, or the operations of our suppliers, may be subject to additional operating and other permit requirements, likely resulting in increased
operating costs.  These regulatory efforts, both internationally and in the U.S. at the federal and
state levels, are still developing, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in 
  29

the U.S., the EU or in other areas in which we do business. However, such climate change-related regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by
requiring us to reduce our emissions, purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions. Such activity may also impact us indirectly by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs. 
We rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these technologies or systems
could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We are highly dependent
on technology and automated systems to operate our business. These technologies and systems include our computerized airline reservation system, flight operations systems, financial planning, management and accounting systems, telecommunications
systems, website, maintenance systems and check-in kiosks. In order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain
secure information and deliver flight information, as well as issue electronic tickets and process critical financial information in a timely manner. Substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets. We depend on our
reservation system, which is hosted and maintained under a long-term contract by a third-party service provider, to be able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets. If our automated systems are not functioning or if our third-party
service providers were to fail to adequately provide technical support, system maintenance or timely software upgrades for any one of our key existing systems, we could experience service disruptions or delays, which could harm our business and
result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses and decrease our revenues. In the event that one or more of our primary technology or systems vendors goes into bankruptcy, ceases operations or fails to perform as promised, replacement
services may not be readily available on a timely basis, at competitive rates or at all, and any transition time to a new system may be significant.  Our automated systems cannot be completely protected against other events that are beyond our control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, data theft,
equipment and software failures, computer viruses or telecommunications failures. Substantial or sustained system failures could cause service delays or failures and result in our customers purchasing tickets from other airlines. We cannot assure
you that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans are adequate to prevent disruptions or delays. Disruption in or changes to these systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important
data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We face challenges in integrating our computer, communications and other technology systems.  Among the principal risks of integrating our businesses and operations are the risks relating to integrating various computer, communications and other technology systems that will be necessary to
operate US Airways and American as a single airline and to achieve cost synergies by eliminating redundancies in the businesses. While we have to date successfully integrated several of our systems, including our customer reservations system and our
pilot and fleet scheduling system, we still have to complete several additional important system integration projects. The integration of these systems in a number of prior airline mergers has taken longer, been more disruptive and cost more than
originally forecast. The implementation process to integrate these various systems will involve a number of risks that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. New systems will replace multiple legacy
systems and the related implementation will be a complex and time-consuming project involving substantial expenditures for implementation consultants, system hardware, software and implementation activities, as well as the transformation of business
and financial processes.

We cannot assure you that our security measures, change control
procedures or disaster recovery plans will be adequate to prevent disruptions or delays in connection with systems integration or replacement. Disruptions in or changes to these systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of
important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft or the aircraft of our regional or codeshare operators. 
If one of our aircraft, an aircraft that is operated under our brand by one of our regional operators, or an
aircraft that is operated by an airline with which we have a marketing alliance, joint business or codeshare relationship were to be involved in an accident, incident or catastrophe, we could be exposed to significant tort liability. The insurance
we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate. In the event that our insurance is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. In addition, any accident, incident or catastrophe
involving an aircraft operated by us, operated under our brand by one of our regional operators or operated by one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft or those of our regional operators or codeshare partners
are not safe or reliable, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft or those of our regional operators or codeshare partners, and adversely impact our business, results of operations and
financial condition.  Delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of anticipated fleet capacity, and
failure of new aircraft to perform as expected, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The success of our business depends on, among other things, effectively managing the number and types of aircraft we operate. In many cases, the aircraft we intend to operate are not yet in our
fleet, but we have contractual commitments to purchase or lease them. If for any reason we were unable to accept or secure deliveries of new aircraft on contractually scheduled delivery dates, this could have a negative impact on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to integrate newly purchased aircraft into our fleet as planned might require us to seek extensions of the terms for some leased aircraft or otherwise delay the exit of certain aircraft from
our fleet. Such unanticipated extensions or delays may require us to operate existing aircraft beyond the point at which it is economically optimal to retire them, resulting in increased maintenance costs. If new aircraft orders are not filled on a
timely basis, we could face higher operating costs than planned. In addition, if the aircraft we receive do not meet expected performance or quality standards, including with respect to fuel efficiency and reliability, our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.  We depend on a limited number of suppliers for
aircraft, aircraft engines and parts.  We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft,
aircraft engines and many aircraft and engine parts. As a result, we are vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft, parts and engines, including design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by the
suppliers, or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft.

Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic
and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality. 
Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be affected by many
changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:   


 
•
 
 actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession,
inflation, higher interest rates, wars, terrorist attacks and political instability;   


 
•
 
 changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns and demographic trends; 
 


 
•
 
 changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations, and other factors;
  


 
•
 
 actual or potential disruptions to the ATC systems; 
 


 
•
 
 increases in costs of safety, security, and environmental measures; 
 


 
•
 
 outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; and 
 


 
•
 
 weather and natural disasters.  In particular, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, Zika virus or any
other similar illness, if it were to become associated with air travel or persist for an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers’ travel
behavior. As a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition, due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues
in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year. 
A higher than normal number of pilot retirements, more stringent duty time regulations, increased flight hour requirements
for commercial airline pilots and other factors have caused a shortage of pilots which could materially adversely affect our business.  We currently have a higher than normal number of pilots eligible for retirement. Among other things, the extension of pilot careers facilitated by the FAA’s 2007 modification of the mandatory
retirement age from age 60 to age 65 has now been fully implemented, resulting in large numbers of pilots in the industry approaching the revised mandatory retirement age. Further, in July 2013, the FAA issued regulations that increased the flight
hours required for pilots working for airlines certificated under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. In addition, on January 4, 2014, more stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under Part 117 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations took effect. These and other factors, including reductions in the number of military pilots being trained by the U.S. armed forces and available as commercial pilots upon their retirement from military service, have contributed to a
shortage of qualified, entry-level pilots and increased compensation costs, particularly for our regional subsidiaries and our other regional partners who are being required by market conditions to pay significantly increased wages and large signing
bonuses to their pilots in an attempt to achieve desired staffing levels. The foregoing factors have also led to increased competition from large, mainline carriers to hire pilots to replace retiring pilots. We believe that this industry-wide pilot
shortage is becoming an increasing problem for airlines in the United States. Our regional partners have recently been unable to hire adequate numbers of pilots to meet their needs, resulting in a reduction in the number of flights offered,
disruptions, increased costs of operations, financial difficulties and other adverse effects, and these circumstances may become more severe in the future and thereby cause a material adverse effect on our business.

Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely
impact our operations and financial results.  The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001
led to a significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers. Accordingly, our insurance costs increased significantly, and our ability to continue to obtain insurance even at
current prices remains uncertain. If we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact
the claims paying ability of some insurers. Future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost. Because of competitive pressures in our industry, our
ability to pass along additional insurance costs to passengers is limited. As a result, further increases in insurance costs or reductions in available insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial results. 
We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and
liquidity.  From time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings,
claims and government inspections or investigations and other legal matters, both inside and outside the United States, arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims
that have not yet been fully resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which
are not within our control. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Although we will vigorously defend ourselves in such legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution
and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain. For these and other reasons, we may choose to settle legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their actual merit. If a legal proceeding is resolved against us, it could result in
significant compensatory damages, and in certain circumstances punitive or trebled damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief imposed on us. If our existing insurance does not cover the amount or
types of damages awarded, or if other resolution or actions taken as a result of the legal proceeding were to restrain our ability to operate or market our services, our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be
materially adversely affected. In addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business. Additional information regarding certain
legal matters in which we are involved can be found in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings.  Our ability to utilize
our NOL Carryforwards may be limited.  Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
Code), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses (NOLs) carried over from prior taxable years (NOL Carryforwards). As of December 31, 2016, we had available NOL Carryforwards of approximately $10.5 billion for
regular federal income tax purposes which will expire, if unused, beginning in 2022, and approximately $3.7 billion for state income tax purposes which will expire, if unused, between 2017 and 2036. Our NOL Carryforwards are subject to
adjustment on audit by the Internal Revenue Service and the respective state taxing authorities.  A
corporation’s ability to deduct its federal NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the Code (Section 382) if it
undergoes an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material stockholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period). We experienced an ownership change
in connection with our emergence 
  33



Table of Contents

from the Chapter 11 Cases and US Airways Group experienced an ownership change in connection with the Merger. The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where
the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. We elected to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that permitted approximately $9.0 billion (with $8.9 billion of unlimited NOL still remaining at
December 31, 2016) of our federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382. If the special rules are determined not to apply, our ability to utilize such federal NOL
Carryforwards may be subject to limitation. Substantially all of our remaining federal NOL Carryforwards (attributable to US Airways Group and its subsidiaries) are subject to limitation under Section 382 as a result of the Merger; however, our
ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an ownership change subsequent to our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases may
severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards and other tax attributes. To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards, our Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (Certificate of Incorporation) contains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial stockholders. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of AAG common stock to dispose of or acquire shares of
AAG common stock. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an ownership change from occurring, no assurance can be given that an ownership change will not occur even with these restrictions in place. 
Our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards also will depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future
periods. The NOL Carryforwards may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use them.  We have a
significant amount of goodwill, which is assessed for impairment at least annually. In addition, we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing us to record material impairment charges. 
Goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for impairment at least annually. In accordance with applicable
accounting standards, we are required to assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. In addition, we are required to assess certain
of our other long-lived assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred.  Future impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets could be recorded in results of operations as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates, or circumstances, some of which are beyond our
control. There can be no assurance that a material impairment charge of goodwill or tangible or intangible assets will be avoided. The value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. Such
changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by us or other airlines. An impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 The price of AAG common stock has recently been and may in the future be volatile. 
The market price of AAG common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are
beyond our control, including:   


 
•
 
 AAG’s operating and financial results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors; 
 


 
•
 
 changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; 
  34

•
 
 material announcements by us or our competitors; 
 


 
•
 
 movements in fuel prices;   


 
•
 
 expectations regarding our capital deployment program, including our share repurchase program and any future dividend payments that may be
declared by our Board of Directors;   


 
•
 
 new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;

 general and industry-specific economic conditions; 
 


 
•
 
 the success or failure of AAG’s integration efforts; 
 


 
•
 
 changes in our key personnel;   


 
•
 
 distributions of shares of AAG common stock pursuant to the Plan, including distributions from the disputed claims reserve established under
the plan of reorganization upon the resolution of the underlying claims;   


 
•
 
 public sales of a substantial number of shares of AAG common stock or issuances of AAG common stock upon the exercise or conversion of
convertible securities, options, warrants, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, or similar rights;   


 
•
 
 increases or decreases in reported holdings by insiders or other significant stockholders; 
 


 
•
 
 fluctuations in trading volume; and   


 
•
 
 changes in market values of airline companies as well as general market conditions. 
We cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs or continue to pay
dividends on our common stock or that our capital deployment program will enhance long-term stockholder value. Our capital deployment program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves.
 Since July 2014 and through December 31, 2016, as part of our capital deployment program,
we expended an aggregate of $9.0 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock under several share repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors, and in January 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2.0 billion share
repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2018. Share repurchases under our share repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or
accelerated share repurchase transactions. These share repurchase programs do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period, and may be suspended at any time at our
discretion. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The repurchase programs may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time
without prior notice.  Although our Board of Directors commenced declaring quarterly cash dividends in
July 2014 as part of our capital deployment program, any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not
obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and payment of dividends may be suspended at any time at our discretion. We will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate on a quarterly
basis the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements and general business conditions. The amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does
not assure that we will be able to pay dividends in the future.  In addition, repurchases of AAG common
stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs and any future dividends could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share 
  35



Table of Contents

repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our
share repurchase programs and any future dividends will diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Further, our share repurchase programs
may fluctuate such that our cash flow may be insufficient to fully cover our share repurchases. Although our share repurchase programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market
price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness. 
Certain provisions of AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws make it difficult for stockholders to change the
composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of our stockholders might consider beneficial.  Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (Bylaws) may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board of Directors
determines that such changes in control are not in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things, the following: 
 


 
•
 
 advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholders’ meetings; 
 


 
•
 
 the ability of our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the board; 
 


 
•
 
 a prohibition against stockholders taking action by written consent; 
 


 
•
 
 a prohibition against stockholders calling special meetings of stockholders; 
 


 
•
 
 a requirement that holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors approve any
amendment of our Bylaws submitted to stockholders for approval; and   


 
•
 
 super-majority voting requirements to modify or amend specified provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation. 
These provisions are not intended to prevent a takeover, but are intended to protect and maximize the value of the
interests of our stockholders. While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable our Board of Directors to prevent a transaction that
some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits business combinations with interested stockholders. Interested stockholders do not include stockholders whose acquisition of our securities is approved by the Board of Directors prior to the
investment under Section 203.  AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions that
limit voting and acquisition and disposition of our equity interests.  Our Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws include certain provisions that limit voting and ownership and disposition of our equity interests. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of AAG common stock and our other equity interests to
vote such interests and adversely affect the ability of persons to acquire shares of AAG common stock and our other equity interests.

Flight Equipment and Fleet Renewal  As of December 31, 2016, American operated a mainline fleet of 930 aircraft. In 2016, we continued our extensive fleet renewal program, which has provided us with the youngest fleet of the
major U.S. network carriers. During 2016, American took delivery of 55 new mainline aircraft and retired 71 aircraft. We are supported by our wholly-owned and third-party regional carriers that fly under capacity purchase agreements operating as
American Eagle. As of December 31, 2016, American Eagle operated 606 regional aircraft. During 2016, we increased our regional fleet by 61 regional aircraft, we removed and placed in temporary storage one Embraer ERJ 140 aircraft and retired 41
other regional aircraft.  Mainline

 These aircraft may be operated by wholly-owned regional subsidiaries or leased to third-party regional carriers which would operate the
aircraft under capacity purchase arrangements.  We also have agreements for 42 spare
engines to be delivered in 2017 and beyond.  We do not have financing commitments for the following
aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered through 2017: 12 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, nine Airbus A320 family aircraft, eight Boeing 787 family aircraft and four Boeing 737 MAX family aircraft.
In addition, we do not have financing commitments in place for substantially all aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered in 2018 and beyond. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors –“We will need to obtain sufficient
financing or other capital to operate successfully” for additional discussion.  See Note 11 to
AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 9 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on aircraft and engine acquisition commitments. 
Other Information  For information concerning the estimated useful lives and residual values for owned aircraft and terms for leased aircraft, see Note 1 and Note 11 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in
Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 and Note 9 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.  Ground Properties
 At each airport where we conduct flight operations, we lease passenger, operations and baggage
handling space, generally from the airport operator, but in some cases on a subleased basis from other airlines. Our agreements with airports also provide for the non-exclusive use of runways, taxiways and
other improvements and facilities; landing fees under these agreements typically are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft. These leases and use agreements generally contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates,
landing fees and other charges applicable under that type of agreement. Additionally, our main operational facilities are associated with our hubs. At these locations and in other cities we serve, we maintain administrative offices, catering, cargo,
training, maintenance and other facilities, in each case as necessary to support our operations in the particular city.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL
 PROCEEDINGS  Chapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011, AMR, American, and certain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the
Debtors’ fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the Merger. 
Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG
common stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 25.2 million shares of AAG common stock remaining in the
Disputed Claims Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the Effective Date. However, we are
not required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent that any of the reserved
shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to us but rather will be distributed to former AMR stockholders. 
There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to
seek a determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated without liability to American. On April 18, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court
granted American’s motion for summary judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary judgment motion was denied
with respect to all other retirees. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits concerning whether those retirees’ benefits are vested, and American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from obligations to provide
benefits to any of those retirees. Our financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or termination of benefits that may ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome of this
proceeding.  DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand. In June 2015, we received a Civil
Investigative Demand (CID) from the DOJ as part of an investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information from us, and other airlines have announced
that they have received similar requests. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, we, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines,
Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been
consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On October 28, 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ investigation and these lawsuits are in
their relatively early stages and we intend to defend these matters vigorously.  Private Party
Antitrust Action. On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants US
Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint 
  41



Table of Contents

in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On
August 19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well
as claims similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the Fjord matter with the putative class
action lawsuits, which was denied on October 15, 2015. A jointly proposed schedule for the remainder of the case was submitted on September 7, 2016, which has not yet been accepted by the Bankruptcy Court. We believe this lawsuit is
without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.  DOJ Investigation Related to
the United States Postal Service. In April 2015, the DOJ informed us of an inquiry regarding American’s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air. In October 2015, we
received a CID from the DOJ seeking certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is investigating
potential violations of the False Claims Act or other statutes. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its investigation.  General. In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be
complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control. Therefore, although we will vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions
described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain but could be material. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors –“We may be a party to
litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity” for additional discussion.

Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2016, there was no remaining authority to
repurchase shares under our existing share repurchase programs. However, in January 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2018, bringing the total amount authorized
for share repurchase programs since July 2014 to $11.0 billion.  Share repurchases under the
repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time
subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. 
Separate from our share repurchase programs, during 2016, we also withheld approximately 1.4 million shares of
AAG common stock and paid approximately $56 million in satisfaction of certain tax withholding obligations associated with employee equity awards.  Ownership Restrictions  AAG’s Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that, consistent with the requirements of Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code, as amended (the Aviation Act), any persons or entities who are not a “citizen of the United States” (as
defined under the Aviation Act and administrative interpretations issued by the DOT, its predecessors and successors, from time to time), including any agent, trustee or representative of such persons or entities (a
non-citizen), shall not, in the aggregate, own (beneficially or of record) and/or control more than (a) 24.9% of the aggregate votes of all of our outstanding equity securities or (b) 49.0% of our outstanding
equity securities. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws further specify that it is the duty of each stockholder who is a non-citizen to register his, her or its equity securities on our foreign stock
record and provide for remedies applicable to stockholders that exceed the voting and ownership caps described above.  In addition, to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards and certain other tax attributes for federal income tax purposes, our Certificate of
Incorporation contains certain restrictions on the acquisition and disposition of our common stock by substantial stockholders (generally holders of more than 4.75%). 
See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
include provisions that limit voting and acquisition and disposition of our equity interests.” Also see AAG’s Certification of Incorporation and Bylaws, which are filed as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2 hereto, for the full text of the foregoing

ITEM 6.  SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA
 Selected Consolidated Financial Data of AAG 
The selected consolidated financial data presented below under the captions “Consolidated Statements of
Operations data” and “Consolidated Balance Sheet data” for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are derived from AAG’s audited consolidated financial statements. On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary
of AMR merged with and into US Airways Group, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG. Therefore, AAG’s consolidated financial data provided in the tables below includes the results of US Airways Group beginning on December 9,
2013, the effective date of the Merger. In addition, AAG emerged from bankruptcy on December 9, 2013. Accordingly, AAG’s consolidated financial information for periods prior to December 9, 2013 is not directly comparable to
consolidated financial information for periods subsequent to December 9, 2013.

realized or incurred as a direct result of bankruptcy.   


(2) 

 Former holders of AMR common stock as of December 9, 2013, the effective date of the plan of reorganization, may in the future receive
additional distributions of AAG common stock dependent upon the ultimate distribution of shares of AAG common stock to holders of disputed claims. Thus, the shares and related earnings per share calculations prior to December 9, 2013 may change
in the future to reflect these distributions.   


(3) 

 Substantially all defined benefit pension plans were frozen effective November 1, 2012. See Note 9 to AAG’s consolidated financial
statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information on pension and postretirement benefits.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 We are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported
non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis.  The following table presents the components of our total special items and the reconciliation of pre-tax income and net income (GAAP measures) to pre-tax income excluding special items and net income excluding special items (non-GAAP measures). We believe that the non-GAAP
financial measures provide investors the ability to measure financial performance excluding special items, which is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines.

included share-based compensation related to awards granted in connection with the Merger that fully vested in December 2015. 
 


(3) 

 Fleet restructuring costs included the acceleration of aircraft depreciation, impairments, remaining lease payments and lease return costs for
aircraft currently grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.   


(4) 

 In 2014 and 2015, there was no net tax effect associated with special items. During 2014 and 2015, our net deferred tax asset, which includes
our NOLs, was subject to a full valuation allowance. Accordingly, our NOLs offset our taxable income and resulted in the release of a corresponding portion of valuation allowance, which offset the tax provision dollar for dollar.
 The following table presents the reconciliation of mainline operating expenses (GAAP
measure) to mainline operating costs excluding special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure). We believe that the presentation of mainline costs per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel is useful to investors
as both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control. The exclusion of special items from mainline CASM provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more
indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel to evaluate its operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to
rounding.

transfer of assets between entities under common control and is reflected in American’s consolidated financial statements as though the transaction had occurred on December 9, 2013,
when a subsidiary of AMR merged with and into US Airways Group, which represents the earliest date that American and US Airways were under common control. Therefore, American’s consolidated financial data provided in the tables below includes
the results of US Airways beginning on December 9, 2013. In addition, American emerged from bankruptcy on December 9, 2013. Accordingly, American’s consolidated financial information for periods prior to December 9, 2013 is not

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Background 
Together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American
Eagle, our airline operates an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries, principally from our hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and
Washington, D.C. In 2016, approximately 199 million passengers boarded our mainline and regional flights.  We are committed to consistently delivering safe, reliable and convenient service to our customers in every aspect of our operation, to building the best employee relations in the industry and to
providing returns for our stockholders. In January 2017, we were named the 2017 Airline of the Year by Air Transport World, which cited the integration work related to the Merger, our operational and customer service improvements and the
investments we are making in our product.  Operational Highlights 
During 2016, we made significant investments related to our integration and to continue to improve our product
offerings and operational performance.  Integration Accomplishments 
 


 
•
 
 Integrated all mainline pilots and our mainline fleet into a single scheduling system, allowing us to schedule pilots and aircraft seamlessly
across the network regardless of which pre-Merger airline they came from   


 
•
 
 Reached interim agreements with the TWU-IAM that allows our mainline mechanics and ramp personnel to
be able to work together and be cross-utilized. Additionally, we ratified five-year JCBAs for dispatchers, flight crew training instructors, simulator pilot instructors and flight simulator engineers 
 


 
•
 
 Completed the painting of all US Airways mainline aircraft in the American livery. Repainting of former US Airways Express regional jets is
expected to be finished in mid-2017  Investments in Our Product and
Operations   


 
•
 
 Invested approximately $4.4 billion in new aircraft, including 55 new mainline and 42 new regional aircraft. As a result of our ongoing
fleet renewal program, we have the youngest fleet of the major U.S. network carriers   


 
•
 
 Hired additional personnel and invested in new equipment and technology to support our operations. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we achieved
our best monthly completion factor, on-time performance, and baggage handling performance since the Merger   


 
•
 
 Redesigned our AAdvantage® loyalty program to award mileage credits based on the price of tickets purchased, enabling elite members to earn even more miles based on their status level. During
2016, the AAdvantage® program was named Best Elite Program in the Americas by the Freddie Awards
  


 
•
 
 Introduced Premium Economy, a new class of service on international flights with more legroom, wider seats, and enhanced meal service and
amenity kits   


 
•
 
 Made several other customer experience improvements including the reintroduction of free snacks in the main cabin, the launch of complimentary
in-flight entertainment and the redesign and upgrade of many Admirals Club lounges 
  50



Table of Contents
Investments in our People 
 


 
•
 
 Instituted a profit sharing program across all of our workgroups that pays 5% of our pre-tax profit
excluding special items ($314 million was accrued in 2016)   


 
•
 
 Announced industry-leading pay packages for pilots at our wholly-owned regional airlines Envoy, PSA and Piedmont in order to attract and
retain the best pilots  Financial Overview  The U.S. Airline Industry  In 2016, the
U.S. airline industry benefited from lower fuel prices. However, the reductions in fuel costs were offset by year-over-year declines in revenue. Both domestic and international markets were impacted by competitive capacity growth. International
markets were also impacted by macroeconomic softness and foreign currency weakness.  Jet fuel prices
closely follow the price of Brent crude oil. On average, the price of Brent crude oil per barrel was approximately 17% lower in 2016 as compared to 2015. The average daily spot price for Brent crude oil during 2016 was $44 per barrel as compared to
an average daily spot price of $52 per barrel during 2015. On a daily basis, Brent crude oil prices fluctuated during 2016 between a high of $55 per barrel to a low of $26 per barrel, and closed the year on December 31, 2016 at $55 per barrel.
 While jet fuel prices have declined year-over-year as described above, uncertainty exists regarding the
economic conditions driving these declines. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business” and “Our business is very dependent on the price and
availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and
liquidity.”  AAG’s 2016 Results 
The selected financial data presented below is derived from AAG’s audited consolidated financial statements
included in Part II, Item 8A of this report and should be read in conjunction with those financial statements and the related notes thereto.

 See Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data – “Reconciliation of GAAP to
Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Note 2 to AAG’s consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8A for details on the components of special items. 
Net Income and Pre-Tax Income 
We realized net income of $2.7 billion in 2016. This compares to $7.6 billion of net income in 2015, which
included a special $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit, as we reversed the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which include our federal and state NOLs. As a result of the reversal of the
valuation allowance, we recorded a $1.6 billion provision for income taxes in 2016, which is substantially non-cash due to the utilization of NOLs. Accordingly, amounts reported in 2016 for income tax
provision and net income are not comparable to 2015. Therefore, pre-tax income and pre-tax income excluding special items provides a more meaningful year-over-year
comparison. The exclusion of special items provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to financial measures presented by other major airlines.
Management uses pre-tax income excluding special items to evaluate our financial performance.  We realized pre-tax income of $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the effects of
pre-tax special items, pre-tax income was $5.1 billion and $6.3 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our 2016
pre-tax results on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were impacted by a decline in revenues due to lower yields. Salaries, wages and benefits
costs were higher in 2016, driven by our new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program; however, these increases were substantially offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs. 
For reconciliation of pre-tax and net income excluding special items to
their comparable measures on a GAAP basis, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data – “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” 
Revenue  In 2016, we reported operating revenues of $40.2 billion, a decrease of $810 million, or 2.0%, as compared to 2015. Mainline and regional passenger revenues were $34.6 billion, a
decrease of $933 million, or 2.6%, as compared to 2015. The decline in mainline and regional passenger revenues was due to lower yields driven by competitive capacity growth, macroeconomic softness outside of the United States and foreign
currency weakness. This decline was offset in part by an increase in other operating revenues primarily due to our new co-branded credit card agreements which became effective in the third quarter of 2016. Our
mainline and regional total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) was 14.70 cents in 2016, a 3.7% decrease as compared to 15.25 cents in 2015.  Fuel  Our mainline and regional fuel
expense totaled $6.2 billion in 2016, which was $1.3 billion, or 17.1%, lower as compared to 2015. This decrease was driven by a 17.6% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.42 in 2016 from $1.72 in 2015. 
As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption.
As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel
consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.

Other Costs 
We remain committed to actively managing our cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose
economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel.  Our 2016 mainline CASM was 11.94 cents, a decrease of 0.8%, from 12.03 cents in 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by lower fuel costs, offset in part by higher salaries, wages and benefits
associated with new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program.  Our 2016
mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel was 9.54 cents, an increase of 6.1%, from 8.99 cents in 2015, which was primarily driven by higher salaries, wages and benefits as described above. 
For a reconciliation of mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated
Financial Data – “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Liquidity and Stockholder Returns  As of
December 31, 2016, we had approximately $8.8 billion in total available liquidity, consisting of $6.4 billion in unrestricted cash and investments and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. We also had approximately
$638 million in restricted cash.  During 2016, we returned $4.6 billion to our stockholders,
including quarterly dividend payments of $224 million and the repurchase of $4.4 billion of common stock, or 119.8 million shares. Since our capital return program commenced in mid-2014, we have
returned more than $9.6 billion to stockholders including $646 million in quarterly dividends and $9.0 billion in share repurchases, or 228.4 million shares. In January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new
$2.0 billion share repurchase authorization that will expire December 31, 2018 and declared a dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid to stockholders of record as of February 13, 2017. 
We have taken advantage of historically low interest rates to finance our fleet renewal program. During 2016 to
finance new aircraft deliveries, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $2.8 billion in Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) equipment notes at an average fixed interest rate of 3.63%, as well as $1.8 billion in other equipment
notes, which bear interest at fixed and variable rates of LIBOR plus margin, averaging 2.96% at December 31, 2016. Additionally, we refinanced certain higher cost debt. See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item
8A for additional information on our debt obligations.  As a result of the foregoing factors, we
currently have a higher debt level and fewer unencumbered assets than our peers. Accordingly, we believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage as well as to protect against an adverse
economic shock. Our current plan is to maintain minimum total available liquidity of $7.0 billion. We were well above that minimum level at December 31, 2016.

Results of Operations – 2016 Compared to 2015 
We realized net income of $2.7 billion in 2016. This compares to $7.6 billion of net income in 2015, which
included a special $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit as we reversed the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which include our federal and state NOLs. As a result of the reversal of the
valuation allowance, we recorded a $1.6 billion provision for income taxes in 2016, which is substantially non-cash due to the utilization of NOLs. Accordingly, amounts reported in 2016 for income tax
provision and net income are not comparable to 2015.  We realized
pre-tax income of $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $5.1 billion and $6.3 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. For reconciliation of pre-tax and net income excluding special items to their
comparable measures on a GAAP basis, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data –“Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” 
Our 2016 pre-tax results on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were impacted by a decline in revenues due to lower yields. Salaries, wages and benefits costs were higher in 2016, driven by our new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit
sharing program; however, these increases were substantially offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs.

 Total passenger revenues declined $933 million, or 2.6%, in 2016 from 2015
driven by a 2.8% decrease in yield due to competitive capacity growth, macroeconomic softness outside of the United States and foreign currency weakness.  Cargo revenue decreased $60 million, or 7.9%, in 2016 from 2015 driven primarily by a decrease in domestic and international freight yields.

Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with our loyalty
program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. Other revenue increased $183 million, or 3.9%, in 2016 from 2015 driven by an increase in loyalty program revenue. In 2016 and 2015, other revenues associated with
our loyalty program were $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments. This year-over-year increase was
due to our new co-branded credit card agreements which became effective in the third quarter of 2016. See Note 1(i) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on the loyalty program.

 We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors because both the cost and availability of fuel are
subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and the exclusion of special items provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and that is more
comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding. 
Significant changes in the components of mainline operating cost per ASM are as follows: 
 


 
•
 
 Aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM decreased 19.3% primarily due to an 18.2% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.41 in
2016 from an average price per gallon of $1.72 in 2015.   


 
•
 
 Salaries, wages and benefits per ASM increased 13.2% primarily due to increased costs associated with new labor contracts and the addition of
an employee profit sharing program.   


 
•
 
 Selling expenses per ASM decreased 6.0% primarily due to lower credit card and booking fees. 
 


 
•
 
 Depreciation and amortization per ASM increased 10.7% primarily due to the effect of purchased aircraft deliveries in connection with our
fleet renewal program.

(3) 

 Regional operating special items, net are included within other regional operating expenses and principally related to Merger integration
costs.  Regional Operating Expenses 
Total regional expenses increased $61 million, or 1.0%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The year-over-year
increase was primarily due to a $182 million, or 3.8%, increase in other regional operating expenses driven by increased capacity. This was offset in part by a $121 million, or 9.8%, decrease in fuel costs. The decrease in fuel costs was
driven primarily by a 14.5% decline in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.48 in 2016 from $1.73 in 2015, offset in part by a 5.5% increase in gallons of fuel consumed. See Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II,
Item 8A for further information on regional expenses.  Nonoperating Results

 Our short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments
that provided nominal returns. Interest income increased $24 million, or 60.9%, principally due to a 50 basis point increase in average yields in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest increased in 2016 primarily due to issuances of aircraft-related financings associated with our fleet renewal program.

Table of Contents
In 2016, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included
$49 million of net special charges consisting of debt issuance and extinguishment costs associated with bond and term loan refinancings. Net foreign currency gains were nominal in 2016. 
In 2015, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included a $592 million special charge to write off all of
the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. We also incurred $159 million of net foreign currency losses. The foreign currency losses in 2015 were
driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, principally in Latin American and European markets.  Income Taxes  In 2016, we recorded a
$1.6 billion provision for income taxes at an effective rate of approximately 38%, which was substantially non-cash as we utilized our NOLs. Substantially all of our income before income taxes is
attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $10.5 billion of gross NOLs to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017. 
In 2015, we reversed $3.0 billion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which resulted in a
special non-cash tax benefit recorded in our consolidated statement of operations.  See Note 6 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on income taxes.  Results of Operations – 2015 Compared to 2014  We realized net income of $7.6 billion in 2015, which included a special $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit as we reversed the valuation allowance on
our deferred tax assets, which include our federal and state NOLs. We realized net income of $2.9 billion in 2014. As a result of the valuation allowance reversal, amounts reported in 2015 for income tax benefit and net income are not
comparable to 2014.  We realized pre-tax income of
$4.6 billion and $3.2 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $6.3 billion and
$4.2 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. For reconciliation of pre-tax and net income excluding special items to their comparable measures on a GAAP basis, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated
Financial Data –“Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Our 2015 pre-tax results on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were impacted by substantially
lower fuel costs in 2015 as compared to 2014, offset in part by a decline in revenues driven by lower yields.

 Total passenger revenues declined $1.6 billion, or 4.3%, in 2015 from 2014
driven by a 6.5% decrease in yield due to competitive growth in certain domestic markets, including Dallas/Fort Worth, international weakness resulting from foreign currency devaluation relative to the U.S. dollar, lower fuel surcharges and economic
softness in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Venezuela.  Cargo revenue decreased
$115 million, or 13.1%, in 2015 from 2014 driven primarily by a decrease in international freight yields.  Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with our loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. In 2015 and 2014, other revenues associated
with our loyalty program were each $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments. See Note 1(i) to
AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on the loyalty program.

 We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors because both the cost and availability of fuel are
subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and the exclusion of special items provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and that is more
comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding. 
Significant changes in the components of mainline operating cost per ASM are as follows: 
 


 
•
 
 Aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM decreased 41.7% primarily due to a 40.7% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.72 in
2015 from an average price per gallon of $2.91 in 2014.   


 
•
 
 Salaries, wages and benefits per ASM increased 11.1% primarily due to increased costs associated with new pilot, flight attendant and customer
service and reservation agent joint collective bargaining agreements.   


 
•
 
 Maintenance, materials and repairs per ASM decreased 8.6% primarily due to fewer engine overhauls in 2015, driven by our fleet renewal
program.   


 
•
 
 Selling expenses per ASM decreased 10.5% primarily due to lower contractually negotiated rates for certain commissions and booking fees as
well as lower revenues in 2015.   


 
•
 
 Other operating expenses per ASM increased 5.4% in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in crew travel and certain information
technology projects, as well as enhancements to our aircraft food and catering offerings.

(3) 

 Regional operating special items, net are included within other regional operating expenses and consisted primarily of a $24 million
charge due to a new pilot labor contract at our Envoy regional subsidiary.  Regional Operating
Expenses  Total regional expenses decreased $533 million, or 8.2%, in 2015 as compared to
2014. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a $779 million, or 38.8%, decrease in fuel costs, offset in part by a $246 million, or 5.4%, increase in other regional operating expenses. The average price per gallon of fuel
decreased 40.9% to $1.73 in 2015 from $2.92 in 2014. The increase in other regional operating expenses was principally due to increased flying under capacity purchase agreements. See Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II,

currency losses. The foreign currency losses in 2015 were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, principally in Latin American and European
markets.  In 2014, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included $114 million of net foreign
currency losses, including a $43 million special charge for Venezuelan foreign currency losses and $56 million of special charges primarily due to early debt extinguishment costs related to the prepayment of our 7.50% senior secured notes
and other indebtedness. The foreign currency losses in 2014 were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, principally in the Latin American market. 
Income Taxes  In 2015, we reversed $3.0 billion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in our
consolidated statement of operations.  In 2014, we recorded a $330 million provision for income
taxes, which included $346 million of special tax charges. During 2014, we sold our portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. As a result, a special $330 million non-cash tax provision was recorded, which is the tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of our fuel hedging contracts. 
See Note 6 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on income
taxes.  American’s Results of Operations  Results of Operations – 2016 Compared to 2015  American realized net income of $2.8 billion in 2016. This compares to $8.1 billion of net income in 2015, which included a special $3.5 billion
non-cash tax benefit as American reversed the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, which include its federal and state NOLs. As a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance, American recorded
a $1.7 billion provision for income taxes in 2016, which is substantially non-cash due to the utilization of NOLs. Accordingly, amounts reported in 2016 for income tax provision and net income are not
comparable to 2015.  American realized pre-tax income of
$4.4 billion and $4.7 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. American’s 2016 pre-tax income was impacted by a decline in revenues due to lower yields. Salaries, wages and benefits costs were
higher in 2016, driven by American’s new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program; however, these increases were substantially offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs.

Table of Contents
Total passenger revenues declined $933 million, or 2.6%, in 2016
from 2015 driven by a decrease in yield due to competitive capacity growth, macroeconomic softness outside of the United States and foreign currency weakness.  Cargo revenue decreased $60 million, or 7.9%, in 2016 from 2015 driven primarily by a decrease in domestic and international freight yields. 
Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with American’s loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing
change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. Other revenue increased $218 million, or 4.7%, in 2016 from 2015 driven by an increase in loyalty program revenue. In 2016 and 2015, other revenues associated with American’s loyalty program
were $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments. This year-over-year increase was due to American’s
new co-branded credit card agreements which became effective in the third quarter of 2016. See Note 1(i) to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on the loyalty program.

 Total operating expenses were $34.9 billion in 2016, an increase of
$110 million, or 0.3%, from 2015. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher salaries, wages and benefits driven by new labor contracts and the addition of an employee profit sharing program; however, these costs were substantially
offset by a year-over-year decline in fuel costs.  Significant changes in the components of mainline
operating expenses are as follows:   


 
•
 
 Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased 18.5% primarily due to an 18.2% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.41 in 2016
from an average price per gallon of $1.72 in 2015.   


 
•
 
 Salaries, wages and benefits increased 14.4% primarily due to increased costs associated with new labor contracts and the addition of an
employee profit sharing program.   


 
•
 
 Selling expenses decreased 5.0% primarily due to lower credit card and booking fees.

Total regional expenses increased $57 million, or 1.0%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The year-over-year
increase was primarily due to a $178 million, or 3.8%, increase in other regional operating expenses driven by increased capacity. This was offset in part by a $121 million, or 9.8%, decrease in fuel costs. The decrease in fuel costs was
driven primarily by a 14.5% decline in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.48 in 2016 from $1.73 in 2015, offset in part by a 5.5% increase in gallons of fuel consumed. See Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part

  65



Table of Contents
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest increased in 2016
primarily due to issuances of aircraft-related financings associated with American’s fleet renewal program.  In 2016, other nonoperating expense, net primarily included $49 million of net special charges consisting of debt issuance and extinguishment costs associated with bond and term loan
refinancings. Net foreign currency gains were nominal in 2016.  In 2015, other nonoperating expense, net
primarily included a $592 million special charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by American due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. American also incurred
$159 million of net foreign currency losses. The foreign currency losses in 2015 were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, principally in Latin American and European markets. 
Income Taxes  In 2016, American recorded a $1.7 billion provision for income taxes at an effective rate of approximately 37%, which was substantially non-cash as
American utilized its NOLs. Substantially all of American’s income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2016, American had approximately $11.3 billion of gross NOLs to reduce future federal taxable
income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017.  In 2015, American
reversed $3.5 billion of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in American’s consolidated statement of operations. 
See Note 4 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on
income taxes.  Results of Operations – 2015 Compared to 2014 
American realized net income of $8.1 billion in 2015, which included a special $3.5 billion non-cash tax benefit as American reversed the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, which include its federal and state NOLs. American realized net income of $2.9 billion in 2014. As a result of the
valuation allowance reversal, amounts reported in 2015 for income tax benefit and net income are not comparable to 2014.  American realized pre-tax income of $4.7 billion and $3.3 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. American’s 2015 pre-tax income was impacted by substantially lower fuel costs in 2015 as compared to 2014, offset in part by a decline in revenues driven by lower yields.

Table of Contents
Total passenger revenues declined $1.6 billion, or 4.3%, in 2015
from 2014 driven by a decrease in yield due to competitive growth in certain domestic markets, including Dallas/Fort Worth, international weakness resulting from foreign currency devaluation relative to the U.S. dollar, lower fuel surcharges and
economic softness in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Venezuela.  Cargo revenue decreased
$115 million, or 13.1%, in 2015 from 2014 driven primarily by a decrease in international freight yields.  Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with American’s loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. In 2015 and 2014, other revenues
associated with American’s loyalty program were $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments. See

 Total operating expenses were $34.7 billion in 2015, a decrease of

Significant changes in the components of mainline operating expenses are as follows: 
 


 
•
 
 Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased 41.2% primarily due to a 40.7% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.72 in 2015
from an average price per gallon of $2.91 in 2014.   


 
•
 
 Salaries, wages and benefits increased 11.9% primarily due to increased costs associated with new pilot, flight attendant and customer service
and reservation agent joint collective bargaining agreements.   


 
•
 
 Maintenance, materials and repairs decreased 7.9% primarily due to fewer engine overhauls in 2015, driven by American’s fleet renewal
program.

provision for income taxes, which included $344 million of special tax charges. During 2014, American sold its portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. As a result, a special
$328 million non-cash tax provision was recorded, which is the tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of American’s fuel hedging
contracts.  See Note 4 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for
additional information on income taxes.  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Liquidity  As of December 31, 2016, AAG had approximately $8.8 billion in total available liquidity and $638 million in restricted cash and short-term investments. Additional detail of our

 Sources and Uses of Cash 
AAG and American  2016 Compared to 2015  Operating Activities
 AAG’s net cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 billion and $6.2 billion in
2016 and 2015, respectively. While AAG’s profitability was lower in 2016 as compared to 2015, cash provided by operating activities increased $275 million driven by certain payments received related to our new co-branded credit card agreements that became effective in the third quarter of 2016. 
  69



Table of Contents
American’s net cash provided by operating activities was
$1.8 billion and $2.6 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively, a year-over-year decrease of $837 million. We have the ability to move funds freely between our subsidiaries to support our cash requirements. The decline in
American’s operating cash flows from 2016 to 2015 was primarily due to intercompany transfers of cash from American to AAG in order to fund higher share repurchases in 2016. Additionally, in 2015, American’s operating cash flows included
the proceeds from the $500 million issuance of AAG’s 4.625% senior notes, which also contributed to the year-over-year decline in operating cash flows. These declines were offset in part by the cash payments related to credit card
agreements discussed above.  Investing Activities 
AAG’s net cash used in investing activities was $5.7 billion and $5.6 billion in 2016 and 2015,
respectively. American’s net cash used in investing activities was $5.6 billion in each of 2016 and 2015.  AAG and American’s principal investing activities in 2016 each included expenditures of $5.7 billion for property and equipment, primarily 97 newly delivered aircraft, including 25 Airbus
A321 aircraft, 24 Embraer 175 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 18 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, eight Boeing 787 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft. We also had net purchases of $149 million of
short-term investments.  AAG and American’s principal investing activities in 2015 included
expenditures of $6.2 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, for property and equipment, primarily 114 newly delivered aircraft and eight spare engines, including 38 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 24 Embraer 175 aircraft, 20 Bombardier
CRJ900 aircraft, 17 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 13 Boeing 787 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft and the purchase of five Boeing 757 aircraft previously being leased. These cash outflows were offset in part by
$391 million in net sales of short-term investments.  Financing Activities 
AAG’s net cash used in financing activities was $894 million and $1.3 billion in 2016 and 2015,
respectively. American’s net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion and $2.4 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  AAG and American’s principal financing activities in 2016 each included proceeds of $7.7 billion from the issuance of debt, including the $2.8 billion issuance of EETCs by American,
the $2.3 billion provided under the April 2016 and December 2016 Credit Facilities, the issuance of $844 million of special facility revenue refunding bonds related to JFK and an additional $1.8 billion borrowed in connection with the
financing of certain aircraft. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $3.8 billion by AAG and American, primarily including the repayment of approximately $588 million and $970 million in remaining principal of
the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility Tranche B-2 and Tranche B-1 term loans, respectively, and the refunding of approximately $1.0 billion of special facility revenue
bonds related to JFK. In addition, AAG had cash outflows of $4.5 billion in share repurchases and $224 million in dividend payments.  AAG and American’s principal financing activities in 2015 included proceeds from the issuance of debt of $5.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, including the $2.3 billion
issuance of EETCs by American, the $500 million issuance of 4.625% senior notes by AAG and other aircraft-related financings. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $2.2 billion by AAG and American, including the
$400 million repayment of American’s AAdvantage loan with Citibank. In addition, AAG had cash outflows of $3.8 billion in share repurchases and $278 million in dividend payments.

2015 Compared to 2014 
Operating Activities  AAG’s net cash provided by operating activities was $6.2 billion and $3.1 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increased profitability driven by
substantially lower fuel costs. In addition, a decrease in pension contributions from $810 million in 2014 to $6 million in 2015 contributed to increased operating cash flows. Our 2015 profitability was negatively affected by a
$592 million charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. 
American’s net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion in each of 2015 and 2014. Cash
flows were generated from increased profitability, driven by substantially lower fuel costs and a decrease in pension contributions, which were offset in part by American’s funding of AAG’s share repurchase activities. American’s 2015
profitability was negatively affected by a $592 million charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by American due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. 
Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities was $5.6 billion and $2.9 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively, for both AAG and American. 
AAG and American’s principal investing activities in 2015 included expenditures of $6.2 billion and
$6.1 billion, respectively, for property and equipment, primarily 114 newly delivered aircraft and eight spare engines, including 38 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 24 Embraer 175 aircraft, 20 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, 17 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 13 Boeing 787 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft and five Boeing 757 aircraft previously being leased. These cash outflows were offset in part by $391 million in net sales of short-term
investments.  AAG and American’s principal investing activities in 2014 each included expenditures
of $5.3 billion for property and equipment, primarily 70 newly delivered aircraft, including 25 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 16 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, six Boeing 777
aircraft, and three Airbus A330 aircraft, the purchase of aircraft previously leased, including nine Airbus A320 family aircraft, three Airbus A330 aircraft and three Boeing 777 aircraft, as well as
pre-delivery deposits for certain aircraft on order. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.8 billion in net sales of short-term investments and $307 million in proceeds from the sale of DCA
slots.  Financing Activities 
AAG’s net cash used in financing activities was $1.3 billion and $315 million in 2015 and 2014,
respectively. American’s net cash provided by financing activities was $2.4 billion and $143 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  AAG and American’s principal financing activities in 2015 included proceeds from the issuance of debt of $5.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, including the $2.3 billion
issuance of EETCs by American, the $500 million issuance of 4.625% senior notes by AAG and other aircraft-related financings. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $2.2 billion by AAG and American, including the
$400 million repayment of American’s AAdvantage loan with Citibank. In addition, AAG had cash outflows of $3.8 billion in share repurchases and $278 million in dividend payments. 
AAG and American’s principal financing activities in 2014 included proceeds from the issuance of debt of
$3.3 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, including the $1.5 billion issuance of EETCs by American, $1.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% senior notes by AAG and the term

loan under the 2014 Credit Facilities, as well as $811 million of proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions related to the financing of 20 Boeing
737-800 aircraft. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $3.1 billion by AAG and $3.0 billion by American, including the $1.0 billion prepayment of American’s 7.50%
senior secured notes and the $366 million prepayment of certain airport facility revenue bonds. In addition, AAG had cash outflows of $1.1 billion in share repurchases and $144 million in dividend payments.

A decrease in our credit ratings could cause our borrowing costs to increase, which would increase our interest
expense and could affect our net income, and our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. If our financial performance or industry conditions worsen, we may face future downgrades, which could negatively
impact our borrowing costs and the prices of our equity or debt securities. In addition, any downgrade of our credit ratings may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other
contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as
equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development
arrangements with us.  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements
of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Certain guarantees that we do not expect to have a material current
or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations are disclosed in Note 11 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8A and Note 9 to American’s Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part II, Item 8B.

Table of Contents
Special Facility Revenue Bonds 
We guarantee the payment of principal and interest of certain special facility revenue bonds issued by
municipalities primarily to build or improve airport facilities and purchase equipment which are leased to us. Under such leases, we are required to make rental payments through 2035, sufficient to pay maturing principal and interest payments on the
related bonds. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining lease payments guaranteeing the principal and interest on these bonds are $605 million, which are accounted for as operating leases. 
Pass-Through Trusts  We have financed certain aircraft and engines with EETCs, issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of
which is to finance the acquisition of flight equipment. Rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American to raise the financing for a number of aircraft at one time
and, if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. The trusts were also structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain
interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.  Each trust covers a set number of aircraft scheduled to be delivered or refinanced upon the issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft
financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase equipment
notes relating to the financed aircraft. The equipment notes are issued, at American’s election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease
financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leases the aircraft to American. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft. The pass-through trust certificates
are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have been guaranteed by
AAG. As of December 31, 2016, $10.9 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
With respect to leveraged leases, American evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest
entity. American concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities. American generally is not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the
lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates American to absorb decreases in value or entitles American to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. American does not
provide residual value guarantees to the bondholders or equity participants in the trusts. Some leases have a fair market value or a fixed price purchase option that allows American to purchase the aircraft at or near the end of the lease term.
However, the option price approximates an estimate of the aircraft’s fair value at the option date. Under this feature, American does not participate in any increases in the value of the aircraft. American concluded it is not the primary
beneficiary under these arrangements. Therefore, American accounts for its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American’s total future obligations under these leveraged lease financings are $1.5 billion as of
December 31, 2016.

 Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs
based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and our actual payments could differ materially.   


(8) 

 Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and retiree medical and other postretirement benefit payments
and is based on estimated payments through 2026. The total pension contribution of $279 million in 2017 assumes a supplemental contribution of $254 million in addition to the $25 million minimum required contribution. See Note 9 to
AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 7 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on our minimum pension obligations. 
Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions  In light of our significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new aircraft and the servicing and amortization of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, we and our
subsidiaries will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity
securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by
operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks or natural disasters could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of
cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a general increase in interest rates, or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, or aircraft,
aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, certain of our financing arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of
our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements. See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding our financing arrangements.  In the
past, we have from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased our debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of our debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve our balance sheet. Going forward,
depending on market conditions, our cash position and other considerations, we may continue to take such actions.  OTHER
INFORMATION  Basis of Presentation 
See Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to American’s
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding the basis of presentation.  Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We believe our
estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in
materially different results under 
  75

different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See the “Basis of
Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B
for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.  Passenger Revenue
 Passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided. Ticket sales for transportation
that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of
tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in the air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. Our air traffic liability was $3.9 billion and $3.7 billion as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small
percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in passenger revenue using
estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis of our historical data. We and other airline industry participants have consistently
applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the
accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed. 
Loyalty Program  We currently operate the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the
services of other program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American or other
participating partner airlines.  We use the incremental cost method to account for the portion of our
loyalty program liability incurred when AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines. We have an obligation to provide future travel when these mileage credits are redeemed and
therefore have recorded a liability for mileage credits outstanding.  The incremental cost liability
includes all mileage credits, even mileage credits for members whose account balances have not yet reached the minimum level required to redeem an award. Mileage credits are subject to expiration. The liability for outstanding mileage credits is
valued based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. The estimated incremental cost primarily includes unit costs incurred for fuel, food and insurance as well as fees incurred when travel awards are redeemed on
partner airlines. In calculating the liability, we estimate how many mileage credits will never be redeemed for travel and exclude those mileage credits from the estimate of the liability. Estimates are also made for the number of miles that will be
used per award redemption and the number of travel awards that will be redeemed on partner airlines. These costs and estimates are based on our historical program experience as well as consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable. Changes
in the liability resulting from members earning additional mileage credits or changes in estimates are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a part of passenger revenue. 
  76



Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the liability for outstanding
mileage credits accounted for under the incremental cost method was $669 million and $657 million, respectively, and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within loyalty program liability. 
A change to certain estimates used in the calculation of incremental cost could have a material impact on the
liability. A one percentage point increase or decrease in the percentage of travel awards redeemed on partner airlines would have an approximate $38 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2016. A 10% increase or decrease in the
assumed price per gallon of fuel would have an approximate $9 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2016.  Additionally, we applied the acquisition method of accounting in connection with the Merger in December 2013 and recorded a liability for outstanding US Airways’ mileage credits at fair value,
an amount significantly in excess of incremental cost. At December 31, 2016, all the mileage credits associated with this liability have been recognized in passenger revenue. At December 31, 2015, this liability was $296 million and
was included on the consolidated balance sheet within the loyalty program liability.  We also sell
loyalty program mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners. Sales of mileage credits to non-airline business partners is
comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. We account for mileage sales under our agreements with non-airline business partners in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) – Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements.” In accordance with Topic 605, we allocate the consideration received from the sale of mileage
credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered.  In 2016, American
entered into new co-branded credit card program agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US. We identified the following revenue elements in these co-branded credit card
agreements: the transportation component; the use of the American brand including access to loyalty program member lists, advertising and other travel related benefits (collectively, the marketing component). 
The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using
historical transaction information, including information related to customer redemption patterns. The transportation component is deferred based on its relative selling price and is amortized into passenger revenue on a straight-line basis over the
period in which the mileage credits are expected to be redeemed for travel. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $2.1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, in deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits recorded within
loyalty program liability on our consolidated balance sheets.  A change to certain estimates used in the
allocation of consideration received from the sale of mileage credits could have a material impact on the liability. A 10% increase or decrease in the relative selling price of the transportation component would have an approximate $81 million
impact on the liability as of December 31, 2016.  The services under the marketing component are
provided periodically, but no less than monthly. Accordingly, the marketing component is considered earned and recognized in other revenues in the period of the mileage sale. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the marketing
component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments included in other revenues was approximately $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.  Long-lived Assets  Long-lived assets
consist of flight equipment, as well as other fixed assets and finite-lived intangible assets such as certain domestic airport slots, customer relationships, marketing agreements, 
  77



Table of Contents

tradenames and airport gate leasehold rights. In addition to the original cost, the recorded value of our fixed assets is impacted by a number of estimates made, including estimated useful lives,
salvage values and our determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. Finite-lived intangible assets are originally recorded at their acquired fair values and are subsequently amortized over their estimated useful
lives. See Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information. 
We record impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that
the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds
their estimated fair value.  If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Estimates of fair value represent management’s best estimate based on appraisals, industry trends and reference to market
rates and transactions.  The majority of American’s fleet types are depreciated over 25-30 years. It is possible that the ultimate lives of our aircraft will be significantly different than the current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact our fleet plan, including positive or
negative developments in the areas described above. For example, operating the aircraft for a longer period will result in higher maintenance, fuel and other operating costs than if we replaced the aircraft. 
Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Assets 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually on
October 1st or more frequently if events
or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We have one consolidated reporting unit.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill include certain domestic airport slots at our hubs and international slots and route authorities. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
amortized but instead are assessed for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are measured for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment. Under the qualitative approach, we analyze the following factors to
determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) an increase in fuel prices, (3) declining per mile passenger
yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened U.S. and global economy and (5) changes to the regulatory environment.  If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset value may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the asset’s fair value and the amount of the impairment. Under
the quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset using the following assumptions: (1) our projected revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) an estimated weighted average cost of capital, (3) assumed discount rates
depending on the asset, (4) a tax rate and (5) market prices for comparable assets. These assumptions are consistent with those which hypothetical market participants would use. If the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value
calculated using the quantitative approach, we will record an impairment charge for the difference in fair value and carrying value. 
  78

Based upon our annual assessment, there were no impairments of our
goodwill and indefinite-lived assets in 2016.  Pensions and Retiree Medical and Other Postretirement Benefits 
We recognize the funded status (i.e. the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit
obligations) of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
Our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities are calculated using
various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (i) discount rate; (ii) expected return on plan assets; (iii) expected health care cost trend rate and
(iv) the estimated age of pilot retirement (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December 31 were:

(1) 

 When establishing our discount rate to measure our obligations, we match high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace whose cash
flows approximate our projected benefit disbursements. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2016 would increase our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations by approximately
$1.2 billion and $44 million, respectively, and increase estimated 2017 pension expense by $4 million and decrease estimated 2017 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by $1 million.
  


(2) 

 The expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience, taking into account current
and expected market conditions and our target asset allocation of 30% U.S. stocks, 22% developed international stocks, 20% long duration corporate and U.S. government/agency bonds, 20% alternative (private) investments and 8% emerging market stocks.
The expected rate of return on plan assets component of our net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets and our target asset allocation. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis
points as of December 31, 2016 would increase estimated 2017 pension expense and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by approximately $51 million and $1 million, respectively. 
 


(3) 

 The assumed health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience, taking into account current and
expected market conditions. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 100 basis points would increase estimated 2017 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by $5 million. 
During 2016, we revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new mortality improvement scale issued by the
Society of Actuaries. This resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans of $146 million and $5 million, respectively. We also reviewed and revised
certain other economic and demographic assumptions including the pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits discount rates 
  79

and health care cost and trend rates. The net effect of changing these assumptions for the pension plans resulted in an increase of $891 million in the projected benefit obligation at
December 31, 2016. The net effect of changing these assumptions for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans resulted in a decrease of $65 million in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2016. 
See Note 9 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 7 to American’s
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding our employee benefit plans. 
Income Taxes  Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes.
 We provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some
portion, or all of our deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. We consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain
assumptions in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Many factors are considered that impact our projections of future profitability, including risks associated with remaining Merger integration activities as well as other
conditions which are beyond our control, such as the health of the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices and travel demand.  In connection with the preparation of our financial statements at the end of 2015, we determined that after considering all positive and negative evidence, including the completion of certain
critical Merger integration milestones as well as our financial performance, it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred income tax assets, which include our NOLs, would be realized. Accordingly, we reversed $3.0 billion
of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for 2015. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Revenue  In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB
and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional
ASUs to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted; however, we currently expect to adopt the new revenue standard effective January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new revenue standard either retrospectively to each
reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the new revenue standard using the
full retrospective method.  We are still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the new
revenue standard will impact our consolidated financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue standard will 
  80



Table of Contents

materially impact our liability for outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost method to account for
this portion of our loyalty program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger (see Note 1 (i) Loyalty Program to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part
II, Item 8A and Note 1 (i) Loyalty Program to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B). The new revenue standard will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of
each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty program liability is
expected to be materially greater under the relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees to
passenger revenue, which are currently included within other operating revenue.  Leases 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic
842).” ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and aligns
many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
after the date of initial application with an option to use certain practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption of the new lease standard will impact our consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are on-going and could have a material impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition
of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for as operating leases. 
See Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to American’s
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information on recent accounting pronouncements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
 The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss
arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity,
nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Therefore, actual results may differ. See Note 7 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 5 to American’s
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion regarding risk management matters.  Aircraft Fuel
 Our operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility
and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our airlines, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of fuel can have a material
effect on our costs and liquidity. Jet fuel market prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years with market spot prices ranging from a low of approximately $0.80 per gallon to a high of approximately $3.34 per gallon during the
period from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2016.  As of December 31, 2016, we did not
have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our
current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. Our 2017 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption is
approximately 4.3 billion gallons, and based on this forecast, a one cent per gallon increase in aviation fuel price would result in a $43 million increase in annual expense.  Foreign Currency  We are exposed to the
effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. Our largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar and various Latin American currencies,
primarily the Brazilian real. We do not currently have a foreign currency hedge program. A uniform 10% relative strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from 2016 levels relative to each of the currencies in which we have foreign currency
exposure would have resulted in an increase in total nonoperating expense, net of approximately $193 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and does not address any exposure to foreign currency held on our consolidated balance
sheet.  Generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by us
and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors –“We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in
the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control” for additional discussion of this and other currency risks. 
Interest  Our earnings and cash flow are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest income from short-term investments, and our interest expense from
variable-rate debt instruments. 
  82



Table of Contents
Our largest exposure with respect to variable rate debt comes from
changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). We had variable rate debt instruments representing approximately 40% of our total long-term debt at December 31, 2016 for both AAG and American. We currently do not have an interest rate
hedge program. If interest rates had increased 100 basis points in 2016, interest expense on variable-rate debt for 2016 would have increased by approximately $96 million and the fair value of fixed-rate debt would have decreased by
approximately $708 million for AAG and $668 million for American at December 31, 2016.

ITEM 8A. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
DATA OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.  Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm  The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
American Airlines Group Inc.:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Airlines Group Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity (deficit) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of American Airlines Group Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 22, 2017 expressed an unqualified
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN
AIRLINES GROUP INC.  1.  Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(a) Basis of Presentation  American Airlines Group Inc. (we, us, our and similar terms, or AAG), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company whose primary business activity is the operation of a major network air carrier,
providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo through its mainline operating subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc. (American) and its wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries, Envoy Aviation Group Inc. (Envoy), Piedmont Airlines,
Inc. (Piedmont) and PSA Airlines, Inc. (PSA) that operate under capacity purchase agreements as American Eagle. On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a Delaware corporation,
which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty program, valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
(b) Short-term Investments  Short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value. Realized gains and losses are
recorded in nonoperating expense on the consolidated statement of operations. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet. 
(c) Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments 
We have restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support workers’
compensation obligations.  (d) Aircraft Fuel, Spare Parts, and Supplies, Net 
Aircraft fuel is recorded on a first-in,
first-out basis. Spare parts and supplies are recorded at net realizable value based on average costs. These items are expensed when used. An allowance for obsolescence is established for spare parts and
supplies. 
  90

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.
  
(e) Operating Property and Equipment 
Operating property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized to residual values over the
asset’s estimated useful life or the lease term, whichever is less, using the straight-line method. Residual values for aircraft, engines, and related rotable parts are generally 5% to 10% of original cost. Costs of major improvements that
enhance the usefulness of the asset are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term, whichever is less. The estimated useful lives for the principal property and equipment classifications
are as follows:   








 Principal Property and Equipment Classification
  
Estimated Useful Life
 

 Aircraft, engines and related rotable parts
  
 
20 – 30 years
 

 Buildings and improvements
  
 
Lesser of 5 – 30 years
 

 Furniture, fixtures and other equipment
  
 
3 – 10 years
 

 Capitalized software
  
 
5 – 10 years
 
 We record impairment charges on operating property and equipment when events and
circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets and the net book
value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets
to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell.  (f)
Income Taxes  Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes. 
We provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or
all of our deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. We consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions in
evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Many factors are considered that impact our projections of future profitability, including risks associated with remaining Merger integration activities as well as other conditions which are
beyond our control, such as the health of the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices and travel demand. 
(g) Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually on October
1st or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We have one consolidated reporting unit.  Goodwill
is measured for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment and, if necessary, then comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the
carrying value, a second step is performed to 
  91

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.
  

determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. Based upon our
annual assessment, there was no goodwill impairment in 2016. The carrying value of the goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets was $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. 
(h) Other Intangibles, Net  Intangible assets consist primarily of domestic airport slots, customer relationships, marketing agreements, international slots and route authorities, airport gate leasehold rights and tradenames.
 Finite-Lived Intangible Assets 
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  The following table provides information relating to our amortizable intangible assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

 Certain domestic airport slots and airport gate leasehold rights are amortized on a
straight-line basis over 25 years. The customer relationships and marketing agreements were identified as intangible assets subject to amortization and are amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately nine years and 30 years, respectively.
Tradenames are fully amortized.  We recorded amortization expense related to these intangible assets of
$76 million, $55 million and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect to record annual amortization expense for these intangible assets as follows (in millions):

assessed for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $1.8 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets on our
consolidated balance sheets.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment by
initially performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If we believe impairment has occurred, we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of
assets to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. Based upon our annual assessment, there was no indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment in 2016.
 (i) Loyalty Program 
We currently operate the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on
American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of other program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, hotels and car rental
companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American or other participating partner airlines.  We use the incremental cost method to account for the portion of our loyalty program liability incurred when AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American, any oneworld
airline or other partner airlines. We have an obligation to provide future travel when these mileage credits are redeemed and therefore have recorded a liability for mileage credits outstanding. 
The incremental cost liability includes all mileage credits, even mileage credits for members whose account
balances have not yet reached the minimum level required to redeem an award. Mileage credits are subject to expiration. The liability for outstanding mileage credits is valued based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional
passenger. The estimated incremental cost primarily includes unit costs incurred for fuel, food and insurance as well as fees incurred when travel awards are redeemed on partner airlines. In calculating the liability, we estimate how many mileage
credits will never be redeemed for travel and exclude those mileage credits from the estimate of the liability. Estimates are also made for the number of miles that will be used per award redemption and the number of travel awards that will be
redeemed on partner airlines. These costs and estimates are based on our historical program experience as well as consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable. Changes in the liability resulting from members earning additional mileage
credits or changes in estimates are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a part of passenger revenue.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the liability for outstanding mileage credits accounted for under the incremental cost method was $669 million and $657 million, respectively, and is
included on the consolidated balance sheets within loyalty program liability.  Additionally, we applied
the acquisition method of accounting in connection with the Merger in December 2013 and recorded a liability for outstanding US Airways’ mileage credits at fair value, an amount significantly in excess of incremental cost. At December 31,
2016, all the mileage credits associated with this liability have been recognized in passenger revenue. At December 31, 2015, this liability was $296 million and was included on the consolidated balance sheet within the loyalty program
liability.  We also sell loyalty program mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners. Sales of mileage credits to non-airline business partners is comprised of two components,

transportation and marketing. We account for mileage sales under our agreements with non-airline business partners in accordance with Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) – Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements.” In accordance with Topic 605, we allocate the consideration received from
the sale of mileage credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered. 
In 2016, American entered into new co-branded credit card program
agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US. We identified the following revenue elements in these co-branded credit card agreements: the transportation component; the use of the American brand including access to
loyalty program member lists, advertising and other travel related benefits (collectively, the marketing component).  The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using historical transaction information, including information related to customer
redemption patterns. The transportation component is deferred based on its relative selling price and is amortized into passenger revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the mileage credits are expected to be redeemed for travel.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $2.1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, in deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits recorded within loyalty program liability on our consolidated balance sheets. 
The services under the marketing component are provided periodically, but no less than monthly. Accordingly, the
marketing component is considered earned and recognized in other revenues in the period of the mileage sale. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments
included in other revenues was approximately $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. 
(j) Revenue  Passenger Revenue  Passenger revenue is
recognized when transportation is provided. Ticket sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability represents tickets
sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in the air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. Our air
traffic liability was $3.9 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange
policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in passenger revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are
generally based on the analysis of our historical data. We and other airline industry participants have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and
exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included
in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed.  We have arrangements
with regional carriers to provide us with regional jet and turboprop service under the brand name “American Eagle.” The American Eagle carriers include our wholly-owned

regional carriers, Envoy, PSA and Piedmont, as well as third-party regional carriers including Republic Airline Inc. (Republic), Mesa Airlines, Inc. (Mesa), Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation
(Air Wisconsin), Compass Airlines, LLC (Compass), ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. (ExpressJet), SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest) and Trans States Airlines, Inc. (Trans States). We classify revenues generated from transportation on these carriers as
regional passenger revenues. Liabilities related to tickets sold by us for travel on these air carriers is also included in our air traffic liability and are subsequently recognized as revenue in the same manner as described above. 
Passenger Taxes and Fees  Various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are collected by us as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities. These taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.  Cargo Revenue  Cargo revenue is
recognized when we provide the transportation.  Other Revenue 
Other revenue includes revenue associated with marketing services provided to our business partners as part of our
loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. The accounting and recognition for the loyalty program marketing services are discussed in Note 1(i) above. Baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs
and inflight service revenues are recognized when we provide the service.  (k) Maintenance, Materials and Repairs
 Maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment are charged to operating
expense as incurred, except costs incurred for maintenance and repair under flight hour maintenance contract agreements, which are accrued based on contractual terms when an obligation exists. 
(l) Selling Expenses  Selling expenses include credit card fees, commissions, computerized reservations systems fees and advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $116 million,
$110 million and $92 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
(m) Share-based Compensation  We account for our share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock award at the time of grant, which is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock award. Certain
awards have performance conditions that must be achieved prior to vesting and are expensed based on the expected achievement at each reporting period. The fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) is estimated using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on the market price of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of grant. See Note 14 for further discussion of share-based compensation.

(n) Deferred Gains and Credits, Net 
Included within deferred gains and credits, net are amounts deferred and amortized into future periods associated
with the adjustment of leases to fair value in connection with the application of acquisition accounting, deferred gains on the sale-leaseback of aircraft and certain vendor incentives. We periodically receive vendor incentives in connection with
acquisition of aircraft and engines. These credits are deferred until aircraft and engines are delivered and then applied as a reduction to the cost of the related equipment.  (o) Foreign Currency Gains and Losses 
Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded as part of other nonoperating expense, net in our consolidated
statements of operations. Foreign currency gains for 2016 were $1 million. Foreign currency losses for 2015 and 2014 were $751 million and $114 million, respectively. Included in 2015 was a $592 million nonoperating special
charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela.  (p) Other Operating Expenses  Other
operating expenses includes costs associated with ground and cargo handling, crew travel, aircraft food and catering, passenger accommodation, airport security, international navigation fees and certain general and administrative expenses.
 (q) Regional Expenses 
Expenses associated with our wholly-owned regional airlines and third-party regional carriers operating under the
brand name American Eagle are classified as regional expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Regional expenses consist of the following (in millions):

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Revenue 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU
2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and

  96

International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public entities
for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted; however, we currently expect to adopt the new revenue standard effective January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. We currently expect
to adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective method.  We are still in the process of
evaluating how the adoption of the new revenue standard will impact our consolidated financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage
loyalty program members when flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost method to account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one
additional passenger (see (i) Loyalty Program above). The new revenue standard will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits
earned will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be materially greater under the relative selling
price approach than the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other
operating revenue.  Leases 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic
842).” ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and aligns
many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
after the date of initial application with an option to use certain practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption of the new lease standard will impact our consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are on-going and could have a material impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition
of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for as operating leases. 
Share-based Compensation  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting.” ASU 2016-09 simplifies the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, classification of
awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early

adoption is permitted. We early adopted this standard during the second quarter of 2016. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of $418 million of previously unrecognized
excess tax benefits in deferred tax assets and an increase to retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet as of the beginning of the current year, and the recognition of $15 million of excess tax benefits in the income tax provision for
the year ended December 31, 2016.  Fair Value Measurement 
In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement
(Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent).” ASU 2015-07 requires that investments using the practical expedient to measure
fair value at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) be excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Although the investments are not characterized within the fair value hierarchy, the amount of investments measured using the practical expedient
must still be disclosed to allow for reconciliation of the total investments in the fair value hierarchy to total investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. ASU 2015-07 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this standard retrospectively during the year ended December 31, 2016. The adoption impacted the fair value hierarchy disclosures of our benefit plan assets, see Note 9 for further
discussion.  Statement of Cash Flows 
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows
(Topic 230): Restricted Cash.” ASU 2016-18 requires that the change in total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and
restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This standard is
to be applied retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This standard is not
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  2.  Special Items, Net

obligations.  The 2015 mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of
$1.1 billion, which principally included $826 million of Merger integration expenses, $210 million of fleet restructuring expenses and a $53 million net credit consisting of mark-to-market adjustments for bankruptcy obligations.  The 2014
mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of $800 million, which primarily included $732 million of Merger integration expenses, $88 million of fleet restructuring expenses, an $81 million charge to revise prior
estimates of certain aircraft residual values and an $81 million

net charge for bankruptcy-related items principally consisting of mark-to-market adjustments for bankruptcy
obligations and professional fees. These charges were offset in part by a net $265 million gain related to the divestiture of slots.  Merger integration expenses included costs related to information technology, re-branding of aircraft, airport facilities and uniforms, alignment of labor
union contracts, professional fees, relocation, training, and severance, and in 2015 and 2014, also included share-based compensation related to awards granted in connection with the Merger that fully vested in December 2015. Fleet restructuring
expenses included the acceleration of aircraft depreciation, impairments, remaining lease payments and lease return costs for aircraft currently grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.

The 2014 regional operating special items, net consisted primarily of a $24 million charge due to a new pilot
labor contract at our Envoy regional subsidiary.   


(2) 

 The 2016 nonoperating special items totaled a net charge of $49 million, which consisted of debt issuance and extinguishment costs
associated with bond and term loan refinancings.  The 2015 nonoperating special items
totaled a net charge of $594 million, which principally included a $592 million charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in
Venezuela.  The 2014 nonoperating special items totaled a net charge of $132 million, which
principally included a $43 million charge for Venezuelan foreign currency losses and $56 million of early debt extinguishment costs primarily related to the prepayment of 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness. 
 


(3) 

 In 2015, income tax special items totaled a net credit of $3.0 billion. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements
for the fourth quarter of 2015, management determined that it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets, which include our net operating losses (NOLs), would be realized. Accordingly, we reversed $3.0 billion of
the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in our consolidated statement of operations. See Note 6 for further information.
 In 2014, income tax special items, net were $346 million. During 2014, we sold
our portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. In connection with this sale, we recorded a special non-cash tax provision of $330 million in the
second quarter of 2014 that reversed the non-cash tax provision which was recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI), a subset of stockholders’ equity, principally in 2009. This provision represents the
tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of our fuel hedging contracts. In accordance with GAAP, we retained the $330 million tax provision in OCI until the last contract was
settled or terminated.

 In March 2014, we notified the holders of the 7.25% convertible senior notes that we had elected to settle all future conversions solely in
cash instead of shares of AAG common stock in accordance with the related indenture. Thus, the diluted shares include the weighted average impact of the 7.25% convertible senior notes only for the period from January 1, 2014 to March 12,
2014. In addition, under GAAP, we must adjust the numerator for purposes of calculating diluted EPS by the change in fair value of the conversion feature from March 12, 2014 to May 15, 2014, which increased GAAP net income for purposes of
computing diluted EPS by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.  4.  Share Repurchase
Programs and Dividends  Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has approved several share repurchase
programs aggregating $9.0 billion of authority. As of December 31, 2016, there was no remaining authority to repurchase shares under our existing share repurchase programs. However, in January 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new
$2.0 billion share repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2018.  During the year
ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 119.8 million shares of AAG common stock for $4.4 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $36.86. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 85.1 million shares of
AAG common stock for $3.6 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $42.09. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we

repurchased 23.4 million shares of AAG common stock for $1.0 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $42.72. Since the inception of the share repurchase programs in July 2014,
we have repurchased 228.4 million shares of AAG common stock for $9.0 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $39.41.  Our Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends:

 As AAG’s corporate credit rating was Ba3 or higher from Moody’s and BB- or higher from
Standard and Poor’s (S&P) as of December 31, 2016, the applicable LIBOR margin is 2.50% for the 2013 Term Loan; otherwise, the LIBOR margin would be 2.75%. 
The Term Loans are repayable in annual installments in an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount, with any
unpaid balance due on the respective maturity dates. Voluntary prepayments may be made by American at any time.  The proceeds from the April 2016 Term Loan and the December 2016 Term Loan were used to repay $588 million and $970 million, respectively, in remaining principal plus accrued and unpaid
interest of the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility tranche B-2 term loan (Tranche B-2) and tranche B-1 term loan (Tranche B-1), respectively, with the remainder of the proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes.  The 2013 and 2014 Revolving Facilities provide that American may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow loans thereunder and have the ability to issue letters of credit thereunder in an
aggregate

amount outstanding at any time up to $300 million. The 2013 and 2014 Revolving Facilities are each subject to an undrawn fee of 0.75%. As of December 31, 2016, there were no borrowings
or letters of credit outstanding under the 2013 or 2014 Revolving Facilities. The April 2016 and December 2016 Credit Facilities each provide for a revolving credit facility that may be established in the future. 
Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Credit Facilities are secured by certain collateral, including
spare parts, certain slots, route authorities and airport gate leasehold rights. American has the ability to make future modifications to the collateral pledged, subject to certain restrictions. American’s obligations under the Credit
Facilities are guaranteed by AAG. American is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans as further described below in “Collateral-Related Covenants.” 
The Credit Facilities contain events of default customary for similar financings, including cross default to other
material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately. In addition, if a “change of control” occurs, American will (absent an amendment or
waiver) be required to repay at par the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities and terminate the 2013 and 2014 Revolving Facilities and any revolving credit facilities established under the April 2016 or December 2016 Credit Facilities. The
Credit Facilities also include covenants that, among other things, require AAG to maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the Credit Facilities) of not less than $2.0 billion, and limit the ability of AAG and its restricted
subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain
business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions.  (b) 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility
 On May 23, 2013, American entered into a term loan credit facility (as amended, the 2013
Citicorp Credit Facility) with Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent, and certain lenders. The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility consisted of Tranche B-1 and Tranche
B-2 that were repaid and terminated in 2016 in connection with American’s entry into the April 2016 and December 2016 Credit Facilities discussed above. 
(c) EETCs Issued in 2016  2016-1 EETCs  In January 2016, American created three pass-through trusts which issued approximately $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2016-1
Class AA, Class A and Class B EETCs (the 2016-1 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 22 aircraft owned by American (the 2016-1 EETC Aircraft). All
of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2016-1 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American. Interest and principal payments on the equipment notes are payable semi-annually in
January and July of each year, which began in July 2016. These equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2016-1 EETC Aircraft.

by American (the 2016-2 EETC Aircraft). All of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2016-2 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American.
Interest and principal payments on the equipment notes are payable semi-annually in June and December of each year, with interest payments that began in December 2016 and principal payments beginning in June 2017. These equipment notes are secured
by liens on the 2016-2 EETC Aircraft.  The details of the 2016-2 EETC equipment notes issued by American in three series are reflected in the table below as of December 31, 2016:

 2016-3 EETCs 
In October 2016, American created two pass-through trusts which issued approximately $814 million aggregate
principal amount of Series 2016-3 Class AA and Class A EETCs (the 2016-3 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 25 aircraft owned by American or originally
scheduled to be delivered to American through January 2017 (the 2016-3 EETC Aircraft). A portion of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2016-3 EETCs has been used
to acquire Series AA and A equipment notes issued by American to the pass-through trusts and the balance of such proceeds is being held in escrow for the benefit of the holders of the 2016-3 EETCs until such
time as American issues additional Series AA and A equipment notes to the pass-through trusts, which will purchase the notes with escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on our consolidated
balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depository are not American’s assets.  As of
December 31, 2016, approximately $705 million of the escrowed proceeds from the 2016-3 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American. Interest and principal payments on the
equipment notes are payable semi-annually in April and October of each year, with interest payments beginning in April 2017 and principal payments beginning in October 2017. These equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2016-3 EETC Aircraft. The remaining escrowed proceeds of $109 million will be used to purchase equipment notes as new aircraft are financed following their delivery.

 (d) Equipment Loans and Other Notes Payable Issued in 2016 
In 2016, American entered into loan agreements to borrow $1.8 billion in connection with the financing of
certain aircraft. Debt incurred under these loan agreements matures in 2021 through 2028 and bears interest at fixed and variable rates of LIBOR plus an applicable margin averaging 2.96% at December 31, 2016. 
(e) Special Facility Revenue Bonds  2016 Financing Activity  In June 2016,
the New York Transportation Development Corporation (NYTDC) issued approximately $844 million of special facility revenue refunding bonds (the 2016 JFK Bonds) on behalf of American. The net proceeds from the 2016 JFK Bonds generally were used
to provide a portion of the funds to refinance $1.0 billion of special facility revenue bonds (Prior JFK Bonds), the net proceeds of which partially financed the construction of a terminal (the Terminal) used by American at John F. Kennedy
International Airport (JFK).  American is required to pay debt service on the 2016 JFK Bonds through
payments under a loan agreement with NYTDC, and American and AAG guarantee the 2016 JFK Bonds. American’s and AAG’s obligations under these guarantees are secured by a mortgage on American’s lease of the Terminal and related property
from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  The 2016 JFK Bonds, in aggregate, were priced at
approximately 107% of par value. The gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2016 JFK Bonds were approximately $907 million. Of this amount, approximately $895 million was used to partially fund the redemption of the Prior JFK Bonds. The
2016 JFK Bonds bear interest at 5.0% per annum and are comprised of $212 million of serial bonds, portions of which mature annually from August 1, 2017 to August 1, 2021, and $632 million of term bonds, $278 million of which
matures on August 1, 2026 and $354 million of which matures on August 1, 2031. In connection with the refinancing of the Prior JFK Bonds, American recorded a special nonoperating charge of $36 million consisting of non-cash write offs of unamortized bond discounts and issuance costs as well as payments of redemption premiums and fees.

 The 5.50% senior notes and the 4.625% senior notes are senior unsecured obligations
of AAG. The 6.125% senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of AAG. The senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by American. The indentures for the senior notes contain covenants and events of default generally customary
for similar financings. In addition, if we experience specific kinds of changes of control, we must offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the
repurchase date. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the senior notes may be accelerated and become due and payable.  Guarantees  As of December 31,
2016, AAG had issued guarantees covering approximately $844 million of American’s special facility revenue bonds (and interest thereon) and $9.3 billion of American’s secured debt (and interest thereon), including the Credit
Facilities and certain EETC financings.  Collateral-Related Covenants 
Certain of our debt financing agreements contain loan to value (LTV) ratio covenants and require us to annually
appraise the related collateral. Pursuant to such agreements, if the LTV ratio exceeds a specified threshold, we are required, as applicable, to pledge additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash collateral), or pay down
such financing, in whole or in part.

 We provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, which include our
NOLs, when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of our deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. We consider all
available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Many factors are considered that impact our projections of future profitability, including risks associated with
remaining Merger integration activities as well as other conditions which are beyond our control, such as the health of the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices and travel demand. 
In connection with the preparation of our financial statements at the end of 2015, we determined that after
considering all positive and negative evidence, including the completion of certain critical Merger integration milestones as well as our financial performance, it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred income tax assets,
which include our NOLs, would be realized. Accordingly, we reversed $3.0 billion of the valuation allowance, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in the consolidated statement of
operations.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $330 million tax provision.
During 2014, we sold our portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. In connection with this sale, we recorded a special non-cash tax provision of
$330 million in the second quarter of 2014 that reversed the non-cash tax provision which was recorded in OCI, a subset of stockholders’ equity, principally in 2009. This provision represents the tax
effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of our fuel hedging contracts. In accordance with GAAP, we retained the $330 million tax provision in OCI until the last contract was
settled or terminated.  In addition to the changes in the valuation allowance from operations described
in the table above, the valuation allowance was also impacted by the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), described in Note 10. The total increase in the valuation allowance was $7 million in 2016. The
total decrease in the valuation allowance was $4.8 billion and $197 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

 At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $10.5 billion of gross NOL
Carryforwards to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in 2022 if unused. We also had approximately $3.7 billion of NOL
Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2016, which will expire in years 2017 through 2036 if unused. Our ability to deduct our NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be
substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 where an “ownership change” has occurred. Substantially all of our remaining federal NOL Carryforwards (attributable to US Airways Group) are subject
to limitation under Section 382; however, our ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. We elected to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax
purposes that permitted approximately $9.0 billion (with $8.9 billion of unlimited NOL still remaining at December 31, 2016) of our federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by
Section 382. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. Our ability to utilize any new NOL Carryforwards arising after the ownership changes is not affected by the annual limitation rules imposed by Section 382 unless
another future ownership change occurs. Under the Section 382 limitation, cumulative stock ownership changes among material stockholders exceeding 50% during a rolling three-year period can potentially limit a company’s future use of NOLs
and tax credits. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards may be limited” for unaudited additional discussion of this risk. 
At December 31, 2016, we had an AMT credit carryforward of approximately $339 million available for
federal income tax purposes, which is available for an indefinite period.

In 2016, we recorded an income tax provision with an effective
rate of approximately 38%, which was substantially non-cash as we utilized our NOLs described above. Substantially all of our income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. 
We file our tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our 2013 through
2015 tax years are still subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Various state and foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination and we are under examination, in administrative appeals, or engaged in tax litigation in
certain jurisdictions. We believe that the effect of any assessments will not be material to our consolidated financial statements.  The amount of, and changes to, our uncertain tax positions were not material in any of the years presented. We accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense
and operating expense, respectively.  7.  Risk Management 
Our economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the
price of fuel.  Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending, airline
industry revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand
for air travel and changes in booking practices, both of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our revenues. In addition, during challenging economic times, actions by our competitors to increase their
revenues can have an adverse impact on our revenues.  Our operating results are materially impacted by
changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Jet fuel market prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years and prices continue to
be highly volatile. Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of fuel can have a material effect on our operating results and liquidity. 
These additional factors could impact our results of operations, financial performance and liquidity: 
(a) Credit Risk  Most of our receivables relate to tickets sold to individual passengers through the use of major credit cards or to tickets sold by other airlines and used by passengers on American. These
receivables are short-term, mostly settled within seven days after sale. Bad debt losses, which have been minimal in the past, have been considered in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts. We do not believe we are subject to any significant
concentration of credit risk.  (b) Interest Rate Risk 
We have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our variable rate
debt obligations. Interest rates on $9.6 billion principal amount of long-term debt as of December 31, 2016 are subject to adjustment to reflect changes in floating interest rates. The weighted average effective interest rate on our
variable rate debt was 3.1% at December 31, 2016. We do not currently have an interest rate hedge program. 
  111



Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.
  
(c) Foreign Currency Risk 
We are exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign
currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. Our largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar and various Latin American currencies, primarily the Brazilian real. We do not currently have a foreign currency hedge
program. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely
affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control” for unaudited additional discussion of this risk.  8.  Fair Value Measurements  Assets Measured at
Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from
the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. an exit price) on the measurement date in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Accounting standards
include disclosure requirements around fair values used for certain financial instruments and establish a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes valuation inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair
value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of three levels:   


 
•
 
 Level 1 – Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
 


 
•
 
 Level 2 – Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
  


 
•
 
 Level 3 – Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own
assumptions.  When available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value
of our financial assets. If quoted market prices are not available, we measure fair value using valuation techniques that use, when possible, current market-based or independently-sourced market parameters, such as interest rates and currency rates.
 We utilize the market approach to measure fair value for our financial assets. The market approach uses
prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Our short-term investments classified as Level 2 primarily utilize broker quotes in a
non-active market for valuation of these securities. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. 
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions):

2012, substantially all of our defined benefit pension plans were frozen and we began providing enhanced benefits under our defined contribution pension plans for certain groups. We use a
December 31 measurement date for all of our defined benefit pension plans. We also provide certain retiree medical and other postretirement benefits, including health care and life insurance benefits, to retired employees. Effective
November 1, 2012, we modified our retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans to eliminate the company subsidy for employees who retire on or after November 1, 2012. As a result of modifications to our retiree medical and other
postretirement benefits plans in 2012, we recognized a negative plan amendment of $1.9 billion, which is included as a component of actuarial gain in OCI and will be amortized over the future service life of the active plan participants for
whom the benefit was eliminated, or approximately eight years. As of December 31, 2016, $871 million of actuarial gain remains to be amortized.  Benefit Obligations, Fair Value of Plan Assets and Funded Status  The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations, fair value of plan assets and a statement of funded

 The 2016, 2015 and 2014 prior service cost does not include amortization of $1 million, $3 million and $14 million,
respectively, related to other postretirement benefits.  The estimated amount of
unrecognized net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is $144 million. 
The estimated amount of unrecognized net gain for the retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans that
will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is $23 million.  Assumptions  The following actuarial

 The weighted average health care cost trend rate at December 31, 2016 is assumed to decline gradually to 3.77% by 2024 and remain level
thereafter.  As of December 31, 2016, our estimate of the long-term rate of
return on plan assets was 8% based on the target asset allocation. Expected returns on long duration bonds are based on yields to maturity of the bonds held at year-end. Expected returns on other assets are
based on a combination of long-term historical returns, actual returns on plan assets achieved over the last ten years, current and expected market conditions, and expected value to be generated through active management, currency overlay and
securities lending programs.  A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates
would have the following effects on our retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans (in millions):

Minimum Contributions 
We are required to make minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and various other laws for U.S. based plans as well as under funding rules specific to countries where we maintain defined benefit plans. Based on current funding assumptions, we
have minimum required contributions of $25 million for 2017. We expect to make supplemental contributions of $254 million to our U.S. based defined benefit plans in 2017. Currently, the minimum funding obligation for our U.S. based defined
benefit pension plans is subject to temporary favorable rules that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Our pension funding obligations are likely to increase materially following expiration of the temporary funding rules, when we will be
required to make contributions relating to the 2018 fiscal year. The amount of these obligations will depend on the performance of our investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities, the amount of and
timing of any supplemental contributions and our actuarial experience.  Benefit Payments

 Plan Assets 
The objectives of our investment policies are to: maintain sufficient income and liquidity to pay retirement
benefits; produce a long-term rate of return that meets or exceeds the assumed rate of return for plan assets; limit the volatility of asset performance and funded status; and diversify assets among asset classes and investment managers. 
Based on these investment objectives, a long-term strategic asset allocation has been established. This strategic
allocation seeks to balance the potential benefit of improving funded position with the potential risk that the funded position would decline. The current strategic target asset allocation is as follows:

stocks are managed using a value investment approach in order to participate in the returns generated by stocks in the long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. U.S. long duration
bonds are used to partially hedge the assets from declines in interest rates. Alternative (private) investments are used to provide expected returns in excess of the public markets over the long-term. Additionally, the pension plan’s master
trust engages currency overlay managers in an attempt to increase returns by protecting non-U.S. dollar denominated assets from a rise in the relative value of the U.S. dollar. The pension plan’s master
trust also participates in securities lending programs to generate additional income by loaning plan assets to borrowers on a fully collateralized basis. These programs are subject to market risk. 
Investments in securities traded on recognized securities exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price on
the last business day of the year. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at the last bid price. The money market fund is valued at fair value which
represents the net asset value of the shares of such fund as of the close of business at the end of the period. Investments in limited partnerships are carried at estimated net asset value as determined by and reported by the general partners of the
partnerships and represent the proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the limited partnerships. Common/collective trusts are valued at net asset value based on the fair values of the underlying investments of the
trusts as determined by the sponsor of the trusts. The pension plan’s master trust also invests in a 103-12 investment entity (the 103-12 Investment Trust) which is
designed to invest plan assets of more than one unrelated employer. The 103-12 Investment Trust is valued at net asset value which is determined by the issuer at the end of each month and is based on the
aggregate fair value of trust assets less liabilities, divided by the number of units outstanding. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the year.

 Investments in the retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans’
mutual funds are valued by quoted prices on the active market, which is fair value and represents the net asset value of the shares of such funds as of the close of business at the end of the period. AMR Class shares are offered without a sales
charge to participants. Purchases are restricted to certain retirement benefit plans, including our retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans, resulting in a fair value classification of Level 2. Investments include approximately
27% of investments in non-U.S. common stocks in each of 2016 and 2015. Net asset value is based on the fair market value of the funds’ underlying assets and liabilities at the date of determination.
 Profit Sharing Program 
We instituted an employee profit sharing program effective on January 1, 2016 and accrue 5% of our pre-tax income excluding special items to distribute to employees in early 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we accrued $314 million for this program.

 (c) Capacity Purchase Agreements with Third-Party Regional Carriers 
American has capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. The capacity purchase agreements
provide that all revenues, including passenger, in-flight, ancillary, mail and freight revenues, go to American. In return, American agrees to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an
agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board. In addition, these agreements provide that American reimburses 100% of certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees and passenger liability insurance.
American controls marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories.  As of
December 31, 2016, American’s capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers had expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2027, with rights of American to extend the respective terms of certain agreements. See Part I,
Item 2. Properties for unaudited information on the aircraft operated by third-party regional carriers under such capacity purchase agreements.  As of December 31, 2016, American’s minimum fixed obligations under its capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers are as follows (approximately, in millions):

 Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs
based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and American’s actual payments could differ materially. These obligations also include the portion of American’s future obligations related to aircraft deemed
to be leased in the amount of approximately $434 million in 2017, $370 million in 2018, $349 million in 2019, $317 million in 2020, $280 million in 2021 and $927 million in 2022 and thereafter.
 (d) Operating Leases 
We lease certain aircraft, engines and ground equipment, in addition to the majority of our ground facilities and
terminal space. As of December 31, 2016, we had 419 aircraft under operating leases, with remaining terms ranging from three months to approximately 11 years. Airports are utilized for flight operations under lease arrangements with the
municipalities or agencies owning or controlling such airports. Substantially all leases provide that the lessee must pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other operating expenses applicable to the leased property. Some leases also include
renewal and purchase options.  As of December 31, 2016, obligations under noncancellable operating
leases for future minimum lease payments are as follows (approximately, in millions):

 Mainline and regional rent expense, excluding landing fees, was $2.8 billion
in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014.  (e) Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 Aircraft  American currently operates 346 owned aircraft and 138 leased aircraft which were financed with EETCs issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are
off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance the acquisition of flight equipment. Rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or
refinanced, these trusts allow American to raise the financing for a number of aircraft at one time and, if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. The trusts were also
structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to
American.  Each trust covers a set number of aircraft scheduled to be delivered or refinanced upon the
issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or
held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft. The equipment notes are issued, at American’s election, in connection with a mortgage financing of
the aircraft or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the 
  125



Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.
  

case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leases the aircraft to American. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft. The pass-through
trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have
been guaranteed by AAG. As of December 31, 2016, $10.9 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
With respect to leveraged leases, American evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest
entity. American concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities. American generally is not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the
lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates American to absorb decreases in value or entitles American to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. American does not
provide residual value guarantees to the bondholders or equity participants in the trusts. Some leases have a fair market value or a fixed price purchase option that allows American to purchase the aircraft at or near the end of the lease term.
However, the option price approximates an estimate of the aircraft’s fair value at the option date. Under this feature, American does not participate in any increases in the value of the aircraft. American concluded it is not the primary
beneficiary under these arrangements. Therefore, American accounts for its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American’s total future obligations under these leveraged lease financings are $1.5 billion as of
December 31, 2016, which are included in the future minimum lease payments table above.  Special Facility
Revenue Bonds  AAG guarantees the payment of principal and interest of certain special facility
revenue bonds issued by municipalities primarily to build or improve airport facilities and purchase equipment which is leased to American. Under such leases, American is required to make rental payments through 2035, sufficient to pay maturing
principal and interest payments on the related bonds. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining lease payments guaranteeing the principal and interest on these bonds are $605 million, which are accounted for as operating leases. 
(f) Legal Proceedings  Chapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011, AMR, American, and certain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the
Debtors’ fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the Merger. 
Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG
common stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 25.2 million shares of AAG common stock remaining in the
Disputed Claims Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the Effective Date. However, we are
not required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed 
  126

unsecured claims. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to us but rather will be
distributed to former AMR stockholders.  There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary
proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated without liability
to American. On April 18, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court granted American’s motion for summary judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that their benefits were not vested and
could be terminated. The summary judgment motion was denied with respect to all other retirees. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits concerning whether those retirees’ benefits are vested, and American cannot predict
whether it will receive relief from obligations to provide benefits to any of those retirees. Our financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or termination of benefits that may
ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome of this proceeding.  DOJ Antitrust Civil
Investigative Demand. In June 2015, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air passenger
capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information from us, and other airlines have announced that they have received similar requests. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the delivery
of CIDs by the DOJ, we, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits
alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On October 28, 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants
to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ investigation and these lawsuits are in their relatively early stages and we intend to defend these matters vigorously. 
Private Party Antitrust Action. On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US
Airways Group, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group and US Airways, Inc., alleged that the effect of the Merger may be to create a
monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the Bankruptcy Court,
adding AMR and American as defendants. On November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On August 19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful attempts to amend their
complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding air
passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was denied on October 15, 2015. A jointly proposed
schedule for the remainder of the case was submitted on September 7, 2016, which has not yet been accepted by the Bankruptcy Court. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations. 
DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal Service. In April 2015, the DOJ informed us of an
inquiry regarding American’s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air. In October 2015, we received a CID from the DOJ seeking certain information relating to these
contracts and the DOJ has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is

investigating potential violations of the False Claims Act or other statutes. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its investigation. 
General. In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, we and our subsidiaries are also
engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control.
Therefore, although we will vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain but could be material. See Part
I, Item 1A. Risk Factors –“We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity” for unaudited additional discussion. 
(g) Guarantees and Indemnifications 
We are party to many routine contracts in which we provide general indemnities in the normal course of business to
third parties for various risks. We are not able to estimate the potential amount of any liability resulting from the indemnities. These indemnities are discussed in the following paragraphs. 
In our aircraft financing agreements, we generally indemnify the financing parties, trustees acting on their behalf
and other relevant parties against liabilities (including certain taxes) resulting from the financing, manufacture, design, ownership, operation and maintenance of the aircraft regardless of whether these liabilities (or taxes) relate to the
negligence of the indemnified parties.  Our loan agreements and other LIBOR-based financing transactions
(including certain leveraged aircraft leases) generally obligate us to reimburse the applicable lender for incremental costs due to a change in law that imposes (i) any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with or
credit extended by such lender related to the loan, (ii) any tax, duty or other charge with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (iii) capital adequacy requirements. In addition, our loan agreements and other financing
arrangements typically contain a withholding tax provision that requires us to pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other financing party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result
of a change in the applicable tax law.  These increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for
the entire term of the applicable transaction, and there is no limitation on the maximum additional amounts we could be obligated to pay under such provisions. Any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions generally would trigger an event of
default and, in a secured financing transaction, would entitle the lender to foreclose on the collateral to realize the amount due.  In certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing leases and loans, the lessors, lenders and/or other parties have rights to terminate the transaction based on changes in foreign tax
law, illegality or certain other events or circumstances. In such a case, we may be required to make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant transaction.  We have general indemnity clauses in many of our airport and other real estate leases where we as lessee indemnify the lessor (and related parties) against liabilities related to our use of the
leased property. Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities resulting from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but not liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified parties. In addition, we
provide environmental indemnities in many of these leases for contamination related to our use of the leased property. 
  128



Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.
  
Under certain contracts with third parties, we indemnify the
third-party against legal liability arising out of an action by the third-party, or certain other parties. The terms of these contracts vary and the potential exposure under these indemnities cannot be determined. We have liability insurance
protecting us for some of the obligations we have undertaken under these indemnities.  We are involved
in certain claims and litigation related to our operations. We are also subject to regulatory assessments in the ordinary course of business. We establish reserves for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies
that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, liabilities, if any, arising from these regulatory matters, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows, after consideration of available insurance.  As of
December 31, 2016, AAG had issued guarantees covering approximately $844 million of American’s special facility revenue bonds (and interest thereon) and $9.3 billion of American’s secured debt (and interest thereon),
including the Credit Facilities and certain EETC financings.  (h) Credit Card Processing Agreements
 We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of
air travel and other services. Our agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a holdback) equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that company,
but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. Additional holdback requirements in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition will reduce our liquidity in the form of unrestricted cash by the amount of the
holdbacks. We are not currently required to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements.  (i) Labor
Negotiations  As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 122,300 active full-time
equivalent employees, of which 20,800 were employed by our regional operations. Approximately 85% of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. Negotiations for joint collective bargaining agreements
covering our mainline maintenance, fleet service, stores and planner employees as well as for certain employee groups at our wholly-owned regional subsidiaries are continuing. There is no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of these
labor negotiations will be achieved.  (j) Other 
As a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent liability protections provided
for by the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Stabilization Act), we recorded a liability for these terrorist attacks claims equal to the related insurance receivable due to us. The Stabilization Act provides that,
notwithstanding any other provision of law, liability for all claims, whether compensatory or punitive, arising from these terrorist attacks, against any air carrier shall not exceed the liability coverage maintained by the air carrier. As of
December 31, 2016, the remaining liability and the amount of the offsetting receivable were each $974 million.

 13.  Operating Segments and Related Disclosures 
We are managed as a single business unit that provides air transportation for passengers and cargo. This allows us
to benefit from an integrated revenue pricing and route network that includes American and our wholly-owned and third-party regional carriers that fly under capacity purchase agreements operating as American Eagle. The flight equipment of all these
carriers is combined to form one fleet that is deployed through a single route scheduling system. When making resource allocation decisions, the chief operating decision maker evaluates flight profitability data, which considers aircraft type and
route economics, but gives no weight to the financial impact of the resource allocation decision on an individual carrier basis. The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximize consolidated financial results, not the individual
results of American or American Eagle.  Our operating revenues by geographic region as defined by the
United States Department of Transportation (DOT) are summarized below (in millions):

 We attribute operating revenues by geographic region based upon the origin and
destination of each flight segment. Our tangible assets consist primarily of flight equipment, which are mobile across geographic markets and, therefore, have not been allocated.  14.  Share-based Compensation  The
2013 AAG Incentive Award Plan (the 2013 Plan) provides that awards may be in the form of an option, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit award, performance award, dividend equivalent award, deferred stock award, deferred stock unit award,
stock payment award or stock appreciation right. The 2013 Plan authorizes the grant of awards for the issuance of 40 million shares. Any shares underlying awards granted under the 2013 Plan, or any
pre-existing US Airways Group plan, that are forfeited, terminate or are settled in cash (in whole or in part) without the delivery of shares will again be available for grant.

Our net income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014 included $102 million, $274 million and $381 million, respectively, of share-based compensation costs. Of the 2015 and 2014 amounts, $198 million and $224 million, respectively, were related to awards granted to
certain employees in connection with the Merger and recorded in special items, net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we withheld approximately 1.4 million, 7.0 million and 1.7 million shares of AAG common stock, respectively, and paid approximately $56 million,
$306 million and $62 million, respectively, in satisfaction of certain tax withholding obligations associated with employee equity awards.  (a) Restricted Stock Unit Awards (RSUs) 
We have granted RSUs with service conditions (time vested primarily over three years) and performance conditions.
The grant-date fair value of RSUs is equal to the market price of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of grant. For time vested awards, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award.
For awards with performance conditions, the expense is recognized based on the expected achievement at each reporting period. Stock-settled RSUs are classified as equity awards as the vesting results in the issuance of shares of AAG common stock.
Cash-settled restricted stock unit awards (CRSUs) are classified as liability awards as the vesting results in payment of cash.  Stock-settled RSU award activity for all plans for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (shares in thousands):

 As of December 31, 2016, there was $116 million of unrecognized
compensation cost related to stock-settled RSUs. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of one year. The total fair value of stock-settled RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was
$107 million, $750 million and $154 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2016, we had a nominal amount of CRSUs
outstanding. The total cash paid for CRSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was less than $1 million, $10 million and $12 million, respectively. 
(b) Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights 
We assumed US Airways Group’s outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights in connection with the
Merger using an exchange ratio of one to one. These stock options and stock appreciation rights were granted with an exercise price equal to the underlying common stock’s fair value at the date of each grant, have service conditions, become
exercisable over a three-year vesting period and expire if unexercised at the end of their term, which ranges from seven to ten years. Stock options and stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) are classified as equity awards as the exercise
results in the issuance of shares of AAG common stock. Cash-settled stock appreciation rights (CSARs) are classified as liability awards as the exercise results in payment of cash. Compensation costs were expensed on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period for the entire award. There are no unrecognized compensation costs as all awards outstanding are vested.

 Our fourth quarter 2016 results include $273 million of total net special
charges consisting principally of $121 million of Merger integration expenses, $104 million of fleet restructuring expenses and a $47 million net charge consisting of
mark-to-market adjustments for bankruptcy obligations.  Our fourth quarter 2015 results include $2.0 billion of total net special credits consisting principally of a $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit
recorded in connection with the reversal of our tax valuation allowance, offset in part by a nonoperating net special charge of $592 million to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us due to continued lack of repatriations
and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela and $450 million in total operating special charges primarily consisting of Merger integration expenses and fleet restructuring expenses. 
17.  Subsequent Events  2017-1 EETCs  In January 2017, American created three pass-through trusts which issued approximately $983 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2017-1
Class AA, Class A and Class B EETCs (the 2017-1 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 24 aircraft scheduled to be delivered to American between January 2017 and May 2017 (the 2017-1 Aircraft). A portion of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2017-1 EETCs has been used to acquire Series AA, A and B equipment notes issued by American to the
pass-through trusts and the balance of such proceeds is being held in escrow for 
  134



Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.
  

the benefit of the holders of the 2017-1 EETCs until such time as American issues additional Series AA, A and B equipment notes to the pass-through trusts,
which will purchase the equipment notes with escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on our consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depository are not American’s
assets.  Series AA equipment notes bear interest at 3.65% per annum, Series A equipment notes bear
interest at 4.00% per annum and Series B equipment notes bear interest at 4.95% per annum. Interest and principal payments on the equipment notes will be payable semi-annually in February and August of each year, with interest payments beginning in
August 2017 and principal payments beginning in February 2018. The final payments on the Series AA and Series A equipment notes are due in February 2029 and the final payment on the Series B equipment notes is due in February 2025. The equipment
notes are secured by liens on the 2017-1 Aircraft.  Share Repurchase
Program and Dividend Declaration  In January 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors had
authorized a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2018. Share repurchases under our share repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately
negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Our share
repurchase programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion.  Also in January 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a $0.10 per share dividend for stockholders of record on February 13, 2017, and payable on February 27, 2017.
Any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and
payment of dividends may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

ITEM 8B. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
DATA OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm  The Board of Directors and Stockholder 
American Airlines, Inc.:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Airlines, Inc. and subsidiaries (American) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholder’s equity (deficit) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of American’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American Airlines, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), American’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 22, 2017 expressed an unqualified
opinion on the effectiveness of American’s internal control over financial reporting.  /s/ KPMG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN
AIRLINES, INC.  1.  Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(a) Basis of Presentation  American Airlines, Inc. (American) is a Delaware corporation whose primary business activity is the operation of a major network air carrier. American is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American
Airlines Group Inc. (AAG), which owns all of American’s outstanding common stock, par value $1.00 per share. On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a Delaware corporation,
which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. On December 30, 2015, in order to
simplify AAG’s internal corporate structure, US Airways, Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group, merged with and into American, with American as the surviving corporation. 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty program, valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
(b) Short-term Investments  Short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value. Realized gains and losses are
recorded in nonoperating expense on the consolidated statement of operations. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet. 
(c) Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments 
American has restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support
workers’ compensation obligations.  (d) Aircraft Fuel, Spare Parts, and Supplies, Net 
Aircraft fuel is recorded on a first-in,
first-out basis. Spare parts and supplies are recorded at net realizable value based on average costs. These items are expensed when used. An allowance for obsolescence is established for spare parts and
supplies.

(e) Operating Property and Equipment 
Operating property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized to residual values over the
asset’s estimated useful life or the lease term, whichever is less, using the straight-line method. Residual values for aircraft, engines, and related rotable parts are generally 5% to 10% of original cost. Costs of major improvements that
enhance the usefulness of the asset are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term, whichever is less. The estimated useful lives for the principal property and equipment classifications
are as follows:

 American records impairment charges on operating property and equipment when events
and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets and the net book
value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets
to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell.  (f)
Income Taxes  Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes. 
American provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some
portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. American considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes
certain assumptions in evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax assets. Many factors are considered that impact American’s projections of future profitability, including risks associated with remaining Merger integration activities as
well as other conditions which are beyond American’s control, such as the health of the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices and travel demand.  (g) Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually on October
1st or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. American has one consolidated reporting unit. 
Goodwill is measured for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment and, if necessary, then
comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to

  143

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.
  

determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. Based upon
American’s annual assessment, there was no goodwill impairment in 2016. The carrying value of the goodwill on American’s consolidated balance sheets was $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. 
(h) Other Intangibles, Net  Intangible assets consist primarily of domestic airport slots, customer relationships, marketing agreements, international slots and route authorities, airport gate leasehold rights and tradenames.
 Finite-Lived Intangible Assets 
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  The following table provides information relating to American’s amortizable intangible assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

 Certain domestic airport slots and airport gate leasehold rights are amortized on a
straight-line basis over 25 years. The customer relationships and marketing agreements were identified as intangible assets subject to amortization and are amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately nine years and 30 years, respectively.
Tradenames are fully amortized.  American recorded amortization expense related to these intangible
assets of $76 million, $55 million and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. American expects to record annual amortization expense for these intangible assets as follows (in millions):

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
Indefinite-lived intangible assets include certain domestic airport slots at American’s
hubs and international slots and route authorities. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are assessed for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. As of December 31,
2016 and 2015, American had $1.8 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets on its consolidated balance sheets.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether American believes it is more likely than not that an asset has
been impaired. If American believes impairment has occurred, American then evaluates for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of assets to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is
less than its carrying value. Based upon American’s annual assessment, there was no indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment in 2016.  (i) Loyalty Program  American currently
operates the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of other program participants, such as the Citi and
Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American or other participating partner airlines. 
American uses the incremental cost method to account for the portion of its loyalty program liability incurred when
AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines. American has an obligation to provide future travel when these mileage credits are redeemed and therefore have recorded a liability
for mileage credits outstanding.  The incremental cost liability includes all mileage credits, even
mileage credits for members whose account balances have not yet reached the minimum level required to redeem an award. Mileage credits are subject to expiration. The liability for outstanding mileage credits is valued based on the estimated
incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. The estimated incremental cost primarily includes unit costs incurred for fuel, food and insurance as well as fees incurred when travel awards are redeemed on partner airlines. In calculating
the liability, American estimates how many mileage credits will never be redeemed for travel and excludes those mileage credits from the estimate of the liability. Estimates are also made for the number of miles that will be used per award
redemption and the number of travel awards that will be redeemed on partner airlines. These costs and estimates are based on American’s historical program experience as well as consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable. Changes in
the liability resulting from members earning additional mileage credits or changes in estimates are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a part of passenger revenue. 
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the liability for outstanding mileage credits accounted for under the
incremental cost method was $669 million and $657 million, respectively, and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within loyalty program liability. 
Additionally, American applied the acquisition method of accounting in connection with AAG’s Merger in
December 2013 and recorded a liability for outstanding US Airways’ mileage credits at fair value, an amount significantly in excess of incremental cost. At December 31, 2016, all the mileage credits associated with this liability have been
recognized in passenger revenue. At December 31, 2015, this liability was $296 million and was included on the consolidated balance sheet within the loyalty program liability. 
  145

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.
  
American also sells loyalty program mileage credits to
participating airline partners and non-airline business partners. Sales of mileage credits to non-airline business partners is comprised of two components,
transportation and marketing. American accounts for mileage sales under its agreements with non-airline business partners in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
No. 2009-13, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) — Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements.” In accordance with Topic 605, American allocates the consideration received from the
sale of mileage credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered.  In
2016, American entered into new co-branded credit card program agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US. American identified the following revenue elements in these
co-branded credit card agreements: the transportation component; the use of the American brand including access to loyalty program member lists, advertising and other travel related benefits (collectively, the
marketing component).  The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future
travel awards and is determined using historical transaction information, including information related to customer redemption patterns. The transportation component is deferred based on its relative selling price and is amortized into passenger
revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the mileage credits are expected to be redeemed for travel. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, American had $2.1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, in deferred revenue from
the sale of mileage credits recorded within loyalty program liability on its consolidated balance sheets. 
The services under the marketing component are provided periodically, but no less than monthly. Accordingly, the
marketing component is considered earned and recognized in other revenues in the period of the mileage sale. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments
included in other revenues was approximately $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. 
(j) Revenue  Passenger Revenue  Passenger revenue is
recognized when transportation is provided. Ticket sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability represents tickets
sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in the air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity.
American’s air traffic liability was $3.9 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange
policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in passenger revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are
generally based on the analysis of American’s historical data. American and other airline industry participants have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future
refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of American’s estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic
liability are included in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed.

American has arrangements with regional carriers to provide it
with regional jet and turboprop service under the brand name “American Eagle.” The American Eagle carriers include AAG’s wholly-owned regional carriers, Envoy, PSA and Piedmont, as well as third-party regional carriers including
Republic Airline Inc. (Republic), Mesa Airlines, Inc. (Mesa), Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation (Air Wisconsin), Compass Airlines, LLC (Compass), ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. (ExpressJet), SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest) and Trans States Airlines,
Inc. (Trans States). American classifies revenues generated from transportation on these carriers as regional passenger revenues. Liabilities related to tickets sold by American for travel on these air carriers are also included in American’s
air traffic liability and are subsequently recognized as revenue in the same manner as described above.  Passenger
Taxes and Fees  Various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are
collected by American as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities. These taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate
taxing authority.  Cargo Revenue 
Cargo revenue is recognized when American provides the transportation. 
Other Revenue  Other revenue includes revenue associated with marketing services provided to American’s business partners as part of its loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and
inflight services. The accounting and recognition for the loyalty program marketing services are discussed in Note 1(i) above. Baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight service revenues are recognized when American provides the
service.  (k) Maintenance, Materials and Repairs 
Maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred,
except costs incurred for maintenance and repair under flight hour maintenance contract agreements, which are accrued based on contractual terms when an obligation exists.  (l) Selling Expenses  Selling expenses
include credit card fees, commissions, computerized reservations systems fees and advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $116 million, $110 million and $92 million for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  (m) Share-based Compensation 
American accounts for its share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock award at the time of
grant, which is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock award. Certain awards have performance conditions that must be achieved prior to vesting and are expensed based on the expected achievement at each reporting period. The fair
value of stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on the market price of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of
grant. See Note 12 for further discussion of share-based compensation.

(n) Deferred Gains and Credits, Net 
Included within deferred gains and credits, net are amounts deferred and amortized into future periods associated
with the adjustment of leases to fair value in connection with the application of acquisition accounting, deferred gains on the sale-leaseback of aircraft and certain vendor incentives. American periodically receives vendor incentives in connection
with acquisition of aircraft and engines. These credits are deferred until aircraft and engines are delivered and then applied as a reduction to the cost of the related equipment. 
(o) Foreign Currency Gains and Losses 
Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded as part of other nonoperating expense, net in American’s
consolidated statements of operations. Foreign currency gains for 2016 were $1 million. Foreign currency losses for 2015 and 2014 were $751 million and $114 million, respectively. Included in 2015 was a $592 million nonoperating
special charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by American due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. 
(p) Other Operating Expenses  Other operating expenses includes costs associated with ground and cargo handling, crew travel, aircraft food and catering, passenger accommodation, airport security, international navigation fees
and certain general and administrative expenses.  (q) Regional Expenses 
Expenses associated with American’s third-party regional carriers operating under the brand name American Eagle

(r) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
Revenue  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is
effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted; however, American currently expects to adopt the new revenue standard effective January 1, 2018.
Entities have the choice to apply the new revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not adjusting
comparative information. American currently expects to adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective method.  American is still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the new revenue standard will impact its consolidated financial statements. American currently expects that the new revenue
standard will materially impact its liability for outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when flying on American. American currently uses the incremental cost method to account for this portion of its loyalty
program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger (see (i) Loyalty Program above). The new revenue standard will require American to change its policy and apply a
relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The carrying value of the earned mileage
credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be materially greater under the relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue standard will also
require American to reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other operating revenue.  Leases  In February 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to adopt the new lease
standard using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing after the date of initial application with an option to use certain practical expedients. American is currently evaluating how the adoption of the new lease
standard will impact its consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are on-going and could have a material impact on American’s implementation. Currently, American expects that the adoption of the
new lease standard will have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities principally for
certain leases currently accounted for as operating leases.  Share-based Compensation 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
“Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” ASU 2016-09 simplifies the

  149

accounting for share-based payment award transactions including the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. American early adopted this standard during the second quarter of 2016. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of $418 million of previously unrecognized excess tax benefits in
deferred tax assets and an increase to retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet as of the beginning of the current year, and the recognition of $15 million of excess tax benefits in the income tax provision for the year ended
December 31, 2016.  Fair Value Measurement 
In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement
(Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent).” ASU 2015-07 requires that investments using the practical expedient to measure
fair value at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) be excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Although the investments are not characterized within the fair value hierarchy, the amount of investments measured using the practical expedient
must still be disclosed to allow for reconciliation of the total investments in the fair value hierarchy to total investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. ASU 2015-07 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. American adopted this standard retrospectively during the year ended December 31, 2016. The adoption impacted the fair value hierarchy disclosures of American’s benefit plan assets, see
Note 7 for further discussion.  Statement of Cash Flows 
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows
(Topic 230): Restricted Cash.” ASU 2016-18 requires that the change in total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and
restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This standard is
to be applied retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This standard is not
expected to have a material impact on American’s consolidated financial statements.  2.  Special Items, Net

The 2014 mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of
$783 million, which primarily included $732 million of Merger integration expenses, $88 million of fleet restructuring expenses, an $81 million charge to revise prior estimates of certain aircraft residual values and a
$60 million net charge for bankruptcy-related items principally consisting of mark-to-market adjustments for bankruptcy obligations and professional fees. These
charges were offset in part by a net $265 million gain related to the divestiture of slots.  Merger
integration expenses included costs related to information technology, re-branding of aircraft, airport facilities and uniforms, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, relocation, training, and
severance, and in 2015 and 2014, also included share-based compensation related to awards granted in connection with the Merger that fully vested in December 2015. Fleet restructuring expenses included the acceleration of aircraft depreciation,
impairments, remaining lease payments and lease return costs for aircraft currently grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.  The following additional amounts are also included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in millions):

 The 2016 nonoperating special items totaled a net charge of $49 million, which consisted of debt issuance and extinguishment costs
associated with bond and term loan refinancings.  The 2015 nonoperating special items
totaled a net charge of $616 million, which principally included a $592 million charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by American due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in
Venezuela.  The 2014 nonoperating special items totaled a net charge of $128 million, which
principally included a $43 million charge for Venezuelan foreign currency losses and $56 million of early debt extinguishment costs primarily related to the prepayment of 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness. 
 


(3) 

 In 2015, income tax special items totaled a net credit of $3.5 billion. In connection with the preparation of American’s financial
statements for the fourth quarter of 2015, management determined that it was more likely than not that substantially all of its deferred tax assets, which include its net operating losses (NOLs), would be realized. Accordingly, American reversed
$3.5 billion of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. See Note 4 for further
information.  In 2014, income tax special items, net were $344 million. During
2014, American sold its portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. In connection with this sale, American recorded a special non-cash tax provision of
$328 million in the second quarter of 2014 that reversed the non-cash tax provision which was recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI), a subset of stockholder’s equity, principally in 2009. This
provision represents the tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of American’s fuel hedging contracts. In accordance with GAAP, American retained the $328 million tax
provision in OCI until the last contract was settled or terminated.

 As AAG’s corporate credit rating was Ba3 or higher from Moody’s and BB- or higher from
Standard and Poor’s (S&P) as of December 31, 2016, the applicable LIBOR margin is 2.50% for the 2013 Term Loan; otherwise, the LIBOR margin would be 2.75%. 
The Term Loans are repayable in annual installments in an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount, with any
unpaid balance due on the respective maturity dates. Voluntary prepayments may be made by American at any time.  The proceeds from the April 2016 Term Loan and the December 2016 Term Loan were used to repay $588 million and $970 million, respectively, in remaining principal plus accrued and unpaid
interest of the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility tranche B-2 term loan (Tranche B-2) and tranche B-1 term loan (Tranche B-1), respectively, with the remainder of the proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes.  The 2013 and 2014 Revolving Facilities provide that American may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow loans thereunder and have the ability to issue letters of credit thereunder in an
aggregate

amount outstanding at any time up to $300 million. The 2013 and 2014 Revolving Facilities are each subject to an undrawn fee of 0.75%. As of December 31, 2016, there were no borrowings
or letters of credit outstanding under the 2013 or 2014 Revolving Facilities. The April 2016 and December 2016 Credit Facilities each provide for a revolving credit facility that may be established in the future. 
Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Credit Facilities are secured by certain collateral, including
spare parts, certain slots, route authorities and airport gate leasehold rights. American has the ability to make future modifications to the collateral pledged, subject to certain restrictions. American’s obligations under the Credit
Facilities are guaranteed by AAG. American is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans as further described below in “Collateral-Related Covenants.” 
The Credit Facilities contain events of default customary for similar financings, including cross default to other
material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately. In addition, if a “change of control” occurs, American will (absent an amendment or
waiver) be required to repay at par the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities and terminate the 2013 and 2014 Revolving Facilities and any revolving credit facilities established under the April 2016 or December 2016 Credit Facilities. The
Credit Facilities also include covenants that, among other things, require AAG to maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the Credit Facilities) of not less than $2.0 billion, and limit the ability of AAG and its restricted
subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain
business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions.  (b) 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility
 On May 23, 2013, American entered into a term loan credit facility (as amended, the 2013
Citicorp Credit Facility) with Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent, and certain lenders. The 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility consisted of Tranche B-1 and Tranche
B-2 that were repaid and terminated in 2016 in connection with American’s entry into the April 2016 and December 2016 Credit Facilities discussed above. 
(c) EETCs Issued in 2016  2016-1 EETCs  In January 2016, American created three pass-through trusts which issued approximately $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2016-1
Class AA, Class A and Class B EETCs (the 2016-1 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 22 aircraft owned by American (the 2016-1 EETC Aircraft). All
of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2016-1 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American. Interest and principal payments on the equipment notes are payable semi-annually in
January and July of each year, which began in July 2016. These equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2016-1 EETC Aircraft.

In May and July 2016, American created three pass-through trusts which issued approximately $1.1 billion
aggregate principal amount of Series 2016-2 Class AA, Class A and Class B EETCs (the 2016-2 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 22 aircraft owned
by American (the 2016-2 EETC Aircraft). All of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2016-2 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American.
Interest and principal payments on the equipment notes are payable semi-annually in June and December of each year, with interest payments that began in December 2016 and principal payments beginning in June 2017. These equipment notes are secured
by liens on the 2016-2 EETC Aircraft.  The details of the 2016-2 EETC equipment notes issued by American in three series are reflected in the table below as of December 31, 2016:

 2016-3 EETCs 
In October 2016, American created two pass-through trusts which issued approximately $814 million aggregate
principal amount of Series 2016-3 Class AA and Class A EETCs (the 2016-3 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 25 aircraft owned by American or originally
scheduled to be delivered to American through January 2017 (the 2016-3 EETC Aircraft). A portion of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2016-3 EETCs has been used
to acquire Series AA and A equipment notes issued by American to the pass-through trusts and the balance of such proceeds is being held in escrow for the benefit of the holders of the 2016-3 EETCs until such
time as American issues additional Series AA and A equipment notes to the pass-through trusts, which will purchase the notes with escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on its consolidated
balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depository are not American’s assets.  As of
December 31, 2016, approximately $705 million of the escrowed proceeds from the 2016-3 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American. Interest and principal payments on the
equipment notes are payable semi-annually in April and October of each year, with interest payments beginning in April 2017 and principal payments beginning in October 2017. These equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2016-3 EETC Aircraft. The remaining escrowed proceeds of $109 million will be used to purchase equipment notes as new aircraft are financed following their delivery.

 (d) Equipment Loans and Other Notes Payable Issued in 2016 
In 2016, American entered into loan agreements to borrow $1.8 billion in connection with the financing of
certain aircraft. Debt incurred under these loan agreements matures in 2021 through 2028 and bears interest at fixed and variable rates of LIBOR plus an applicable margin averaging 2.96% at December 31, 2016. 
(e) Special Facility Revenue Bonds  2016 Financing Activity  In June 2016,
the New York Transportation Development Corporation (NYTDC) issued approximately $844 million of special facility revenue refunding bonds (the 2016 JFK Bonds) on behalf of American. The net proceeds from the 2016 JFK Bonds generally were used
to provide a portion of the funds to refinance $1.0 billion of special facility revenue bonds (Prior JFK Bonds), the net proceeds of which partially financed the construction of a terminal (the Terminal) used by American at John F. Kennedy
International Airport (JFK).  American is required to pay debt service on the 2016 JFK Bonds through
payments under a loan agreement with NYTDC, and American and AAG guarantee the 2016 JFK Bonds. American’s and AAG’s obligations under these guarantees are secured by a mortgage on American’s lease of the Terminal and related property
from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  The 2016 JFK Bonds, in aggregate, were priced at
approximately 107% of par value. The gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2016 JFK Bonds were approximately $907 million. Of this amount, approximately $895 million was used to partially fund the redemption of the Prior JFK Bonds. The
2016 JFK Bonds bear interest at 5.0% per annum and are comprised of $212 million of serial bonds, portions of which mature annually from August 1, 2017 to August 1, 2021, and $632 million of term bonds, $278 million of which
matures on August 1, 2026 and $354 million of which matures on August 1, 2031. In connection with the refinancing of the Prior JFK Bonds, American recorded a special nonoperating charge of $36 million consisting of non-cash write offs of unamortized bond discounts and issuance costs as well as payments of redemption premiums and fees.  Guarantees  As of December 31,
2016, American had issued guarantees covering AAG’s $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 2019, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due 2018 and $500 million aggregate
principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2020.  Collateral-Related Covenants 
Certain of American’s debt financing agreements contain loan to value (LTV) ratio covenants and require
American to annually appraise the related collateral. Pursuant to such agreements, if the LTV

ratio exceeds a specified threshold, American is required, as applicable, to pledge additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash collateral), or pay down such financing,
in whole or in part.  Specifically, American is required to meet certain collateral coverage tests on an
annual basis for four credit facilities, as described below:

 American provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets, which include
the NOLs, when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. American
considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions in evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax assets. Many factors are considered that impact American’s projections of future profitability,
including risks associated with remaining Merger integration activities as well as other conditions which are beyond its control, such as the health of the economy, the level and volatility of fuel prices and travel demand. 
In connection with the preparation of American’s financial statements at the end of 2015, American determined
that after considering all positive and negative evidence, including the completion of certain critical Merger integration milestones as well as its financial performance, it was more likely than not that substantially all of its deferred income tax
assets, which include its NOLs, would be realized. Accordingly, American reversed $3.5 billion of the valuation allowance, which resulted in a special non-cash tax benefit recorded in the consolidated
statement of operations.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, American recorded a
$320 million tax provision. During 2014, American sold its portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. In connection with this sale, American recorded a special non-cash tax provision of $328 million in the second quarter of 2014 that reversed the non-cash tax provision which was recorded in OCI, a subset of stockholder’s
equity, principally in 2009. This provision represents the tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of American’s fuel hedging contracts. In accordance with GAAP, American
retained the $328 million tax provision in OCI until the last contract was settled or terminated. 
In addition to the changes in the valuation allowance from operations described in the table above, the valuation
allowance was also impacted by the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), described in Note 8. The total decrease in the valuation allowance was $1 million, $5.2 billion and $525 million in 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively.

 At December 31, 2016, American had approximately $11.3 billion of gross

NOL Carryforwards available in those returns is $10.5 billion, substantially all of which is expected to be available for use in 2017. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in 2022 if unused. American also had approximately
$3.4 billion of NOL Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2016, which will expire in years 2017 through 2034 if unused. American’s ability to deduct its NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other
available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 where an “ownership change” has occurred. Substantially all of American’s remaining federal NOL Carryforwards
(attributable to US Airways Group) are subject to limitation under Section 382; however, American’s ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. American elected
to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that permitted approximately $9.5 billion (with $9.3 billion of unlimited NOL still remaining at December 31, 2016) of its federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized
without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. American’s ability to utilize any new NOL Carryforwards arising after the ownership changes is not
affected by the annual limitation rules imposed by Section 382 unless another future ownership change occurs. Under the Section 382 limitation, cumulative stock ownership changes among material stockholders exceeding 50% during a rolling
three-year period can potentially limit a company’s future use of NOLs and tax credits. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards may be limited” for unaudited additional
discussion of this risk.  At December 31, 2016, American had an AMT credit carryforward of
approximately $452 million available for federal income tax purposes, which is available for an indefinite period.

In 2016, American recorded an income tax provision with an
effective rate of approximately 37%, which was substantially non-cash as American utilized the NOLs described above. Substantially all of American’s income before income taxes is attributable to the
United States.  American files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in
which it operates. American’s 2013 through 2015 tax years are still subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Various state and foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination and American is under examination, in
administrative appeals, or engaged in tax litigation in certain jurisdictions. American believes that the effect of any assessments will not be material to its consolidated financial statements. 
The amount of, and changes to, American’s uncertain tax positions were not material in any of the years
presented. American accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.  5.  Risk Management  American’s
economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables it cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel.  Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending, airline industry revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the
world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel and changes in booking practices, both of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong
negative effect on American’s revenues. In addition, during challenging economic times, actions by its competitors to increase their revenues can have an adverse impact on American’s revenues. 
American’s operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost
of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in American’s business. Jet fuel market prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years and prices continue to be highly volatile. Because of the amount of
fuel needed to operate American’s business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of fuel can have a material effect on American’s operating results and liquidity. 
These additional factors could impact American’s results of operations, financial performance and liquidity:
 (a) Credit Risk  Most of American’s receivables relate to tickets sold to individual passengers through the use of major credit cards or to tickets sold by other airlines and used by passengers on American.
These receivables are short-term, mostly settled within seven days after sale. Bad debt losses, which have been minimal in the past, have been considered in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts. American does not believe it is subject to
any significant concentration of credit risk.  (b) Interest Rate Risk 
American has exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to its variable
rate debt obligations. Interest rates on $9.6 billion principal amount of long-term debt as of 
  160

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.
  

December 31, 2016 are subject to adjustment to reflect changes in floating interest rates. The weighted average effective interest rate on American’s variable rate debt was 3.1% at
December 31, 2016. American does not currently have an interest rate hedge program.  (c) Foreign Currency
Risk  American is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar
value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. American’s largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar and various Latin American currencies, primarily the Brazilian real. American does not
currently have a foreign currency hedge program. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the
future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control” for unaudited additional discussion of this risk.  6.  Fair Value Measurements  Assets Measured at
Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from
the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. an exit price) on the measurement date in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Accounting standards
include disclosure requirements around fair values used for certain financial instruments and establish a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes valuation inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair
value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of three levels:   


 
•
 
 Level 1 – Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
 


 
•
 
 Level 2 – Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
  


 
•
 
 Level 3 – Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own
assumptions.  When available, American uses quoted market prices to determine the fair
value of its financial assets. If quoted market prices are not available, American measures fair value using valuation techniques that use, when possible, current market-based or independently-sourced market parameters, such as interest rates and
currency rates.  American utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets.
The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. American’s short-term investments classified as Level 2 primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active market for valuation of these securities. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Level 1 to Level 2 transfers during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.  Fair Value of Debt
 The fair value of American’s long-term debt was estimated using quoted market prices or
discounted cash flow analyses, based on American’s current estimated incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. If American’s long-term debt was measured at fair value, it would have been classified as
Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

 7.  Employee Benefit Plans 
American sponsors defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for eligible employees. The defined benefit
pension plans provide benefits for participating employees based on years of service and average compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. Effective November 1, 2012, substantially all of American’s defined benefit
pension plans were frozen and American began providing enhanced benefits under its defined contribution pension plans for certain groups. American uses a December 31 measurement date for all of its defined benefit pension plans. American also
provides certain retiree medical and other postretirement benefits, including health care and life insurance benefits, to retired employees. Effective November 1, 2012, American modified its retiree medical and other postretirement benefits
plans to eliminate the company subsidy for employees who retire on or after November 1, 2012. As a result of modifications to its retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans in 2012, American recognized a negative plan amendment of
$1.9 billion, which is included as a component of actuarial gain in OCI and will be amortized over the future service life of the active plan participants for whom the benefit was eliminated, or approximately eight years. As of
December 31, 2016, $871 million of actuarial gain remains to be amortized.

 The 2016, 2015 and 2014 prior service cost does not include amortization of $1 million, $3 million and $14 million,
respectively, related to other postretirement benefits.  The estimated amount of
unrecognized net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is $144 million. 
The estimated amount of unrecognized net gain for the retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans that
will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is $23 million.  Assumptions  The following actuarial

 The weighted average health care cost trend rate at December 31, 2016 is assumed to decline gradually to 3.77% by 2024 and remain level
thereafter.  As of December 31, 2016, American’s estimate of the long-term
rate of return on plan assets was 8% based on the target asset allocation. Expected returns on long duration bonds are based on yields to maturity of the bonds held at year-end. Expected returns on other
assets are based on a combination of long-term historical returns, actual returns on plan assets achieved over the last ten years, current and expected market conditions, and expected value to be generated through active management, currency overlay
and securities lending programs.  A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend
rates would have the following effects on American’s retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans (in millions):

Minimum Contributions 
American is required to make minimum contributions to its defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and various other laws for U.S. based plans as well as under funding rules specific to countries where American maintains defined benefit plans. Based on current funding
assumptions, American has minimum required contributions of $25 million for 2017. American expects to make supplemental contributions of $254 million to its U.S. based defined benefit plans in 2017. Currently, the minimum funding
obligation for American’s U.S. based defined benefit pension plans is subject to temporary favorable rules that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. American’s pension funding obligations are likely to increase materially following
expiration of the temporary funding rules, when American will be required to make contributions relating to the 2018 fiscal year. The amount of these obligations will depend on the performance of American’s investments held in trust by the
pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities, the amount of and timing of any supplemental contributions and American’s actuarial experience.  Benefit Payments  The following benefit
payments, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid (approximately, in millions):

 Plan Assets 
The objectives of American’s investment policies are to: maintain sufficient income and liquidity to pay
retirement benefits; produce a long-term rate of return that meets or exceeds the assumed rate of return for plan assets; limit the volatility of asset performance and funded status; and diversify assets among asset classes and investment managers.
 Based on these investment objectives, a long-term strategic asset allocation has been established. This
strategic allocation seeks to balance the potential benefit of improving funded position with the potential risk that the funded position would decline. The current strategic target asset allocation is as follows:

Public equity and emerging market fixed income securities are used
to provide diversification and are expected to generate higher returns over the long-term than U.S. long duration bonds. Public stocks are managed using a value investment approach in order to participate in the returns generated by stocks in the
long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. U.S. long duration bonds are used to partially hedge the assets from declines in interest rates. Alternative (private) investments are used to provide expected returns in excess of the public
markets over the long-term. Additionally, the pension plan’s master trust engages currency overlay managers in an attempt to increase returns by protecting non-U.S. dollar denominated assets from a rise
in the relative value of the U.S. dollar. The pension plan’s master trust also participates in securities lending programs to generate additional income by loaning plan assets to borrowers on a fully collateralized basis. These programs are
subject to market risk.  Investments in securities traded on recognized securities exchanges are valued
at the last reported sales price on the last business day of the year. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at the last bid price. The money
market fund is valued at fair value which represents the net asset value of the shares of such fund as of the close of business at the end of the period. Investments in limited partnerships are carried at estimated net asset value as determined by
and reported by the general partners of the partnerships and represent the proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the limited partnerships. Common/collective trusts are valued at net asset value based on the fair
values of the underlying investments of the trusts as determined by the sponsor of the trusts. The pension plan’s master trust also invests in a 103-12 investment entity (the 103-12 Investment Trust) which is designed to invest plan assets of more than one unrelated employer. The 103-12 Investment Trust is valued at net asset value which is
determined by the issuer at the end of each month and is based on the aggregate fair value of trust assets less liabilities, divided by the number of units outstanding. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the year.

 Investments in the retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans’
mutual funds are valued by quoted prices on the active market, which is fair value and represents the net asset value of the shares of such funds as of the close of business at the end of the period. AMR Class shares are offered without a sales
charge to participants. Purchases are restricted to certain retirement benefit plans, including American’s retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans, resulting in a fair value classification of Level 2. Investments include
approximately 27% of investments in non-U.S. common stocks in each of 2016 and 2015. Net asset value is based on the fair market value of the funds’ underlying assets and liabilities at the date of
determination.  Profit Sharing Program 
American instituted an employee profit sharing program effective on January 1, 2016 and accrues 5% of its pre-tax income excluding special items to distribute to employees in early 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, American accrued $314 million for this program.

 (c) Capacity Purchase Agreements with Third-Party Regional Carriers 
American has capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. The capacity purchase agreements
provide that all revenues, including passenger, in-flight, ancillary, mail and

freight revenues, go to American. In return, American agrees to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of
passengers on board. In addition, these agreements provide that American reimburses 100% of certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees and passenger liability insurance. American controls marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat
inventories.  As of December 31, 2016, American’s capacity purchase agreements with
third-party regional carriers had expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2027, with rights of American to extend the respective terms of certain agreements. See Part I, Item 2. Properties for unaudited information on the aircraft operated by
third-party regional carriers under such capacity purchase agreements.  As of December 31, 2016,
American’s minimum fixed obligations under its capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers are as follows (approximately, in millions):

to be leased in the amount of approximately $434 million in 2017, $370 million in 2018, $349 million in 2019, $317 million in 2020, $280 million in 2021 and $927 million in 2022 and thereafter.
 (d) Operating Leases 
American leases certain aircraft, engines and ground equipment, in addition to the majority of its ground facilities
and terminal space. As of December 31, 2016, American had 408 aircraft under operating leases, with remaining terms ranging from three months to approximately 11 years. Airports are utilized for flight operations under lease arrangements with
the municipalities or agencies owning or controlling such airports. Substantially all leases provide that the lessee must pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other operating expenses applicable to the leased property. Some leases also
include renewal and purchase options.  As of December 31, 2016, obligations under noncancellable
operating leases for future minimum lease payments are as follows (approximately, in millions):

(e) Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 Aircraft  American currently operates 346 owned aircraft and 138 leased aircraft which were financed with EETCs issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are
off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance the acquisition of flight equipment. Rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or
refinanced, these trusts allow American to raise the financing for a number of aircraft at one time and, if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. The trusts were also
structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to
American.  Each trust covers a set number of aircraft scheduled to be delivered or refinanced upon the
issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or
held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft. The equipment notes are issued, at American’s election, in connection with a mortgage financing of
the aircraft or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leases the aircraft to American. In both cases, the
equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes
issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have been guaranteed by AAG. As of December 31, 2016, $10.9 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet.  With respect to leveraged leases, American evaluated whether the leases had
characteristics of a variable interest entity. American concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities. American generally is not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with
market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates American to absorb decreases in value or entitles American to participate in increases in the
value of the aircraft. American does not provide residual value guarantees to the bondholders or equity participants in the trusts. Some leases have a fair market value or a fixed price purchase option that allows American to purchase the aircraft
at or near the end of the lease term. However, the option price approximates an estimate of the aircraft’s fair value at the option date. Under this feature, American does not participate in any increases in the value of the aircraft. American
concluded it is not the primary beneficiary under these arrangements. Therefore, American accounts for its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American’s total future obligations under these leveraged lease financings are
$1.5 billion as of December 31, 2016, which are included in the future minimum lease payments table above. 
Special Facility Revenue Bonds 
American guarantees the payment of principal and interest of certain special facility revenue bonds issued by
municipalities primarily to build or improve airport facilities and purchase equipment which is leased to American. Under such leases, American is required to make rental payments through 2035, sufficient to pay maturing principal and interest
payments on the related bonds. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining lease payments guaranteeing the principal and interest on these bonds are $605 million, which are accounted for as operating leases.

(f) Legal Proceedings 
Chapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011, AMR, American, and certain of AMR’s other direct and
indirect domestic subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On
October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors’ fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their
reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the Merger.  Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy
Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of December 31, 2016, there
were approximately 25.2 million shares of AAG common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on the same basis as if
such distributions had been made on or about the Effective Date. However, American is not required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully
pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to American but rather will be distributed to former
AMR stockholders.  There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an
action brought by American to seek a determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated without liability to American. On
April 18, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court granted American’s motion for summary judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that their benefits were not vested and could be
terminated. The summary judgment motion was denied with respect to all other retirees. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits concerning whether those retirees’ benefits are vested, and American cannot predict whether
it will receive relief from obligations to provide benefits to any of those retirees. American’s financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or termination of benefits that may
ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome of this proceeding.  DOJ Antitrust Civil
Investigative Demand. In June 2015, American received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air
passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information from American, and other airlines have announced that they have received similar requests. American is cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to
announcement of the delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, American, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100
putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On October 28, 2016, the Court denied a
motion by the airline defendants to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ investigation and these lawsuits are in their relatively early stages and American intends to defend these matters vigorously. 
Private Party Antitrust Action. On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US
Airways Group, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of 
  177

California. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group and US Airways, Inc., alleged that the effect of the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the
Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On
November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On August 19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion
for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a
request with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was denied on October 15, 2015. A jointly proposed schedule for the remainder of the case was submitted
on September 7, 2016, which has not yet been accepted by the Bankruptcy Court. American believes this lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the allegations. 
DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal Service. In April 2015, the DOJ informed American of
an inquiry regarding American’s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air. In October 2015, American received a CID from the DOJ seeking certain information relating to
these contracts and the DOJ has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is investigating potential violations of the False Claims Act or other statutes. American
is cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its investigation.  General. In addition to the
specifically identified legal proceedings, American and its subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome
depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within American’s control. Therefore, although American will vigorously defend itself in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution
and potential financial and other impacts on American are uncertain but could be material. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors —“We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our
financial position and liquidity” for unaudited additional discussion.  (g) Guarantees and
Indemnifications  American is a party to many routine contracts in which it provides general
indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various risks. American is not able to estimate the potential amount of any liability resulting from the indemnities. These indemnities are discussed in the following paragraphs.
 In its aircraft financing agreements, American generally indemnifies the financing parties, trustees
acting on their behalf and other relevant parties against liabilities (including certain taxes) resulting from the financing, manufacture, design, ownership, operation and maintenance of the aircraft regardless of whether these liabilities (or
taxes) relate to the negligence of the indemnified parties.  American’s loan agreements and other
LIBOR-based financing transactions (including certain leveraged aircraft leases) generally obligate American to reimburse the applicable lender for incremental costs due to a change in law that imposes (i) any reserve or special deposit
requirement against assets of, deposits with or credit extended by such lender related to the loan, (ii) any tax, duty or other charge with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (iii) capital adequacy requirements. In
addition, American’s loan agreements and other financing arrangements typically 
  178



Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.
  

contain a withholding tax provision that requires American to pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other financing party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender
or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law.  These increased cost and
withholding tax provisions continue for the entire term of the applicable transaction, and there is no limitation on the maximum additional amounts American could be obligated to pay under such provisions. Any failure to pay amounts due under such
provisions generally would trigger an event of default and, in a secured financing transaction, would entitle the lender to foreclose on the collateral to realize the amount due. 
In certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing leases and loans, the lessors, lenders and/or other
parties have rights to terminate the transaction based on changes in foreign tax law, illegality or certain other events or circumstances. In such a case, American may be required to make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant transaction.
 American has general indemnity clauses in many of its airport and other real estate leases where
American as lessee indemnifies the lessor (and related parties) against liabilities related to American’s use of the leased property. Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities resulting from the negligence of the indemnified parties,
but not liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified parties. In addition, American provides environmental indemnities in many of these leases for contamination related to American’s use of the leased
property.  Under certain contracts with third parties, American indemnifies the third-party against
legal liability arising out of an action by the third-party, or certain other parties. The terms of these contracts vary and the potential exposure under these indemnities cannot be determined. American has liability insurance protecting American
for some of the obligations it has undertaken under these indemnities.  American is involved in certain
claims and litigation related to its operations. American is also subject to regulatory assessments in the ordinary course of business. American establishes reserves for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies
that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, liabilities, if any, arising from these regulatory matters, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on American’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows, after consideration of available insurance.  As of
December 31, 2016, American had issued guarantees covering AAG’s $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 2019, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due 2018 and
$500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2020.  (h) Credit Card Processing
Agreements  American has agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions
for the sale of air travel and other services. American’s agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of its cash (referred to as a holdback) equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been
processed by that company, but for which American has not yet provided the air transportation. Additional holdback requirements in the event of material adverse changes in American’s financial condition will reduce its liquidity in the form of
unrestricted cash by the amount of the holdbacks. American is not currently required to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements.

(i) Labor Negotiations 
As of December 31, 2016, American employed approximately 101,500 active full-time equivalent employees.
Approximately 84% of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. Negotiations for joint collective bargaining agreements covering American’s maintenance, fleet service, stores and planner employees are
continuing. There is no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of these labor negotiations will be achieved. 
(j) Other  As a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent liability protections provided for by the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Stabilization
Act), American recorded a liability for these terrorist attacks claims equal to the related insurance receivable due to American. The Stabilization Act provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, liability for all claims, whether
compensatory or punitive, arising from these terrorist attacks, against any air carrier shall not exceed the liability coverage maintained by the air carrier. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining liability and the amount of the offsetting
receivable were each $974 million.  10.  Supplemental Cash Flow Information

 11.  Operating Segments and Related Disclosures 
American is managed as a single business unit that provides air transportation for passengers and cargo. This allows
it to benefit from an integrated revenue pricing and route network that includes American and AAG’s wholly-owned and third-party regional carriers that fly under capacity purchase agreements operating as American Eagle. The flight equipment of
all these carriers is combined to form one fleet that is deployed through a single route scheduling system. When making resource allocation decisions, the chief operating decision maker evaluates flight profitability data, which considers aircraft
type and route economics, but gives no weight to the financial impact of the resource allocation decision on an individual carrier basis. The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximize consolidated financial results, not the
individual results of American or American Eagle.

 American attributes operating revenues by geographic region based upon the origin
and destination of each flight segment. American’s tangible assets consist primarily of flight equipment, which are mobile across geographic markets and, therefore, have not been allocated. 
12.  Share-based Compensation  The 2013 AAG Incentive Award Plan (the 2013 Plan) provides that awards may be in the form of an option, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit award, performance award, dividend equivalent
award, deferred stock award, deferred stock unit award, stock payment award or stock appreciation right. The 2013 Plan authorizes the grant of awards for the issuance of 40 million shares. Any shares underlying awards granted under the 2013
Plan, or any pre-existing US Airways Group plan, that are forfeited, terminate or are settled in cash (in whole or in part) without the delivery of shares will again be available for grant. 
American’s net income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included $102 million,
$274 million and $381 million, respectively, of share-based compensation costs. Of the 2015 and 2014 amounts, $198 million and $224 million, respectively, were related to awards granted to certain employees in connection with the
Merger and recorded in special items, net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
During 2016, 2015 and 2014, AAG withheld approximately 1.4 million, 7.0 million and 1.7 million
shares of AAG common stock, respectively, and paid approximately $56 million, $306 million and $62 million, respectively, in satisfaction of certain tax withholding obligations associated with employee equity awards. 
(a) Restricted Stock Unit Awards (RSUs) 
AAG has granted RSUs with service conditions (time vested primarily over three years) and performance conditions.
The grant-date fair value of RSUs is equal to the market price of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of grant. For time vested awards, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award.
For awards with performance conditions, the expense is recognized based on the expected achievement at each reporting period. Stock-settled RSUs are classified as equity awards as the vesting results in the issuance of shares of AAG common stock.
Cash-settled restricted stock unit awards (CRSUs) are classified as liability awards as the vesting results in payment of cash by AAG.

 As of December 31, 2016, there was $116 million of unrecognized
compensation cost related to stock-settled RSUs. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of one year. The total fair value of stock-settled RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was
$107 million, $750 million and $154 million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2016,
AAG had a nominal amount of CRSUs outstanding. The total cash paid for CRSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was less than $1 million, $10 million and $12 million, respectively. 
(b) Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights 
AAG assumed US Airways Group’s outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights in connection with the
Merger using an exchange ratio of one to one. These stock options and stock appreciation rights were granted with an exercise price equal to the underlying common stock’s fair value at the date of each grant, have service conditions, become
exercisable over a three-year vesting period and expire if unexercised at the end of their term, which ranges from seven to ten years. Stock options and stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) are classified as equity awards as the exercise
results in the issuance of shares of AAG common stock. Cash-settled stock appreciation rights (CSARs) are classified as liability awards as the exercise results in payment of cash by AAG. Compensation costs were expensed on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period for the entire award. There are no unrecognized compensation costs as all awards outstanding are vested.

 American’s fourth quarter 2016 results include $273 million of total net
special charges consisting principally of $121 million of Merger integration expenses, $104 million of fleet restructuring expenses and a $47 million net charge consisting of mark-to-market adjustments for bankruptcy obligations. 
American’s fourth quarter 2015 results include $2.5 billion of total net special credits consisting
principally of a $3.5 billion non-cash tax benefit recorded in connection with the reversal of American’s tax valuation allowance, offset in part by a nonoperating net special charge of
$592 million to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by American due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela and $447 million in total operating special charges primarily
consisting of Merger integration expenses and fleet restructuring expenses.  15.  Transactions with Related Parties

(1) 

 The increase in American’s net related party receivable from AAG is primarily due to American providing the cash funding for AAG’s
share repurchase and dividend programs.   


(2) 

 The net payable to AAG’s wholly-owned subsidiaries consists primarily of amounts due under regional capacity purchase agreements with
AAG’s wholly-owned regional airlines operating under the brand name of American Eagle.  Pursuant to a capacity purchase agreement between American and AAG’s wholly-owned regional airlines operating as American Eagle, American purchases all of the capacity from these carriers and
recognizes passenger revenue from flights operated by American Eagle. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, American recognized expense of approximately $1.5 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, related to wholly-owned regional
airline capacity purchase agreements.

16.  Subsequent Events 
2017-1 EETCs 
In January 2017, American created three pass-through trusts which issued approximately $983 million aggregate
principal amount of Series 2017-1 Class AA, Class A and Class B EETCs (the 2017-1 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 24 aircraft scheduled to be
delivered to American between January 2017 and May 2017 (the 2017-1 Aircraft). A portion of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2017-1 EETCs has been used to
acquire Series AA, A and B equipment notes issued by American to the pass-through trusts and the balance of such proceeds is being held in escrow for the benefit of the holders of the 2017-1 EETCs until such
time as American issues additional Series AA, A and B equipment notes to the pass-through trusts, which will purchase the equipment notes with escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on its
consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depository are not American’s assets. 
Series AA equipment notes bear interest at 3.65% per annum, Series A equipment notes bear interest at 4.00% per
annum and Series B equipment notes bear interest at 4.95% per annum. Interest and principal payments on the equipment notes will be payable semi-annually in February and August of each year, with interest payments beginning in August 2017 and
principal payments beginning in February 2018. The final payments on the Series AA and Series A equipment notes are due in February 2029 and the final payment on the Series B equipment notes is due in February 2025. The equipment notes are secured
by liens on the 2017-1 Aircraft.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON
ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE  None. 
 


ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES  Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  The term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act. This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the SEC. An evaluation of the effectiveness of AAG’s and American’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016 was performed under the supervision and with the participation of
AAG’s and American’s management, including AAG’s and American’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Based on that evaluation, AAG’s and American’s management, including AAG’s and
American’s CEO and CFO, concluded that AAG’s and American’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  On December 9, 2013, AAG acquired US Airways Group and its subsidiaries. We are still in the process of integrating certain processes, technology and operations for the post-Merger combined
company, and we will continue to evaluate the impact of any related changes to our internal control over financial reporting. For the year ended December 31, 2016, there has been no change in AAG’s or American’s internal control over
financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AAG’s and American’s internal control over financial reporting.  Limitation on the Effectiveness of Controls  We
believe that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the CEO and CFO of AAG and American believe that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective at the “reasonable assurance” level as of December 31, 2016.  Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Management of AAG and American is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
AAG’s and American’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP. AAG’s and American’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:   


 
•
 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of AAG or American, respectively;   


 
•
 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of AAG or American are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of AAG or American, respectively; and 
  187



Table of Contents


 
•
 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of AAG’s or
American’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of AAG’s and American’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal Control – Integrated Framework
(2013 Framework).  Based on our assessment and those criteria, AAG’s and American’s management
concludes that AAG and American, respectively, maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.  AAG’s and American’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of AAG’s and American’s internal control over financial
reporting. That report has been included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders  American Airlines Group Inc.:  We have audited American Airlines Group
Inc.’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 In our opinion, American Airlines Group Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity (deficit) for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, and our report dated February 22, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
