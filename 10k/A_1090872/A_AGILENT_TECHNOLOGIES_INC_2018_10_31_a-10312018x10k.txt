A significant number of our Agilent CrossLab customers are also customers of our life sciences and applied markets business.The service and consumables business is mostly recurring in nature, and is not as susceptible to market seasonality and industry cycles in comparison to our instrument businesses.  The vendor neutral portion of the portfolio allows the business to perform relatively independent from our instrument business.Agilent CrossLab Sales, Marketing and SupportWe deploy a multi-channel approach, marketing products and services to our customers through direct sales, electronic commerce, resellers, manufacturers' representatives and distributors. We primarily use direct sales to market our solutions to our large accounts. Sales agents supplement direct sales by providing broader geographic coverage and coverage of smaller accounts. Our active reseller program augments our ability to provide more complete solutions to our customers. We utilize telesales to enhance the transactional sales model of our products.  All channels are supported by technical product and application specialists to meet our customer’s specific requirements.We deliver our support services to customers in a variety of ways, including on-site assistance with repair or exchange of returned products, telephone support and self-diagnostic services provided over the Internet.

Our products typically come with standard warranties, and extended warranties are available for additional cost.Agilent CrossLab ManufacturingOur primary manufacturing sites for the consumables business are in California and Delaware in the U.S., and in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom outside of the U.S.  Our direct service delivery organization is regionally based operating in 30 countries.11Table of Contents            Agilent CrossLab CompetitionOur principal competitors in the services and consumable products arena include many of our competitors from the instrument business, such as: Danaher Corporation, PerkinElmer, Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Waters Corporation, as well as numerous niche consumables and service providers.  Agilent competes on the basis of product performance, reliability, support quality, applications expertise, global channel coverage and price.Agilent Technologies Research LaboratoriesAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories ("Research Labs") is our research organization based in Santa Clara, California. The Research Labs create competitive advantage through high-impact technology, driving market leadership and growth in Agilent's core businesses and expanding Agilent's footprint into adjacent markets. At the cross-roads of the organization, the Research Labs are able to identify and enable synergies across Agilent's businesses to create competitive differentiation and compelling customer value.The technical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific and engineering fields, including biology, chemistry, distributed measurement, image processing, mathematics, nano/microfabrication, microfluidics, software, physics and physiology. Global Infrastructure OrganizationWe provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, tax, treasury, legal, real estate, insurance services, workplace services, human resources, information technology   services,  order administration and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Generally, these organizations are managed from Santa Clara, California, with operations and services provided worldwide. As of the end of October 2018, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 2,700 people worldwide.Agilent Order Fulfillment OrganizationsOur order fulfillment and supply chain organization (“OFS”) focuses on order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our businesses. OFS provides resources for manufacturing, engineering and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses. In general, OFS employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses.        The following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental and Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.Research and DevelopmentWe anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions, life sciences and diagnostics. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share.BacklogWe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarter's orders.  Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.Intellectual Property We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in 12Table of Contents            general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.Materials Our life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address any potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.EnvironmentalOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. We believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws.We maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.Acquisition and Disposal of Material AssetsIn 2018, we acquired seven businesses, for a combined purchase price of approximately $536 million. The largest of which was Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc. ("AATI") for approximately $268 million in cash. These acquisitions were not material individually or in aggregate.Executive Officers of the Registrant The names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:Henrik Ancher-Jensen, 53, has served as Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Order Fulfillment since September 2013.  From September 2012 to September 2013, Mr. Ancher-Jensen served as our Vice President, Global Product Supply, Diagnostics and Genomics Group.  From September 2010 to September 2012 he served as Corporate Vice President, Global Operations of Dako A/S, a Danish diagnostics company, and as Dako’s Vice President, Supply Chain and Chief Information Officer from 2006 to September 2010.  Prior to joining Dako, he spent more than 15 years in senior management roles and management consulting with Chr.

Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer.We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;•innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;•appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;•manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;•price our products competitively;•anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and•control product quality in our manufacturing process.In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or providing drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures. General economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:•reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;•increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increased price pressure for our products and services; and•greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.15Table of Contents            Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses.Demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.Our customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.   Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has increased revenues by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2018. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue it will also have a negative impact on our costs and expenses. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:•interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;•changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;•changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new or different customs duties trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers;•tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs recently enacted and proposed by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remains uncertain;•negative consequences from changes in tax laws;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•differing protection of intellectual property;•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and•geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war.We sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from various countries.  Tariffs recently announced and implemented could have negative impact on our business, results of operations and 16Table of Contents            financial condition.  Further, additional tariffs which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We centralized most of our accounting and tax processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivables and tax functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.Our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.We have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future.  These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases.  In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions.  Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition.Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.Our acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term.  We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result in, unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment.Integrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks.  Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business models, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodologies and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to 17Table of Contents            certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.Even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions.A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.  In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud.  We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.  Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.Our customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business.  The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to EU customers and workers. The GDPR established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.We must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us 18Table of Contents            to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer.Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.A number of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.Some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.Some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.Our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.We derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension from future government contracting.  If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. 19Table of Contents            In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.Our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.We have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.The impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.The life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.If we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.Although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have been consolidating, and may continue to consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.Our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins, and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics 20Table of Contents            providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology ("IT") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities.Certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contaminations.  Although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties, we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled.  In other cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination, including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc.  Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed, or provided indemnities for, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters.  Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.Our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve, or have involved, the use of certain substances regulated under various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.  Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanction, including fines, penalties or suspensions.  If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.   Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.We are subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule, which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31st of each year, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  In addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or 21Table of Contents            could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all.Third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.Our pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.We may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. The 2017 United States Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) significantly changed the taxation of U.S. based multinational corporations.  Our compliance with the Tax Act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions.  The implementation of the Tax Act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state tax authorities.  The legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation.  As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Act, and as we gather information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position.We are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition.If tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.We benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we 22Table of Contents            may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.We have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.We currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion in senior unsecured notes. We also are party to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in September 2019.  On June 9, 2015, we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by $300 million and on July 14, 2017, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $1 billion.  As of October 31, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.Our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:•increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions; •requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.Our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters, and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time.  If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers 23Table of Contents            or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.As of October 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2,247 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial condition.We could incur significant liabilities if the distribution of Keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.We have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of Keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters.  If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.   Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.We cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2.

("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.In 2018, we acquired seven businesses for a combined purchase price of approximately $536 million. The largest of which was Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc. ("AATI") for approximately $268 million in cash. On November 14, 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of ACEA Biosciences Inc. ("ACEA"), a developer of cell analysis tools, for $250 million in cash. The financial results of ACEA will be included within our financial results from the date of the close. In 2017, we acquired two businesses for a combined purchase price of approximately $125 million in cash. Agilent's net revenue of $4,914 million in 2018 increased 10 percent when compared to 2017. Foreign currency movements for 2018 had an overall favorable impact on revenue of approximately 2 percentage points compared to 2017. Acquisitions in 2018 had an overall favorable impact of 1 percentage point when compared to 2017. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 9 percent in 2018 when compared to 2017. Foreign currency movements had an favorable impact on revenue of 2 percentage points in 2018 when compared to 2017.  Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business  increased 10 percent in 2018 when compared to 2017. Foreign currency movements had an favorable impact on revenue of 3 percentage points in 2018 when compared to 2017. Revenue in the Agilent CrossLab business increased 11 percent in 2018 when compared to 2017. Foreign currency movements had an favorable impact on revenue of 2 percentage points in 2018 when compared to 2017. Agilent's net revenue of $4,472 million increased 6 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements for 2017 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately 1 percentage point compared to 2016. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 4 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of less than 1 percentage point in 2017 when compared to 2016. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business increased 9 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements had no overall impact on revenue in 2017 when compared to 2016. Revenue in the Agilent CrossLab business increased 8 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of less than 1 percentage point in 2017 when compared to 2016. Net income was $316 million in 2018 compared to net income of $684 million and $462 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net income for the year ended October 31, 2018 was impacted by a  discrete tax charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act passed on December 22, 2017. See  Note 4, "Income Taxes" for more details.  As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $2,247 million and $2,678 million, respectively.  On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The program was designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive 29Table of Contents            programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares.  For the year ended October 31, 2016 we repurchased 2 million shares for $98 million which completed the purchases under this authorization.On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2015 repurchase program"). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  During the year ended October 31, 2016,  upon the completion of our previous repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares for $336 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares for $194 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2018 we repurchased and retired approximately 6.4 million shares for $422 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2018, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $188 million of our common stock under this program which expired on November 1, 2018.On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2019 repurchase program") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time.   During the year ended October 31, 2018, cash dividends of $0.596 per share, or $191 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2017, cash dividends of $0.528 per share, or $170 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2016, cash dividends of $0.460 per share, or $150 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. On November 14, 2018 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.164 per share of common stock, or approximately $52 million which will be paid on January 23, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2018. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.Looking forward, we continue to focus on differentiating product solutions, improving our customers' experience and  growing our operating margin. In addition, we remain focused on a balanced capital allocation through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenue in 2019 but we also anticipate the contribution from our recent acquisitions to partially offset the currency impact.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.  An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes.Revenue Recognition.    We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. We allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. We determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party 30Table of Contents            evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules. Revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. The amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements.The aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.Inventory Valuation.    We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. Share-Based Compensation.    We account for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Under the authoritative guidance, share-based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight-line basis. The fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock options were granted in years prior to fiscal year 2016. Shares granted under the Long-Term Performance Program based on Total Shareholders Return ("LTPP-TSR") were valued using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards, LTPP based on Operating Margin (“LTPP-OM”) and LTPP based on Earnings per share (“LTPP-EPS”) is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. The compensation cost for LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period. In the case of LTPP-OM, the performance targets for all the three years of performance period is set at the time of grant. The performance targets for LTPP-EPS grants for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period will be set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3, respectively. The probable shares to vest are estimated based on the forecasted OM and EPS at the time of the grant and updated every quarter with latest forecast and actual information. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date. All awards granted after 2015 to our senior management employees have a one year post-vest holding restriction. The estimated discount associated with post-vest holding restrictions is calculated using the Finnerty model.Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. For LTPP (TSR) grants in 2016, we used the 3-year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies. We believed our historical volatility prior to the separation of Keysight in 2015 was no longer relevant to use. For the 2017 and 2018 LTPP (TSR) grants and calculation of the post-vest discount using the Finnerty model, we used our own post-separation historical stock price volatility. See Note 3, "Share-based Compensation," to the consolidated financial statements for more information. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results.Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions.    Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2018 and 2017, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. In 2018, discount rates for the U.S. plans 31Table of Contents            increased compared to the previous year. For 2018 and 2017, the discount rate for non-U.S. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2018, slightly increased compared to the previous year. If we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be less than $1 million in U.S. pension expense and $16 million on non-U.S. pension expense. Lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense.The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $4 million on U.S. pension expense and $9 million on non-U.S. pension expense. For 2018, actual return on assets was below expectations which, along with contributions during the year, increased next year’s pension cost as well as resulting in a decrease of the funded status at year end. The net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded were a $3 million benefit in 2018, $15 million benefit in 2017 and $3 million expense in 2016. The years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, included a gain on curtailment and settlements of $5 million,  $32 million and $16 million, respectively.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.  In fiscal year 2018, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2018. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. In-process research and development ("IPR&D") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable.32Table of Contents            Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2018. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. During the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Based on triggering events in the year ended October 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment of $4 million due to the cancellation of certain IPR&D projects.Accounting for Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate.  The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.  We monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis.  If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. At October 31, 2018, we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain U.S. and U.S state and foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law.  The Tax Act significantly changes the existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business.  ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment.  However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date.   We have recognized the tax charge of $499 million due to transition tax liability and $53 million due to the impact of reduction in U.S. tax rates in the period when the tax law was enacted as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations. We have completed the accounting for all the impacts of the Tax Act except for the policy election for the treatment of the tax on global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”) inclusions. See Note 4, "Income Taxes" for more details. These computations are based on the regulations and guidance already provided by federal and state tax authorities. The company will continue to assess the impact of the further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on its business and consolidated financial statements. Any future adjustments will be recognized as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period the adjustments are determined.33Table of Contents            Adoption of New PronouncementsSee Note 2, "New Accounting Pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.Foreign CurrencyOur revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. The favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has increased revenue by approximately 2 percentage point for the year ended October 31, 2018. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue it will also have a negative impact on our costs and expenses. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 1 percentage point for the year ended October 31, 2017.   When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses. We calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve-month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction. Results from OperationsNet Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2018 over 2017% Change 2017 over 2016   % Change 2018 2017 2016  (in millions)    Net revenue:         Products$3,746 $3,397 $3,213 10% 6%Services and other$1,168 $1,075 $989 9% 9%Total net revenue$4,914 $4,472 $4,202 10% 6%  Years Ended October 31, 2018 over 2017ppts Change 2017 over 2016ppts Change 2018 2017 2016 % of total net revenue:         Products76% 76% 76% — —Services and other24% 24% 24% — —Total100% 100% 100%    Agilent's net revenue of $4,914 million in October 31, 2018 increased 10 percent when compared to 2017.

Income Taxes Years Ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Provision for income taxes$630 $119 $82For 2018, the company's income tax expense was $630 million with an effective tax rate of 66.6 percent.  For the year ended October 31, 2018, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) as discussed below.For 2017, the company's income tax expense was $119 million with an effective tax rate of 14.8 percent. Our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. During the year, the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as indefinitely reinvested. As such, a deferred tax liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in the annual tax expense.  Our annual effective tax rate also included tax benefits due to the settlement of an audit in Germany for the years 2005 through 2008 and the lapse of U.S. statute of limitation for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013. This benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the U.S.For 2016, the company’s income tax expense was $82 million with an effective tax rate of 15.1 percent. The income tax provision for the year ended October 31, 2016 included net discrete tax expense of $17 million primarily due to tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on an equity method investment impairment that would generate a capital loss when realized.The company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. In December 2018, the tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027 see Note 19, "Subsequent Events" for more information. Other tax holidays are due for renewal between 2019 and 2020. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $87 million, $93 million, and $86 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.27, $0.29, and $0.26 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.2017 U.S. Tax Reform - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law.  The Tax Act enacted significant changes affecting our fiscal year 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and (2) imposing a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that had not been previously taxed in the U.S.The Tax Act also establishes new tax provisions affecting our fiscal year 2019, including, but not limited to, (1) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”); (2) generally eliminating U.S. federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”); (4) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”); (5) establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income ("FDII"); (6) repealing domestic production activity deduction; and (7) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation.37Table of Contents            The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. Due to our fiscal year end, the lower corporate tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of 23 percent for our fiscal year ending October 31, 2018 and 21 percent for subsequent fiscal years.ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment.  However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ("SAB 118") which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not extending beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date. For the year ended October  31, 2018, the company recognized income tax expense related to the Tax Act of $552 million which includes (1) an expense of $499 million of U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and (2) an expense of $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased U.S. corporate tax rate as described below.  As of October 31, 2018, the company has completed the accounting for all the impacts of the Tax Act except for the policy election for the treatment of the tax on GILTI inclusions. Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax ("Transition Tax"): The Transition Tax is based on the company’s total unrepatriated post-1986 earnings and profits ("E&P") of its foreign subsidiaries and the amount of non-U.S. taxes paid (Tax Pools) on such earnings. Historically, the company permanently reinvested a significant portion of these post-1986 E&P outside the U.S. For the remaining portion, the company previously accrued deferred taxes. Since the Tax Act required all foreign earnings to be taxed currently, the company recorded an income tax expense of $651 million for its one-time transition U.S. federal tax and a benefit of $152 million for the reversal of related deferred tax liabilities. The resulting $499 million net transition tax, reduced by existing tax credits, will be paid over 8 years in accordance with the election available under the Tax Act. We have completed our accounting for charges related to the Transition Tax.Reduction of U.S. Federal Corporate Tax Rate:  The reduction of the corporate income tax rate requires companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. The amount recorded for the year ended October31, 2018 for the remeasurement due to tax rate change is $53 million. We have completed our accounting for the measurement of deferred taxes. GILTI:  The Tax Act subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its GILTI. U.S. GAAP allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (1) treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in the U.S. taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred (“period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (“deferred method”).  Our analysis of the new GILTI rules and how they may impact us is incomplete. Accordingly, we have not made a policy election regarding the treatment of GILTI tax.Indefinite Reinvestment Assertion: Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the company had indefinite investment assertion on a significant portion of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, we have reevaluated our historic assertion and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.  The company repatriated $1,921 million of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018. The company has recorded a deferred tax liability of $11 million for foreign withholding taxes on repatriation of remaining undistributed earnings.In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2015 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. There were no substantial changes to the status of these open tax years during 2018. The U.S. statute of limitation for audit of tax returns for the fiscal years 2014 expired in July 2018.  The statute expiration resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $23 million. In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2001. With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate 38Table of Contents            of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.Segment OverviewIn 2018, we re-organized our operating segments and moved the microfluidics business from our life sciences and applied markets operating segment to our diagnostics and genomics operating segment.

Gross margin increased 1 percentage point in 2017 when compared to 2016, mainly driven out of higher volumes. Research and development expenses increased 22 percent in 2018 when compared to 2017. The increase was mainly due to additional expenses related to the acquisition of Lasergen, increase in wages and variable pay and unfavorable currency movements. Research and development expenses increased 2 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016.  The spending increase was related to an acquisition and higher wages and variable pay.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13 percent in 2018 when compared to 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increase was due to the additional expenses related to the acquisitions of Lasergen and AATI, increases in wages and variable pay and unfavorable currency movements. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses increase was related to additional operating expenses associated with an acquisition and higher wages and variable pay partially offset by reduced expenses due to business improvement initiatives.Operating margin decreased 1 percentage point in 2018 when compared to 2017.  The decline in operating margin was due additional expenses related to the acquisitions of Lasergen and AATI. Operating margin increased 3 percentage points in 2017 when compared to 2016.   The margin improvement was driven by higher revenue volumes partially offset by adding the cost structure of an acquisition and higher wages and variable pay.Income from OperationsIncome from operations in 2018 increased by $10 million or 6 percent when compared to 2017 on a revenue increase of $83 million.  The increase was due to higher volumes partially offset by higher expenses related to the acquisitions.  Income from operations in 2017 increased by $37 million or 28 percent when compared to 2016 on a revenue increase of $70 million.  The increase was due to higher volumes and controlled expenses.Agilent CrossLabThe Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive consumables and services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes.

Foreign currency movements for 2018 had an overall favorable impact of 2 percentage points when compared to 2017.  Revenue growth in 2018 was driven by the entire portfolio, including all consumables, all major service categories and remarketed instruments. Geographically, revenue increased 7 percent in the Americas with no currency impact, increased 12 percent in Europe with a 6 percentage point favorable currency impact and increased 15 percent in Asia Pacific with a 2 percentage point favorable currency impact. Agilent CrossLab business saw a broad based and sustained revenue growth in most key end markets throughout 2018, especially from the pharmaceutical and food markets.  Agilent CrossLab business revenue in 2017 increased 8 percent when compared to 2016. Revenue growth in 2017 was led by increases in most service categories and in the remarketed instruments business.Agilent CrossLab business saw positive revenue growth in all the key end markets in 2017, except in the forensics market.  In 2017, revenue growth, from a percentage perspective, was led by the food market.  The pharmaceutical and biotechnology market in 2017 saw slower growth than in 2016, but was still the primary growth driver from a volume perspective.  The chemical and energy market provided the same level of solid revenue growth in 2017 as it did in 2016.Looking forward, we anticipate that the balanced strength in nearly all key end markets will continue to drive the revenue growth in the near term.  The Agilent CrossLab portfolio of products and services are well positioned to succeed in both accelerating and decelerating market conditions in any of our key end markets.  Geographically, we remain optimistic on the market growth and market penetration opportunities in China and emerging markets.  Other factors for near term revenue growth include our recently completed acquisitions of Ultra Scientific and ProZyme, as well as investment in our laboratory enterprise offerings and in our continuing expansion of our e-commerce sales channel.Gross Margin and Operating MarginThe following table shows the Agilent CrossLab business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2018 versus 2017 and 2017 versus 2016. Years Ended October 31, 2018 over 2017Change 2017 over 2016Change 2018 2017 2016 Total gross margin50.7% 49.5% 49.4% 1 ppt —Operating margin23.3% 22.1% 22.3% 1 ppt —(in millions)         Research and development$55 $49 $46 12% 7%Selling, general and administrative$410 $370 $339 11% 9%Income from operations$397 $338 $316 17% 7%Gross margin for products and services increased 1 percentage points in 2018 when compared to 2017.  Gross margin increase came primarily from higher sales volume.  Gross margin was flat in 2017 when compared to 2016, due to the higher sales volume offset by higher wages and variable pay.Research and development expenses increased 12 percent in 2018 when compared to 2017.  Research and development increase was primarily due to higher wages across the various research organizations, and due to increased headcount in the areas of software development, iLab development and customer training curriculum development.  Research and development expenses increased 7 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016, due to increased investment related to an acquisition, as well as higher wages and variable pay.43Table of Contents            Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11 percent in 2018 when compared to 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to higher wages, higher variable pay, increased corporate infrastructure costs, and increased sales force investments.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016, due to higher orders driving higher selling costs, as well as higher wages and variable pay and the additional operating expenses from an acquisition.Operating margin increased 1 percentage point in 2018 when compared to 2017. The increase in operating margin was primarily due to higher sales volume.  Operating margin was flat in 2017 when compared to 2016, due to higher sales volume helping to offset growth in the number of service workforce, higher wages and variable pay and higher field selling costs.Income from OperationsIncome from operations in 2018 increased by $59 million or 17 percent when compared to 2017 on a revenue increase of $170 million.

Financial ConditionLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur financial position as of October 31, 2018 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2,247 million as compared to $2,678 million as of October 31, 2017.As of October 31, 2018, approximately $1,361 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries. In 2018, we repatriated $1,921 million of the cash held outside the U.S. The cash remaining outside the U.S. can be repatriated to the U.S. as local working capital and other regulatory conditions permit. As a result of the Tax Act, our cash and cash equivalents are no longer subjected to U.S. federal tax on repatriation into the U.S. We utilize a variety of funding strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.As a result of the Tax Act, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax of $426 million on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. federal income tax.  The transition tax is payable, beginning in fiscal year 2019 over eight years with 8 percent due in each of the first five years, 15 percent in year six, 20 percent in year seven and 25 percent in year eight.We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.Net Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,087 million in 2018 as compared to $889 million provided in 2017 and $793 million provided in 2016. We paid approximately $103 million under our variable and incentive pay programs, as compared to a total of $91 million paid during the same period of 2017. Net cash paid for income taxes was approximately $102 million in 2018, as compared to $63 million in 2017 and $67 million in 2016. For the year ended October 31, 2018, the net change in tax-related assets and liabilities of $552 million was due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act and primarily consisted of an estimated provision of $499 million of U.S. transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as well as an estimated $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased U.S. corporate income tax rate. For the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, other assets and liabilities used cash of $4 million, used cash of $98 million and provided cash of $10 million, respectively. The increase in cash usage for the year ended October 31, 2017 in other assets and liabilities is primarily due to pension contributions and taxes.In 2018, the change in accounts receivable used cash of $65 million, $81 million in 2017, and $33 million in 2016. Days' sales outstanding as of October 31, were 54 days in 2018, 55 days in 2017 and 51 days in 2016. The change in accounts payable provided cash of $40 million in 2018, provided cash of $2 million in 2017 and used cash of $15 million in 2016. Cash used in inventory was $83 million in 2018, in $61 million in 2017 and $7 million in 2016. Inventory days on-hand increased to 98 days in 2018 compared to 95 days in 2017 and increased compared to 92 days in 2016. We contributed zero, $25 million and zero to our U.S. defined benefit plans in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We 44Table of Contents            contributed $21 million, $21 million and $24 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We contributed less than $1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016 to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year.  Total contributions in 2018 were $21 million or 54 percent less than 2017.  Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We  do not expect to contribute to our U.S. plans and U.S. post-retirement benefit plans during 2019.  We expect to contribute $23 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans during 2019.        Net Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities in 2018 was $704 million and in 2017 was $305 million as compared to net cash used of $238 million in 2016. Investments in property, plant and equipment were $177 million in 2018, $176 million in 2017 and $139 million in 2016. In 2018 we invested $516 million in acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, net of cash acquired for the acquisition of seven businesses compared to the acquisition of two businesses for $128 million in 2017 and the acquisition of two businesses for $261 million in 2016.  In 2018 there were approximately $11 million purchases of cost method investments compared to $1 million outlay in 2017 and $80 million in 2016. Change in restricted cash and cash equivalents was $1 million inflow in 2018, $1 million outflow in 2017 and $245 million inflow in 2016, respectively (changes in 2016 related to our Seahorse Biosciences acquisition).Net Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities in 2018 was $797 million compared to $202 million in 2017 and $268 million in 2016, respectively. Treasury Stock Repurchases On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The program was designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares.  For the year ended October 31, 2016 we repurchased 2 million shares for $98 million which completed the purchases under this authorization. On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2015 repurchase program"). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  During the year ended October 31, 2016,  upon the completion of our previous repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares for $336 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares for $194 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2018 we repurchased and retired approximately 6.4 million shares for $422 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2018, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $188 million of our common stock under this program which expired on November 1, 2018.On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2019 repurchase program") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. Dividends For the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 cash dividends of $191 million, $170 million and $150 million were paid on the company's outstanding common stock, respectively. On November 14, 2018 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.164 per share of common stock, or approximately $52 million which will be paid on January 23, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2018. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.45Table of Contents            Credit FacilityOn September 15, 2014, Agilent entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution which provides for a $400 million five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on September 15, 2019. On June 9, 2015, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by $300 million and on July 14, 2017, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $1 billion. As of October 31, 2018, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the facility. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017. Short-term and Long-term DebtIn October 2007, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes ("2017 senior notes"). On October 20, 2014, we settled the redemption of $500 million of the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2017 senior notes.  The remaining $100 million in senior notes matured and were paid in full on November 1, 2017.In July 2010, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes ("2020 senior notes"). The 2020 senior notes were issued at 99.54% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on July 15, 2020, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year, payments commenced on January 15, 2011.On August 9, 2011, we terminated our interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million. The asset value, including interest receivable, upon termination for these contracts was approximately $34 million and the amount to be amortized at October 31, 2018 was $7 million. The gain is being deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2020 senior notes.In September 2012, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $400 million in senior notes ("2022 senior notes"). The 2022 senior notes were issued at 99.80% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on October 1, 2022, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.20% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on April 1st and October 1st of each year, payments commenced on April 1, 2013.In July 2012, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $400 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2022 senior notes issued on September 10, 2012. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 10, 2012 and we recognized a deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2022 senior notes. The remaining gain to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2018 was $1 million. In June 2013, the company issued aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes ("2023 senior notes"). The 2023 senior notes were issued at 99.544% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on July 15, 2023 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.875% per annum.

The interest is payable semi-annually on March 22nd  and September 22nd of each year and payments commenced March 22, 2017.  In February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes.The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2018 was $7 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and OtherWe have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. See Note 14, "Commitments and Contingencies", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases.Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many 46Table of Contents            locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.Contractual CommitmentsOur cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2018 for Agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): Less than oneyear One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsOperating leases$42 $58 $23 $57Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers412 2 — —Other purchase commitments80 — — —Retirement plans23 — — —Transitional pension contributions to our U.S. 401(k) plan$7 $15 $3 $—Total$564 $75 $26 $57Operating Leases.    Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property, see Note 14, "Commitments and Contingencies".Commitments to Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers.    We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. The above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.In addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers, in the past we recorded a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October 31, 2018, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was less than $1 million, $1 million as of October 31, 2017 and less than $1 million as of October 31, 2016. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Other Purchase Commitments.    We have categorized "other purchase commitments" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. Typically, we can cancel contracts without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, we are disclosing the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under "other purchase commitments" were approximately $80 million within the next year. Approximately $27 million of the new contracts relate to penalties that will reduce over the next 15 years.Retirement Plans.    Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. Contributions after next year are impractical to estimate. Effective May 1, 2016 until April 30, 2022, we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the U.S. Retirement Plan benefits being frozen.We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2018 or October 31, 2017.47Table of Contents            On Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table summarizes our total contractual obligations on our October 31, 2018 balance sheet (in millions): Less than oneyear One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsSenior notes$— $500 $1,000 $300Credit facility(1)— — — —Interest expense70 116 79 27Transition tax(2)34 68 68 256Total$104 $684 $1,147 $583(1)  The credit facility expires on September 15, 2019.(2)  The transition tax payable may be adjusted based on our 2018 tax return filings.Other long-term liabilities as of October 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017 include $607 million and $131 million, respectively, related to long-term income tax liabilities.  Of these amounts, $215 million and $131 million related to uncertain tax positions as of October 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement.  The remaining $392 million in other long-term liabilities relates to the one-time transition tax payable after fiscal year 2019. The transition tax is payable, beginning in fiscal year 2019 over eight years with 8 percent due in each of the first five years, 15 percent in year six, 20 percent in year seven and 25 percent in year eight. 48Table of Contents            Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction.Our operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 53 percent of our revenue in 2018, 51 percent of our revenue in 2017 and 54 percent of our revenues in 2016 were generated in U.S. dollars.The favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, principally as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, has increased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2018. We calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter to the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, statement of comprehensive income or cash flows.We are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. We believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk.  We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt. As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt.49Table of Contents            Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary DataIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements Page   Consolidated Financial Statements:  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 51Consolidated Statement of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2018 53Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2018 54Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2018 and 2017 55Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2018 56Consolidated Statement of Equity for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2018 57Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 58Quarterly Summary (unaudited) 10250Table of Contents            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Agilent Technologies, Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule appearing under Item 15(a)(2). (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.51Table of Contents            Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP   San Jose, California December 20, 2018   We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1999. 52Table of

Technologies, Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.Basis of Presentation.    The accompanying financial data has been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.Principles of Consolidation.    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.Revision of Services and Other, Product Net Revenue and related Cost of Sales.  In 2018, we identified a stream of service revenue that had been presented as product revenue in the prior years.  We have revised prior year's presentation to show the revenue within services and other to conform with the current presentation in fiscal 2018.   The cost of sales associated with these newly identified service revenue has also been revised to align with the new presentation. For the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 service and other revenue increased $13 million and $14 million, respectively, and service and other cost of sales increased $7 million in both periods, with corresponding reductions in product revenue and cost of sales.  These corrections to the classifications are not considered to be material to current or prior periods and had no impact to our results of operations previously reported in our consolidated statement of operations.Use of Estimates.    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions and accounting for income taxes.Retirement of Treasury Shares.  Upon the formal retirement of treasury shares, we deduct the par value of the retired treasury shares from common stock and allocate the excess of cost over par as a deduction to additional paid-in capital, based on the pro-rata portion of additional paid-in-capital, and the remaining excess as a deduction to retained earnings.  All retired treasury shares revert to the status of authorized but unissued shares.Revenue Recognition.    We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services.We recognize revenue, net of trade discounts and allowances, provided that (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer for products, or when the service has been provided. We consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments. At the time of the transaction, we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition. Provisions for discounts, warranties, returns, extended payment terms, and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded.Product Revenue.   Product revenue includes revenue generated from the sales of our analytical instrumentation, software and consumables.  Our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of analytical instrumentation. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors, is reduced for estimated returns when appropriate. For sales or arrangements that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete.58Table of Contents            Where software is licensed separately, revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and has been transferred to the customer or, in the case of electronic delivery of software, when the customer is given access to the licensed software programs. We also evaluate whether collection of the receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable and whether any other undelivered elements of the arrangement exist on which a portion of the total fee would be allocated based on vendor-specific objective evidence.Service Revenue.  Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer and software support including, Software as a Service (SaaS), consulting including companion diagnostics and training and education. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. For example, customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period, while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer. In addition, the four revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized.Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.  Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of measurement instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized upon delivery once title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Delivery of installation, start-up services and other services varies based on the complexity of the equipment, staffing levels in a geographic location and customer preferences, and can range from a few days to a few months. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules which require vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value to allocate revenue in a multiple element arrangement. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.We have evaluated the deliverables in our multiple-element arrangements and concluded that they are separate units of accounting if the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. We allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. We determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met.We use VSOE of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists. VSOE of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately. TPE of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. As our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors, it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish TPE. ESP represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. We determine ESP for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including, but not limited to customer type, geography, market conditions, competitive landscape, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by management. We may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future. As these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in ESP. The aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.For sales arrangements that include equipment lease along with other products or services, revenue is allocated to the different elements based on the Revenue Recognition for Multiple Element Arrangements.  Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a capital (sales-type) lease using lease classification guidance.Deferred Revenue.    Deferred revenue represents the amount that is allocated to undelivered elements in multiple element arrangements. We limit the revenue recognized to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or meeting other specified performance conditions.Accounts Receivable, net.    Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable 59Table of Contents            credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of October 31, 2018 and 2017 was not material. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of product returns.Shipping and Handling Costs.  Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented.Inventory.    Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.  In May 2018, we re-organized our operating segments and moved our microfluidics business from our life sciences and applied markets operating segment to our diagnostics and genomics operating segment. As a result, we reassigned approximately $45 million of goodwill from our life sciences and applied markets segment to our diagnostics and genomics segment using the relative fair value allocation approach.  Goodwill balances as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, have been recast to conform to this new presentation. In fiscal year 2018, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2018. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. In-process research and development ("IPR&D") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.Agilent's indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater 60Table of Contents            than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2018. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. During the year ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Based on triggering events in the year ended October 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment of $4 million due to the cancellation of certain IPR&D projects. Share-Based Compensation.    For the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies, Inc. Long-Term Performance Program ("LTPP") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting.  Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense for all share-based awards of $71 million in 2018, $61 million in 2017 and $60 million in 2016. See Note 3, "Share-based Compensation" for additional information.Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans.   Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution retirement plans.  Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees.   Assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and the expense for these plans are derived annually.   See Note 12, “Retirement plans and post-retirement pension plans” for additional information. Taxes on Income.    Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. See Note 4, "Income Taxes" for more information.Warranty.    Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product revenue. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note 13, "Guarantees".Advertising.    Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred and amounted to $41 million in 2018, $38 million in 2017 and $30 million in 2016.Research and Development.    Costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.Sales Taxes.    Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue.Net Income Per Share.    Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income - the numerator - by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding - the denominator - during the period excluding the dilutive effect of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income per share gives effect to all potential common shares outstanding during the period unless the effect is anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. See Note 5, "Net Income Per Share".Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments.  We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.As of October 31, 2018, approximately $1,361 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries. In 2018, we repatriated $1,921 million  of the cash held outside the U.S. The cash remaining outside the U.S. can be repatriated to the U.S. as local working capital and other regulatory conditions permit. As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), our cash and cash equivalents are no longer subjected to U.S. federal tax on repatriation into the U.S. Our cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of short term deposits held at major global financial institutions, institutional money market funds, and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our funds.61Table of Contents            We classify investments as short-term investments if their original maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less. Currently, we have no short-term investments.Variable Interest Entities. We make a determination upon entering into an arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”).  The company evaluates its investments in privately held companies on an ongoing basis. We account for these investments under either the equity or cost method, depending on the circumstances.  We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure. During 2016, we wrote down an equity method investment to its fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $18 million.  In addition, we recorded an impairment of $7 million of uncollectible loans related to this equity method investment.During the year ended October 31, 2016, Agilent made a preferred stock investment in Lasergen for $80 million.  This investment in Lasergen was accounted for under the cost method.  Agilent’s initial ownership stake was 48 percent and included an option to acquire the remaining shares until March 2018. During the year ended October 31, 2018, we exercised our option and acquired all of the remaining shares of Lasergen, Inc. that we did not already own for an additional cash consideration of approximately  $107 million. The fair value remeasurement of our previous investment immediately before the acquisition resulted in a net gain of $20 million and was recorded in other income.  Lasergen was previously considered a VIE. As of October 31, 2018, we have no VIE's.Investments. Cost method investments consist of non-marketable equity securities and are accounted for at historical cost. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company’s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of long-term equity investments is determined using quoted market prices for those securities when available. For those long-term equity investments accounted for under the cost or equity method, their carrying value approximates their estimated fair value. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company’s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid. There are no equity method investments as of October 31, 2018 or 2017 . The fair value of our senior notes, calculated from quoted prices which are primarily Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance fair value hierarchy is lower than the carrying value by approximately $15 million as of October 31, 2018 and exceeds the carrying value by approximately $58 million  as of October 31, 2017. The change in the fair value over carrying value in the year ended October 31, 2018 is primarily due to increased market interest rates.  The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. These inputs, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. See also Note 10, "Fair Value Measurements" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments.Concentration of Credit Risk.    Financial instruments that potentially subject Agilent to significant concentration of credit risk include money market fund investments, time deposits and demand deposit balances. These investments are categorized as cash and cash equivalents. In addition, Agilent has credit risk from derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities and accounts receivable. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. We have a comprehensive credit policy in place and credit exposure is monitored on an ongoing basis.  Credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount and we sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. Credit risk is mitigated through collateral such as letter of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like cash in advance. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of combined accounts receivable as of October 31, 2018, or 2017.Derivative Instruments.    Agilent is exposed to global foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts, primarily forward contracts and purchased options and, in the past, interest rate swaps to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest 62Table of Contents            rates. In the vast majority of cases, these contracts are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency or interest exposures. Foreign currency exposures include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. Interest rate exposures are associated with the company's fixed-rate debt. For option contracts, we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness. To qualify for hedge accounting, contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies; foreign exchange hedging contracts generally mature within twelve months and interest rate swaps, if any, mature at the same time as the maturity of the debt. In order to manage foreign currency exposures in a few limited jurisdictions we may enter into foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. In such circumstances, the local foreign currency exposure is offset by contracts owned by the parent company. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, changes in value of the derivative are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedges, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument is recognized in comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and changes in the fair values are recorded in the income statement in the current period. Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are disclosed gross in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was not material.  Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged or economically hedged item, primarily in operating activities.Property, Plant and Equipment.    Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over three to ten years. We use the straight-line method to depreciate assets.Leases.    We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under operating leases for original terms ranging generally from one year to twenty years. Certain leases contain renewal options for periods up to six years. In addition, we lease equipment to customers in connection with our diagnostics business using both capital and operating leases. As of October 31, 2018 and 2017 our diagnostics and genomics segment has approximately $32 million and $27 million, respectively, of lease receivables related to capital leases and approximately $20 million and $22 million, respectively, of net assets for operating leases.  We depreciate the assets related to the operating leases over their estimated useful lives, typically five years.Capitalized Software.    We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software. Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over three to five years once development is complete.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.    We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable.Employee Compensation and Benefits.    Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $107 million and $101 million as of October 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively.Foreign Currency Translation.    We translate and remeasure balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates at the balance sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates 63Table of Contents            which approximate to average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity.For those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for non-monetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income. Net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including hedging gains and losses, are reported in other income (expense), net and was $3 million loss for 2018, $2 million loss for 2017 and $5 million loss for 2016, respectively. 2.     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance, Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from contract with customers, which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The objective of the new revenue standard is to significantly enhance comparability and clarify principles of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. The guidance is effective for us at the beginning of our fiscal year 2019. We will adopt this standard on November 1, 2018 through application of the modified retrospective method reflecting the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance to revenue recognition in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Under the new guidance, there are specific criteria to determine if a performance obligation should be recognized over time or at a point in time. We expect that in some cases the revenue recognition timing under the new guidance will change from current practice.  We have substantially completed our analysis of the impact of the new guidance in 2018. While the timing of revenue recognition for some of the company’s sales transactions will be affected by the new guidance, the impact is not expected to be material. The cumulative impact to beginning retained earnings from adopting the new revenue standard is expected to be a credit of less than $30 million. In January 2016, the FASB issued amendments to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard requires entities to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The provisions under this amendment are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year. Early adoption is not permitted. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends the existing accounting standards for leases. Consistent with existing guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach. We are in the process of assessing the impact of the new guidance on our financial statements and consider that the most notable impact upon the adoption of the new standard will be the recognition of a material right-of-use asset and lease liability for our real estate and automobile leases.In August 2016, the FASB issued amendments to address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  We do not expect the impact of the amendments to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows and disclosures.In October 2016, the FASB issued amendments to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year. There is no material impact expected to our cumulative retained earnings on adoption of these amendments.  In November 2016, the FASB issued amendments to require amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.  The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  We do not expect the impact of the amendments to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows and disclosures.  In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance intended to clarify the definition of a business in connection with business combinations with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted 64Table of Contents            for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.  This guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  Adjustments will be recorded in the period that they are determined rather than applied retrospectively via revision to the period of acquisition and each period thereafter.   We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In January 2017, the FASB issued an amendment to modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The amendment also simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2020.  Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  We do not expect to early adopt nor do we expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. This guidance also specifies that only the service cost component of net benefit cost is eligible for capitalization. The standard requires employers to report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs and to report the other components of net periodic benefit costs (which include interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost or credits and actuarial gains and losses) separately and below operating income in the statement of operations. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods.  We expect the adoption of this guidance to result in an impact of approximately $20 million of income reclassified from our income from operations to other income (expense) on our consolidated statement of operations in fiscal year 2019. In future filings, we will revise our prior periods to conform to the new presentation required under this guidance.In May 2017, the FASB issued an update to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In August 2017, the FASB issued amendments to hedge accounting intended to better align a company's risk management strategies and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and presentation of hedge results.  The amendments expand and refine accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and align the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and hedged item in the financial statements.   The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2019, including the interim periods within those annual periods.  We expect to early adopt this guidance beginning November 1, 2018.  We do not expect the the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In February 2018, the FASB issued amendments to reporting comprehensive income to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted in December 2017 that reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and made other changes to U.S. federal tax laws.  The amendments in this update also require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects.   The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2019, and for interim periods within that fiscal year and should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized. We expect to adopt this guidance on November 1, 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures upon adoption.In February 2018, the FASB issued technical corrections and improvements to amendments published in January 2016 to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The provisions under these corrections and improvements are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year. Early adoption is not permitted. We currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.65Table of Contents            In August 2018, the FASB issued updates to improve the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement which eliminates certain disclosure requirements and modifies others. These amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2020, and for interim periods within that year with early adoption permitted. We currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In August 2018, the FASB issued updates to improve the effectiveness of disclosures for defined benefit plans under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 715-20. The amendments in this guidance remove disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosures, and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. These amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.Other amendments to GAAP in the U.S. that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.3.     SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONAgilent accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our ESPP and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the LTPP based on estimated fair values. Description of Share-Based PlansEmployee Stock Purchase Plan.    Effective November 1, 2000, we adopted the ESPP. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to ten percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the closing market price at purchase date. Currently, there are 75 million shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP.Under our ESPP, employees purchased 558,116 shares for $32 million in 2018, 618,270 shares for $26 million in 2017 and 696,178 shares for $23 million in 2016. As of October 31, 2018, the number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under our ESPP was 26,937,115. This excludes the number of shares of common stock to be issued to participants in consideration of the aggregate participants contributions totaling $17 million as of October 31, 2018.Incentive Compensation Plans.    On November 15, 2017 and March 21, 2018, the Board of Directors and the stockholders, respectively, approved the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2018 Stock Plan (the "2018 Plan") which amends, including renaming and extending the term of, the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (the "2009 Plan").  The 2009 plan replaced the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Plan and 1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan. The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions on vesting or exercisability, and cash awards. The 2018 Plan has a term of ten years. As of October 31, 2018, 6,158,260 shares were available for future awards under the 2018 Stock Plan.Stock options under the 2018 Stock Plan may be either "incentive stock options", as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options were granted prior to November 1, 2015 and generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant with a maximum contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted. Agilent issues new shares of common stock when employee stock options are exercised. Effective November 1, 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the LTPP, which is a performance stock award program administered under the 2018 Stock Plan, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets are met. Certain LTPP awards are generally designed to meet the criteria of a performance award with the performance metrics and peer group comparison based on the Total Stockholders’ Return (“TSR”) set at the beginning of the performance period. Effective November 1, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved another type of performance stock award, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are also entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets over the three-year period are met.   The performance target for grants made in 2016  were based on Operating 66Table of Contents            Margin (“OM”) and the performance grants made in 2017 and 2018 were based on Earnings Per Share ("EPS"). In the case of LTPP-OM, the performance targets for all the three years of performance period are set at the time of grant. The performance targets for LTPP-EPS grants for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period are set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3, respectively. All LTPP awards granted after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period.Based on the performance metrics the final LTPP award may vary from zero to 200 percent of the target award. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP program is three years and the maximum award value for awards granted in 2017 and 2016 cannot exceed 300 percent of the grant date target value. We consider the dilutive impact of these programs in our diluted net income per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are expected to be met.We also issue restricted stock units under our share-based plans. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Stock Plans is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. Restricted stock units generally vest, with some exceptions, at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant. All restricted stock units granted to our executives after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period.Impact of Share-based Compensation AwardsWe have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method under the authoritative guidance. For all share-based awards we have recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As the guidance requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.The impact on our results for share-based compensation was as follows: Years Ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Cost of products and services$16 $15 $14Research and development7 6 6Selling, general and administrative48 40 40Total share-based compensation expense$71 $61 $60At October 31, 2018 and 2017 there was no share-based compensation capitalized within inventory. Valuation AssumptionsFor all periods presented, shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date.The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards, LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) was determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield and as appropriate, a discount related to the one-year post vesting. The compensation cost for LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) awards reflect the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period.The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of awards granted. Years Ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016LTPP:     Volatility of Agilent shares21% 23% 24%Volatility of selected peer-company shares14%-66% 15%-63% 14%-50%Pair-wise correlation with selected peers32% 36% 35%      Post-vest restriction discount for all executive awards4.8% 5.3% 5.5%67Table of Contents            Shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulations model. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. For the LTPP (TSR) grants in 2016, we used the 3-year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies and an expected dividend yield to compute the discount. We believed our historical volatility prior to the separation of Keysight in 2015 was no longer relevant to use. For LTPP (TSR) grants in 2017 and thereafter, we used our own historical stock price volatility.           All LTPP awards granted to our executives have a one-year post-vest holding restriction. The estimated discount associated with post-vest holding restrictions is calculated using the Finnerty model. The model calculates the potential lost value if the employee were able to sell the shares during the lack of marketability period, instead of being required to hold the shares.

For the year ended October 31, 2018, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) as discussed below.For 2017, the company's income tax expense was $119 million with an effective tax rate of 14.8 percent. Our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. During the year, the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as indefinitely reinvested. As such, a deferred tax liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in the annual tax expense.  Our annual effective tax rate also included tax benefits due to the settlement of an audit in Germany for the years 2005 through 2008 and the lapse of U.S. statute of limitation for the fiscal years 2012 and 70Table of Contents            2013. This benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the U.S.For 2016, the company’s income tax expense was $82 million with an effective tax rate of 15.1 percent. The income tax provision for the year ended October 31, 2016 included net discrete tax expense of $17 million primarily due to tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on an equity method impairment that would generate a capital loss when realized.The company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. In December 2018, the tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027, see Note 19, "Subsequent Events" for more information. Other tax holidays are due for renewal 2019 and 2020. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $87 million, $93 million, and $86 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.27, $0.29, and $0.26 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.2017 U.S. Tax Reform - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law.  The Tax Act enacted significant changes affecting our fiscal year 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and (2) imposing a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that had not been previously taxed in the U.S.The Tax Act also establishes new tax provisions affecting our fiscal year 2019, including, but not limited to, (1) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”); (2) generally eliminating U.S. federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”); (4) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”); (5) establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income ("FDII"); (6) repealing domestic production activity deduction; and (7) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation.The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. Due to our fiscal year end, the lower corporate tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of 23 percent for our fiscal year ending October 31, 2018 and 21 percent for subsequent fiscal years.ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment.  However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ("SAB 118") which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not extending beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date. For the year ended October 31, 2018, the company recognized  income tax expense related to the Tax Act of $552 million which includes (1) an expense of $499 million of U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and (2) an expense of $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased U.S. corporate tax rate as described below.  As of October 31, 2018, the company has completed the accounting for all the impacts of the Tax Act except for the policy election for the treatment of the tax on GILTI inclusions. Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax ("Transition Tax"): The Transition Tax is based on the company’s total unrepatriated post-1986 earnings and profits ("E&P") of its foreign subsidiaries and the amount of non-U.S. taxes paid (Tax Pools) on such earnings. Historically, the company permanently reinvested a significant portion of these post-1986 E&P outside the U.S. For the remaining portion, the company previously accrued deferred taxes. Since the Tax Act required all foreign earnings to be taxed currently, the company recorded an income tax expense of $651 million for its one-time transition U.S. federal tax and a benefit of $152 million for the reversal of related deferred tax liabilities. The resulting $499 million net transition tax, reduced by existing tax credits, will be paid over 8 years in accordance with the election available under the Tax Act. We have completed our accounting for charges related to the Transition Tax.Reduction of U.S. Federal Corporate Tax Rate:  The reduction of the corporate income tax rate requires companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. The amount recorded for the year ended October31, 2018 for the remeasurement due to tax rate change is $53 million. We have completed our accounting for the measurement of deferred taxes. GILTI:  The Tax Act subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its GILTI.  U.S. GAAP allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (1) treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in the U.S. taxable income as a current-period expense 71Table of Contents            when incurred (“period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (“deferred method”).  Our analysis of the new GILTI rules and how they may impact us is incomplete. Accordingly, we have not made a policy election regarding the treatment of GILTI tax.Indefinite Reinvestment Assertion: Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the company had indefinite investment assertion on a significant portion of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, we have reevaluated our historic assertion and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.  The company repatriated $1,921 million of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018. The company has recorded a deferred tax liability of $11 million for foreign withholding taxes on repatriation of remaining undistributed earnings.The significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are: October 31, 2018 2017 DeferredTax Assets Deferred TaxLiabilities DeferredTax Assets Deferred TaxLiabilities (in millions)Inventory$7 $— $16 $—Intangibles— 112 — 93Property, plant and equipment8 — 12 —Warranty reserves8 — 12 —Pension benefits and retiree medical benefits49 — 70 —Employee benefits, other than retirement34 — 28 —Net operating loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards185 — 328 —Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries— 18 — 163Share-based compensation31 — 45 —Deferred revenue38 — 45 —Other4 3 1 —Subtotal364 133 557 256Tax valuation allowance(135) — (138) —Total deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities$229 $133 $419 $256The decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 for the deferred tax asset and liabilities was primarily due to the Tax Act. Valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. As of October 31, 2018, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of $135 million until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal. The valuation allowance is mainly related to deferred tax assets for California R&D credits, net operating losses in the state of Colorado and the Netherlands and capital losses in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.At October 31, 2018, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $21 million, $671 million and $330 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019. If not utilized, $140 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019. The remaining $190 million of the foreign net operating losses carry forward indefinitely. At October 31, 2018, we had federal and foreign capital loss carryforwards of $48 million and $119 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal capital loss carryforwards will expire in 2022. The foreign capital losses carry forward indefinitely. At October 31, 2018, we had state tax credit carryforwards, net of reserves of approximately $41 million. The state tax credits carry forward indefinitely. 72Table of Contents            The breakdown between long-term deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities was as follows: October 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Long-term deferred tax assets (included within other assets)$165 $240Long-term deferred tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities)(69) (77)Total$96 $163The breakdown between current and long-term income tax assets and liabilities, excluding deferred tax assets and liabilities, was as follows: October 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Current income tax assets (included within other current assets)$59 $77Long-term income tax assets (included within other assets)19 18Current income tax liabilities (included within other accrued liabilities)(71) (55)Long-term income tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities)(607) (131)Total$(600) $(91)The aggregate changes in the balances of our unrecognized tax benefits including all federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions are as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Balance, beginning of year$224 $293 $289Additions for tax positions related to the current year27 32 31Additions for tax positions from prior years2 1 1Reductions for tax positions from prior years(13) (3) (27)Settlements with taxing authorities— (52) —Statute of limitations expirations(26) (47) (1)Balance, end of year$214 $224 $293As of October 31, 2018, we had $214 million of unrecognized tax benefits of which $190 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We recognized a tax expense of $11 million, a tax benefit of $9 million and a tax expense of $2 million of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of October 31, 2018 and 2017 were $27 million and $16 million, respectively.In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2015 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. There were no substantial changes to the status of these open tax years during 2018. The U.S. statute of limitation for audit of tax returns for fiscal year 2014 expired in July 2018.  The statute expiration resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $23 million. In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2001. With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.73Table of Contents            5.     NET INCOME PER SHAREThe following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented below.  Years Ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Numerator:     Net income$316 $684 $462Denominators:     Basic weighted average shares321 322 $326Potential common shares — stock options and other employee stock plans4 4 3Diluted weighted average shares325 326 329The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense collectively are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. An increase in the fair market value of the company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive awards. We exclude stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of our common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, we exclude from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, stock options, ESPP, LTPP and restricted stock awards whose combined exercise price and unamortized fair value collectively were greater than the average market price of our common stock because their effect would also be anti-dilutive.In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we issued approximately 2 million, 3 million and 3 million, of share-based awards, respectively.  For the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, options to purchase 36,200 shares, 200 shares and 1.1 million shares, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.6.     INVENTORY October 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Finished goods$386 $363Purchased parts and fabricated assemblies252 212Inventory$638 $575Inventory-related excess and obsolescence charges, included in continuing operations, of $26 million were recorded in total cost of products in 2018, $24 million in 2017 and $20 million in 2016, respectively.

As a result, we reassigned approximately $45 million of goodwill from our life sciences and applied markets segment to our diagnostics and genomics segment using the relative fair value allocation approach.  Goodwill balances as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, have been recast to conform to this new presentation.As of September 30, 2018, we assessed goodwill impairment for our reporting units and no impairment was indicated.75Table of Contents            The component parts of other intangible assets at October 31, 2018 and 2017 are shown in the table below: Other Intangible Assets GrossCarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortizationand Impairments Net BookValue (in millions)As of October 31, 2017:     Purchased technology$855 $646 $209Trademark/Tradename149 73 76Customer relationships151 112 39Third-party technology and licenses$27 $14 $13Total amortizable intangible assets$1,182 $845 $337In-Process R&D24 — 24Total$1,206 $845 $361As of October 31, 2018:     Purchased technology$947 $683 $264Trademark/Tradename151 88 63Customer relationships107 63 44Third-party technology and licenses$28 $19 $9Total amortizable intangible assets$1,233 $853 $380In-Process R&D111 — 111Total$1,344 $853 $491      In 2018, we acquired seven businesses, for a combined purchase price of approximately $536 million. The largest of which was Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc. ("AATI") for approximately $268 million in cash.  The financial results of all these businesses have been included in our financial results from the date of the business’ respective close. We have not included the pro forma impact of these acquisitions since they are not material individually or in aggregate to our current or prior period results. During  2018, we recorded additions to goodwill of $381 million and to other intangible assets of $262 million related to the acquisition of these businesses. During 2018, other intangible assets, net decreased $1 million, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation. During 2017, we recorded additions to goodwill of $78 million and to intangible assets of $52 million related to the acquisition of  two businesses. During the year other intangible assets decreased $5 million, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation. During 2018, we also wrote-off the gross carrying amount of $89 million and the related accumulated amortization of fully amortized intangible assets which were no longer being used.In general, for United States federal tax purposes, goodwill from asset purchases is deductible, however any goodwill created as part of a stock acquisition is not deductible.During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable.  In 2017, there were no impairments of other intangible assets recorded.  In 2016, we recorded impairments of other intangibles related to the cancellation of in-process research and development projects of $4 million.Amortization expense of intangible assets was $110 million in 2018, $120 million in 2017, and $154 million in 2016. 76Table of Contents            Future amortization expense related to existing finite-lived purchased intangible assets associated with business combinations for the next five fiscal years and thereafter is estimated below:Estimated future amortization expense:  (in millions)2019$942020$792021$652022$512023$41Thereafter$509.   INVESTMENTSThe following table summarizes the company's equity investments as of October 31, 2018 and 2017 (net book value): October 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Long-Term   Cost method investments$38 $106Trading securities30 32Total$68 $138During 2018, we acquired all of the remaining shares of Lasergen, Inc. (Lasergen), for an additional cash consideration of approximately $107 million, an investment that was accounted for under the cost method in 2017 for approximately $80 million. The fair value remeasurement of our previous investment immediately before the acquisition resulted in a net gain of $20 million and was recorded in other income. Cost method investments consist of non-marketable equity securities and a fund and are accounted for at historical cost. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. All of our investments, excluding trading securities, are subject to periodic impairment review. The impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. During the year ended October 31, 2016, we identified certain events and circumstances that indicated the decline in value of an equity method investment was other-than-temporary.  As a result, we wrote down the investment to its fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of approximately $18 million.Amounts included in other income (expense), net for the appropriate share of loss on equity method investments and other than temporary impairments were as follows: Years Ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Equity method investments - share of losses$— $— $(10)Equity method investments - other than temporary impairments — — (18)Total$— $— $(28)Net unrealized gains on our trading securities portfolio were $1 million in 2018, $4 million in 2017 and $1 million in 2016.10.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value 77Table of Contents            measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.Fair Value HierarchyThe guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:Level 1 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets; or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.Level 3 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2018 were as follows:   Fair Value Measurement                                                                 at October 31, 2018 Using October 31, 2018 Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) (in millions)Assets:       Short-term       Cash equivalents (money market funds)$1,355 $1,355 $— $—Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)16 — 16 —Long-term       Trading securities30 30 — —Total assets measured at fair value$1,401 $1,385 $16 $—Liabilities:       Short-term       Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)$5 $— $5 $—Long-term       Deferred compensation liability30 — 30 —Total liabilities measured at fair value$35 $— $35 $—78Table of Contents            Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2017 were as follows:   Fair Value Measurement                                                                    at October 31, 2017 Using October 31, 2017 Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) (in millions)Assets:       Short-term       Cash equivalents (money market funds)$1,659 $1,659 $— $—Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)4 — 4 —Long-term       Trading securities32 32 — —Total assets measured at fair value$1,695 $1,691 $4 $—Liabilities:      Short-term       Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)$6 $— $6 $—Long-term       Deferred compensation liability32 — 32 —Total liabilities measured at fair value$38 $— $38 $—Our money market funds and trading securities are generally valued using quoted market prices and therefore are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative financial instruments are classified within level 2, as there is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets. Our deferred compensation liability is classified as level 2 because although the values are not directly based on quoted market prices, the inputs used in the calculations are observable.Trading securities, which is comprised of mutual funds, bonds and other similar instruments, and deferred compensation liability are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Certain derivative instruments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from the sale of these instruments are recorded in net income.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring BasisLong-Lived AssetsFor assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, the following table summarizes the impairments included in net income for the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: Years EndedOctober 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Long-lived assets held and used$21 $— $4Long-lived assets held for sale$— $— $—For 2018,  long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of $21 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $21 million, which was included in net income. The impairment charge in 2018 of  $21 million relates to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment  that were deemed unrecoverable. For 2017, there were no impairments of long-lived assets held and used. For 2016, long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of $4 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $4 million, which was 79Table of Contents            included in net income.  The impairment charge in 2016 of $4 million relates to IPR&D projects that were abandoned and written down to their fair value of zero. There were no impairments of long-lived assets held for sale in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Fair values for the impaired long-lived assets during 2018 and 2016 were measured using level 3 and 2 inputs respectively. To determine the fair value of long-lived assets in 2018, we used the income approach based on projected discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets over the remaining useful life.11.   DERIVATIVESWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of our business. As part of our risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, purchased options, and interest rate swaps, to hedge economic and/or accounting exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.Fair Value HedgesWe are exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. The fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and, in the past, we have used interest rate swaps to change our fixed interest rate payments to U.S. dollar LIBOR-based variable interest expense to match the floating interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and other short term investments. As of October 31, 2018, all interest rate swap contracts had either been terminated or had expired. On August 9, 2011, we terminated five interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million. The remaining gain to be amortized at October 31, 2018 was $7 million. All deferred gains from terminated interest rate swaps are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective senior notes.  Cash Flow HedgesWe enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities between one and twelve months. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance and are assessed for effectiveness against the underlying exposure every reporting period. Changes in the time value of the foreign exchange contract are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in other income (expense) each period. The changes in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations when the forecasted transaction occurs. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge relationship will be de-designated and amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to other income (expense) in the current period. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period. We record the premium paid (time value) of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in other income (expense) over the life of the option contract.  For the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, ineffectiveness and gains and losses recognized in other income (expense) due to de-designation of cash flow hedge contracts were not significant. In July 2012, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $400 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2022 senior notes issued on September 10, 2012.  We designated the treasury lock as a cash flow hedge. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 10, 2012 and we recognized a deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2022 senior notes. The remaining gain to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2018 was $1 million. In February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. These derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the 80Table of Contents            authoritative guidance. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2018 was $7 million. Other HedgesAdditionally, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in value of the derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations, in the current period, along with the offsetting foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities.Our use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions which are selected based on their credit ratings and other factors. We have established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk that include establishing counterparty credit limits, monitoring credit exposures, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties.A number of our derivative agreements contain threshold limits to the net liability position with counterparties and are dependent on our corporate credit rating determined by the major credit rating agencies. The counterparties to the derivative instruments may request collateralization, in accordance with derivative agreements, on derivative instruments in net liability positions.The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of October 31, 2018, was not material. The credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had not been triggered as of October 31, 2018.There were 158 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of October 31, 2018 and designated as cash flow hedges. There were 171 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of October 31, 2018 not designated as hedging instruments. The aggregated notional amounts by currency and designation as of October 31, 2018 were as follows:  Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges DerivativesNotDesignatedas HedgingInstruments  ForwardContracts USD ForwardContracts USDCurrency Buy/(Sell) Buy/(Sell)  (in millions)Euro $(44) $37British Pound (54) 16Canadian Dollar (39) 13Australian Dollars 4 1Malaysian Ringgit — (2)Japanese Yen (91) 14Danish Krone — 25Korean Won (34) (31)Singapore Dollar 14 6Swiss Franc — (9)Chinese Yuan Renminbi (38) (25)Polish Zloty — (5)Swedish Krona — (9)Other — (14)  $(282) $1781Table of Contents             Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are disclosed gross in the balance sheet in accordance with the authoritative guidance.

Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees.Agilent provides U.S. employees, who meet eligibility criteria under the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Retirement Plan (the "RP"), defined benefits which are based on an employee's base or target pay during the years of employment and on length of service. For eligible service through October 31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plans is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under the Agilent defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (the "DPSP"), which was closed to new participants as of November 1993. Effective November 1, 2014, Agilent’s U.S. defined benefit retirement plan is closed to new entrants including new employees, new transfers to the U.S. payroll and rehires. As of April 30, 2016, benefits under the RP were frozen.  See Plan Amendments below.82Table of Contents            As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of plan assets of the DPSP was $141 million and $156 million, respectively. Note that the projected benefit obligation for the DPSP equals the fair value of plan assets.In addition to the DPSP, in the U.S., Agilent maintains a Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan ("SBRP"), supplemental unfunded non-qualified defined benefit plan to provide benefits that would be provided under the RP but for limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The RP and the SBRP comprise the "U.S. Plans" in the tables below.Eligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and/or employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements.401(k) Defined Contribution Plan.    Eligible Agilent U.S. employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Plan.  Effective April 30, 2016, we began matching contributions to employees up to a maximum of 6 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation.  Effective May 1, 2016 until April 30, 2022, we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the RP benefits being frozen.  The maximum contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation, subject to regulatory limitations. The 401(k) Plan employer expense included in income from operations was $37 million in 2018, $33 million in 2017 and $24 million in 2016.Post-Retirement Medical Benefit Plans.    In addition to receiving retirement benefits, Agilent U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements as of their termination date may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Health Plan for Retirees. Eligible retirees who were less than age 50 as of January 1, 2005 and who retire after age 55 with 15 or more years of service are eligible for a fixed amount which can be utilized to pay for either sponsored plans and/or individual medicare plans. Effective January 1, 2012, employees who were at least age 50 as of January 1, 2005 and who retire after age 55 with 15 or more years of service are eligible for fixed dollar subsidies and stipends. Grandfathered retirees receive a fixed monthly subsidy toward pre-65 premium costs (subsidy capped at 2011 levels) and a fixed monthly stipend post-65. The subsidy amounts will not increase. In addition, any new employee hired on or after November 1, 2014, will not be eligible to participate in the retiree medical plans upon retiring.  As of April 30, 2016, benefits under this plan were changed - see Plan Amendments below.Plan Amendments. In 2016, we made changes to our U.S. Retirement Plan and Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan ("U.S. Plans").  Effective April 30, 2016, benefit accruals under the U.S. Plans were frozen.  Any pension benefit earned in the U.S. Plans through April 30, 2016 remained fully vested, and there were no additional benefit accruals after April 30, 2016.  In addition, active employees who have not met the eligibility requirement for the Retiree Medical Account (RMA) under the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan - 55 years old with at least 15 years of Agilent service - as of April 30, 2016 - will only be eligible for 50 percent of the current RMA reimbursement amount upon retirement.Due to these plan amendments, we recorded a curtailment gain of $15 million in the U.S. Plans during the year ended October 31, 2016. In addition, we recognized a settlement gain of $1 million related to the U.S. Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan during the year ended October 31, 2016.Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law. In Japan, Agilent has employees' pension fund plans, which are defined benefit pension plans established under the Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law (JWPIL). The plans are composed of (a) a substitutional portion based on the pay-related part of the old-age pension benefits prescribed by JWPIL (similar to social security benefits in the United States) and (b) a corporate portion based on a contributory defined benefit pension arrangement established at the discretion of the company. During the year ended October 31, 2017, Agilent received government approval and returned the substitutional portion of Japan's pension plan to the Japanese government, as allowed by the JWPIL. The initial transfer resulted in a net gain of $32 million recorded within cost of sales and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The net gain consisted of two parts - a gain of $41 million, representing the difference between the fair values of the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) settled of $65 million and the assets transferred from the pension trust to the government of Japan of $24 million, offset by a settlement loss of $9 million related to the recognition of previously unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, after the Japanese government’s final review of our initial payment, we received a refund of  $5 million which was recorded as a settlement gain.83Table of Contents            Components of Net periodic cost.    The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. For the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income were comprised of:  Pensions U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans                    2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Net periodic benefit cost (benefit)                 Service cost — benefits earned during the period$— $— $12 $20 $19 $19 $1 $1 $1Interest cost on benefit obligation16 15 16 13 12 16 3 3 4Expected return on plan assets(28) (25) (25) (46) (41) (44) (7) (7) (7)Amortization of net actuarial loss1 3 3 29 36 27 8 11 10Amortization of prior service benefit— — (3) — — — (8) (9) (10)Total periodic benefit cost (benefit)$(11) $(7) $3 $16 $26 $18 $(3) $(1) $(2)Curtailments and settlements$— $— $(16) $(5) $(32) $— $— $— $—Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss                 Net actuarial (gain) loss$2 $(19) $22 $49 $(128) $149 $(2) $(9) $3Amortization of net actuarial loss(1) (3) (3) (29) (36) (27) (8) (11) (10)Prior service cost (benefit)— — 15 — — — — — (7)Amortization of prior service benefit— — 3 — — — 8 9 10Gain due to settlement— — — — 32 — — — —Foreign currency— — — 1 2 (3) — — —Total recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss$1 $(22) $37 $21 $(130) $119 $(2) $(11) $(4)Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and other comprehensive (income) loss$(10) $(29) $24 $32 $(136) $137 $(5) $(12) $(6)84Table of Contents            Funded Status.    As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, the funded status of the defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans was: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S.Post-RetirementBenefit Plans 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in millions)Change in fair value of plan assets:           Fair value — beginning of year$414 $341 $855 $774 $95 $88Actual return on plan assets8 66 (9) 81 1 14Employer contributions— 25 21 21 — —Participants' contributions— — — — — —Benefits paid(21) (18) (26) (23) (6) (7)Settlements— — 5 (26) — —Currency impact— — (21) 28 — —Fair value — end of year$401 $414 $825 $855 $90 $95Change in benefit obligation:           Benefit obligation — beginning of year$445 $434 $935 $1,002 $97 $103Service cost— — 20 19 1 1Interest cost16 15 13 12 3 3Participants' contributions— — — — — —Plan amendment— — 1 (1) — —Actuarial (gain) loss(19) 15 (6) (43) (7) (3)Benefits paid(22) (19) (27) (22) (7) (7)Curtailments— — — — — —Settlements— — — (70) — —Currency impact— — (23) 38 — —Benefit obligation — end of year$420 $445 $913 $935 $87 $97Overfunded (underfunded) status of PBO$(19) $(31) $(88) $(80) $3 $(2)Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of:           Other assets$— $— $95 $86 $3 $—Employee compensation and benefits(1) (1) — — — —Retirement and post-retirement benefits(18) (30) (183) (166) — (2)Total net asset (liability)$(19) $(31) $(88) $(80) $3 $(2)Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss):           Actuarial (gains) losses$65 $65 $263 $243 $10 $20Prior service costs (benefits)— — — (1) (20) (28)Total$65 $65 $263 $242 $(10) $(8)The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized by Agilent as components of net expense during 2019 are as follows: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S. Post-RetirementBenefit Plans (in millions)Amortization of net prior service cost (benefit)$— $— $(8)Amortization of actuarial net loss (gain)$1 $35 $485Table of Contents            Investment Policies and Strategies as of October 31, 2018 and 2017. In the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans are approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments. Our DPSP target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 3 percent of our U.S. equity portfolio consists of limited partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation is from 31 to 60 percent to equities, from 38 to 61 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 25 percent to real estate investments and from zero to 12 percent to cash, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2018 and 2017 differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.Equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. Portions of the cash and cash equivalent, equity, and fixed income investments are held in commingled funds that are valued using Net Asset Value (“NAV”) as the practical expedient.   In addition, some of the investments valued using NAV as the practical expedient may have limits on their redemption to weekly or monthly and/or may require prior written notice specified by each fund.Fair Value.    The measurement of the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets uses the valuation methodologies and the inputs as described in Note 10, "Fair Value Measurements".Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term investment funds. The funds also invest in short-term domestic fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and quality. Some of our cash and cash equivalents are held in commingled funds. Other cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 investments.Equity - Some equity securities consisting of common and preferred stock that are not traded on an active market are valued at quoted prices reported by investment dealers based on the underlying terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments.Fixed Income - Some of the fixed income securities are not actively traded and are valued at quoted prices based on the terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments.Other Investments - Other investments also includes partnership investments where, due to their private nature, pricing inputs are not readily observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These valuations are based on proprietary appraisals, application of public market multiples to private company cash flows, utilization of market transactions that provide valuation information for comparable companies and other methods. Holdings of limited partnerships are classified as Level 3.Agilent has adopted the accounting guidance related to the presentation of certain investments using the NAV practical expedient. The accounting guidance exempts investments using this practical expedient from categorization within the fair value hierarchy. 86Table of Contents            The following tables present the fair

fiscal year 2019, we  do not expect to contribute to the U.S. defined benefit plans and the  Post-Retirement Medical Plans.  We expect to contribute $23 million to plans outside the U.S.  The following table presents expected future benefit payments for the next 10 years: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S. Post-RetirementBenefit Plans (in millions)2019$29 $23 $82020$31 $25 $82021$30 $28 $82022$29 $31 $72023$30 $33 $72024 - 2028$142 $175 $33Assumptions.    The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense for our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the tables below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans - October 31. The U.S. discount rates at October 31, 2018 and 2017, were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The non-U.S. rates were generally 90Table of Contents            based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. The range of assumptions that were used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries.Assumptions used to calculate the net periodic cost in each year were as follows: For years ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016U.S. defined benefit plans:     Discount rate3.75% 3.75% 4.20%Average increase in compensation levelsn/a n/a 3.50%Expected long-term return on assets7.00% 7.25% 7.50%Non-U.S. defined benefit plans:     Discount rate0.67-2.52% 0.22-2.66% 0.77-3.76%Average increase in compensation levels2.00-3.25% 2.00-4.25% 2.25-4.00%Expected long-term return on assets4.00-6.00% 4.00-6.25% 4.25-6.50%U.S. post-retirement benefits plans:     Discount rate3.50% 3.50% 4.00%Expected long-term return on assets7.00% 7.25% 7.50%Current medical cost trend rate6.00% 6.00% 7.00%Ultimate medical cost trend rate3.50% 3.50% 3.50%Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year2029 2029 2029Assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligation were as follows: As of the Years Ending October 31, 2018 2017U.S. defined benefit plans:   Discount rate4.50% 3.75%Non-U.S. defined benefit plans:   Discount rate0.83-2.68% 0.67-2.52%Average increase in compensation levels2.25-3.25% 2.00-3.25%U.S. post-retirement benefits plans:   Discount rate4.25% 3.50%Current medical cost trend rate6.00% 6.00%Ultimate medical cost trend rate3.50% 3.50%Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year2029 2029Health care trend rates do not have a significant effect on the total service and interest cost components or on the post-retirement benefit obligation amounts reported for the U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan for the year ended October 31, 2018.13.   GUARANTEESStandard WarrantyWe accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product shipments. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. The standard warranty accrual balances are held in other accrued and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Our standard warranty terms typically extend to one years from the date of delivery, depending on the product.91Table of Contents            A summary of the standard warranty accrual activity is shown in the table below. The standard warranty accrual balances are held in other accrued and other long-term liabilities. October 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Balance as of October 31, 2017 and 2016$34 $35Accruals for warranties including change in estimates53 53Settlements made during the period(52) (54)Balance as of October 31, 2018 and 2017$35 $34Accruals for warranties due within one year35 33Accruals for warranties due after one year— 1Balance as of October 31, 2018 and 2017$35 $34Indemnifications in Connection with TransactionsIn connection with various divestitures, acquisitions, spin-offs and other transactions, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties, their affiliates and/or other related parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future.  These indemnifications may cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, environmental, intellectual property, litigation and other liabilities related to the business conducted prior to the date of the transaction.  In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2018.  Indemnifications to Officers and DirectorsOur corporate by-laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent and such other entities, including service with respect to employee benefit plans. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by-laws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by-laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2018.Other IndemnificationsAs is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October 31, 2018.In connection with the sale of several of our businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of such business, their respective affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that they might incur in the future. The continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to the buyers, as well as other specified items. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2018.92Table of Contents            14.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESOperating Lease Commitments:    We lease certain real and personal property from unrelated third parties under non-cancelable operating leases.  Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance, and include escalation clauses. Total rent expense was $64 million in 2018, $57 million in 2017 and $61 million in 2016.Future minimum lease payments and future minimum lease income under operating leases at October 31, 2018:  Future Minimum Lease Payments Future Minimum Lease Income  (in millions)2019 $42 $92020 $35 $82021 $23 $92022 $13 $42023 $10 $—Thereafter $57 $—Other Purchase Commitments.   Typically, we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled were approximately $80 million. Approximately $27 million of the penalties for the new contracts will reduce over the next 15 years.Contingencies:    We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, commercial, real estate, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we currently believe are reasonably possible of having a material impact to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.15.   SHORT-TERM DEBTCredit FacilitiesOn September 15, 2014, Agilent entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution which provides for a $400 million five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on September 15, 2019. On June 9, 2015, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by $300 million and on July 14, 2017, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $1 billion. As of October 31, 2018, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017. 2017 Senior Notes                                               In October 2007, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes ("2017 senior notes"). On October 20, 2014, we settled the redemption of $500 million of the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2017 senior notes.  The 2017 senior notes were repayable within one year as of October 31, 2017 and were reclassified to short-term debt. The remaining $100 million in senior notes matured and were paid in full on November 1, 2017. 93Table of Contents            16.   LONG-TERM DEBTSenior NotesThe following table summarizes the company's long-term senior notes and the related interest rate swaps: October 31, 2018 October 31, 2017 AmortizedPrincipal Swap Total AmortizedPrincipal Swap Total (in millions)2020 Senior Notes$499 $7 $506 $499 $11 $5102022 Senior Notes399 — 399 398 — 3982023 Senior Notes597 — 597 596 — 5962026 Senior Notes297 — 297 297 — 297Total$1,792 $7 $1,799 $1,790 $11 $1,8012020 Senior NotesIn July 2010, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes ("2020 senior notes").

The asset value, including interest receivable, upon termination for these contracts was approximately $34 million and the amount to be amortized at October 31, 2018 was $7 million. The gain is being deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2020 senior notes.2022 Senior NotesIn September 2012, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $400 million in senior notes ("2022 senior notes"). The 2022 senior notes were issued at 99.80% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on October 1, 2022, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.20% per annum.

The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes.The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2018 was $7 million. 17.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITYStock Repurchase Program On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The program was designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares.  For the year ended October 31, 2016 we repurchased 2 million shares for $98 million which completed the purchases under this authorization.On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2015 repurchase program"). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  During the year ended October 31, 2016,  upon the completion of our previous repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares for $336 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares for $194 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2018 we repurchased and retired approximately 6.4 million shares for $422 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2018, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $188 million of our common stock under this program which expired on November 1, 2018.On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2019 repurchase program") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time.  Cash Dividends on Shares of Common Stock During the year ended October 31, 2018, cash dividends of $0.596 per share, or $191 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock.

The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.95Table of Contents            Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)The following table summarizes the components of our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of October 31, 2018 and 2017, net of tax effect: October 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Foreign currency translation, net of tax expense of $(15) and $(8) for 2018 and 2017, respectively$(214) (156)Unrealized losses (including prior service benefit) on defined benefit plans, net of tax benefit of $132 and $127 for 2018 and 2017, respectively(201) (188)Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net of tax benefit of $0 and $2 for 2018 and 2017, respectively7 (2)Total accumulated other comprehensive loss$(408) $(346)Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component and related tax effects for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions):    Net defined benefit pension cost and post retirement plan costs      Foreign currency translation Prior service credits Actuarial Losses Unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives Total  (in millions)As of October 31, 2016 $(197) $146 $(451) $(1) $(503)           Other comprehensive income before reclassifications 44 — 116 — 160           Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income — (9) 59 (1) 49           Tax (expense) benefit (3) 3 (52) — (52)           Other comprehensive income (loss) 41 (6) 123 (1) 157           As of October 31, 2017 $(156) $140 $(328) $(2) $(346)           Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (51) — (49) 7 (93)           Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income — (8) 39 4 35           Tax (expense) benefit (7) 2 3 (2) (4)           Other comprehensive income (loss) (58) (6) (7) 9 (62)           As of October 31, 2018 $(214) $134 $(335) $7 $(408)           96Table of Contents            Reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions):   Details about Accumulated OtherComprehensive Income componentsAmounts Reclassifiedfrom Other Comprehensive IncomeAffected line item instatement of operations20182017Unrealized gains and (losses) on derivatives$(4)$1Cost of products and interest expense(4)1Total before income tax1—(Provision)/benefit for income tax(3)1Total net of income taxNet defined benefit pension cost and post retirement plan costs:Actuarial net loss(39)(59)Cost of sales and operating expensesPrior service benefit89Cost of sales and operating expenses(31)(50)Total before income tax1014(Provision)/benefit for income tax(21)(36)Total net of income taxTotal reclassifications for the period$(24)$(35)Amounts in parentheses indicate reductions to income and increases to other comprehensive income.Reclassifications of prior service benefit and actuarial net loss in respect of retirement plans and post retirement pension plans are included in the computation of net periodic cost (see Note 12, "Retirement Plans and Post Retirement Pension Plans").18.   SEGMENT INFORMATIONDescription of Segments.  We are a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. Agilent has three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business each of which comprises a reportable segment. The three operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and services and manufacturing are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments.In 2018, we re-organized our operating segments and moved our microfluidics business from our life sciences and applied markets operating segment to our diagnostics and genomics operating segment. Following this re-organization, we continue to have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business. All historical financial segment information for both the life sciences and applied markets segment and the diagnostics and genomics segment has been recast to reflect this reorganization in our financial statements.97Table of Contents            A description of our three reportable segments is as follows:Our life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography ("LC") systems and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ("LCMS") systems; gas chromatography ("GC") systems and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry ("GCMS") systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ("ICP-MS") instruments; atomic absorption ("AA") instruments; microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (“MP-AES”) instruments; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry ("ICP-OES") instruments; raman spectroscopy, cell analysis plate based assays, flow cytometer; real-time cell analyzer, laboratory software for sample tracking, information management and analytics; laboratory automation and robotic systems; dissolution testing; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies.Our diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of six areas of activity providing active pharmaceutical ingredients ("APIs") for oligo-based therapeutics as well as solutions that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables, which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level. First, our genomics business includes arrays for DNA mutation detection, genotyping, gene copy number determination, identification of gene rearrangements, DNA methylation profiling, gene expression profiling, as well as next generation sequencing ("NGS") target enrichment and genetic data management and interpretation support software. This business also includes solutions that enable clinical labs to identify DNA variants associated with genetic disease and help direct cancer therapy. Second, our nucleic acid solutions business provides equipment and expertise focused on production of synthesized oligonucleotides under pharmaceutical good manufacturing practices ("GMP") conditions for use as API in an emerging class of drugs that utilize nucleic acid molecules for disease therapy. Third, our pathology solutions business is focused on product offerings for cancer diagnostics and anatomic pathology workflows. The broad portfolio of offerings includes immunohistochemistry (“IHC”), in situ hybridization (“ISH”), hematoxylin and eosin (“H&E”) staining and special staining. Fourth, we also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics, also known as companion diagnostics, which may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy. Fifth, the reagent partnership business is a provider of reagents used for turbidimetry and flow cytometry. Finally, our biomolecular analysis business provides complete workflow solutions, including instruments, consumables and software, for quality control analysis of nucleic acid samples.  Samples are analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques to ensure accuracy in further genomics analysis techniques utilized in clinical and life science research applications. The Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive consumables and services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes.  Most of the portfolio is vendor neutral, meaning Agilent can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument purchase choices.  Solutions range from chemistries and supplies to services and software helping to connect the entire lab.  Key product categories in consumables include GC and LC columns, sample preparation products, custom chemistries, and a large selection of laboratory instrument supplies.  Services include startup, operational, training and compliance support, software as a service, as well as asset management and consultative services that help increase customer productivity.  Custom service and consumable bundles are tailored to meet the specific application needs of various industries and to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements.A significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include legal, accounting, tax, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury, order administration, other corporate infrastructure expenses and costs of centralized research and development. Charges are allocated to the segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. In addition, we do not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, pension curtailment or settlement gains, restructuring and transformational initiatives expenses, acquisition and integration costs, business exit and divestiture costs, special compliance costs, some nucleic acid solutions division ("NASD) site costs and certain other charges to the operating margin for each segment because management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments.Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, in-sourcing or outsourcing of activities.The following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including segment income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.98Table of Contents            The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, transformational initiatives, investment gains and losses, interest income, interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, non-cash amortization and other items as noted in the reconciliations below. Life Sciences and Applied Markets Diagnostics and Genomics Agilent CrossLab TotalSegments (in millions)Year ended October 31, 2018:       Total net revenue$2,270 $943 $1,701 $4,914Income from operations$547 $178 $397 $1,122Depreciation expense$38 $33 $31 $102Share-based compensation expense$33 $14 $24 $71Year ended October 31, 2017:       Total net revenue$2,081 $860 $1,531 $4,472Income from operations$468 $168 $338 $974Depreciation expense$35 $30 $29 $94Share-based compensation expense$30 $10 $21 $61Year ended October 31, 2016:       Total net revenue$1,992 $790 $1,420 $4,202Income from operations$412 $131 $316 $859Depreciation expense$36 $31 $28 $95Share-based compensation expense$29 $10 $21 $60The following table reconciles reportable segments' income from operations to Agilent's total enterprise income before taxes: Years Ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Total reportable segments' income from operations$1,122 $974 $859Amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations(105) (117) (152)Acquisition and integration costs(23) (30) (41)Transformational initiatives(25) (12) (38)Asset Impairments(21) — (4)Business exit and divestiture costs ( primarily our NMR business)(9) — (11)Impairment of loans— — (7)NASD site costs(8) — —Pension curtailment gain— — 15Pension settlement gain5 32 1Special compliance costs(4) — —Other(4) (6) (7)Interest Income38 22 11Interest Expense(75) (79) (72)Other income (expense), net55 19 (10)Income before taxes, as reported$946 $803 $544Major Customers.    No customer represented 10 percent or more of our total net revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016.99Table of Contents            The following table reflects segment assets and capital expenditures under our management reporting system.

(ACEA), a developer of cell analysis tools, for approximately $250 million in cash. The financial results of ACEA will be included within our financial results from the date of the close. Due to the timing of the completion of the acquisition, our valuation for the tangible and intangible assets are not yet complete.On December 20, 2018, we received the Letters of Award from Singapore Authorities extending the company’s tax incentives in Singapore through December 30, 2027.  These incentives, coupled with application of the new accounting rules for income tax consequences of intra-entity transfer of assets as adopted on November 1, 2018, are expected to result in approximately $265 million benefit to our tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.   101Table of Contents            QUARTERLY SUMMARY(Unaudited) Three Months Ended January 31, April 30, July 31, October 31, (in millions, except per share data)2018      Net revenue$1,211 $1,206 $1,203 $1,294Gross profit673 644 661 709Income from operations239 215 225 249Net income (loss)(320) 205 236 195        Net income (loss) per share — Basic$(0.99) $0.64 $0.74 $0.61Net income (loss) per share — Diluted$(0.99) $0.63 $0.73 $0.61        Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share:       Basic323 322 320 319Diluted323 326 324 322        Cash dividends per common share$0.149 $0.149 $0.149 $0.149        2017       Net revenue$1,067 $1,102 $1,114 $1,189Gross profit574 592 596 647Income from operations206 201 201 233Net income168 164 175 177        Net income per share — Basic$0.52 $0.51 $0.55 $0.55Net income per share — Diluted$0.52 $0.50 $0.54 $0.54        Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share:       Basic322 321 321 322Diluted326 325 326 326        Cash dividends per common share$0.132 $0.132 $0.132 $0.132                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                102Table of Contents            Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.Item 9A.    Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2018, pursuant to and as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
