Sustainability Strategy and Analysis.3M’s Sustainability Vision.Our Vision.3M's commitment is to actively contribute to sustainable development through environmental protection, social responsibility and.economic progress. To us, that means meeting the needs of society today, while respecting the ability of future generations to meet.their needs..Corporate Values.3M's sustainability policies and practices are directly linked to our fundamental corporate values:.• Act with uncompromising honesty and integrity in everything we do..• Satisfy our customers with innovative technology and superior quality, value and service..• Provide our investors an attractive return through sustainable, global growth..• Respect our social and physical environment around the world..• Value and develop our employees' diverse talents, initiative and leadership..• Earn the admiration of all those associated with 3M worldwide..4.Sustainability Strategies.Strategic Principles.In 2008, 3M launched a project to develop three strategic principles around sustainability. 3M's strategies for sustainability encompass.the pursuit of customer satisfaction and commercial success within a framework of environmental, social and economic values. These.principles were developed to provide 3M businesses and corporate staff groups with a flexible framework to engage our customers and.key stakeholders around sustainability including help our customers address environmental challenges through 3M products and.technologies..• Economic Success: Build lasting customer relationships by developing differentiated, practical and ingenious solutions to their.sustainability challenges..• Environmental Protection: Provide practical and effective solutions and products to address environmental challenges for.ourselves and our customers..• Social Responsibility: Engage key stakeholders in dialogue and take action to improve 3M’s sustainability performance..Key Objectives around Sustainable Development.For more than 100 years, 3M has achieved consistent, profitable growth by creating innovative products, establishing strong.relationships with customers and boosting operational efficiency. At the same time, we've created a culture that promotes employee.pride and well-being, fosters integrity and supports social and environmental responsibility. Each year, 3M continues to move toward.sustainability and strives to raise the bar on corporate environmental, social and economic management. In order to ensure continuous.improvement, we annually reevaluate and/or identify new key sustainability objectives for the company..These key issues are identified through 3M's management systems such as ISO 14001, Six Sigma methodology, and feedback from.our stakeholders. A few of 3M's key objectives around sustainable development include:.3M's Key Objectives.• Manage our environmental footprint..• Develop solutions that address environmental and social challenges for our customers and society..• Assuring our products are safe for their intended use through their entire life cycle..• Assuring the appropriate management of any 3M health and safety issues that may touch customers, neighbors and the.public..• Maintaining a safe and healthy workplace..• Satisfying our customers with superior quality and value..• Providing a supportive, flexible work environment..• Supporting local needs and education in communities where 3M employees live and work..• Conduct our business with the uncompromising honesty and integrity..• Provide an attractive return for our investors..5.3M’s Governance Structure.3M's actions are guided by our corporate values of uncompromising honesty and integrity. We are proud to be recognized worldwide as.an ethical and law-abiding company. As a company, we are committed to sustainable development through environmental protection,.social responsibility and economic progress. Our guiding principles in this endeavor include a commitment to making decisions based.on sound science..The 3M Board of Directors addresses sustainability issues by:.• Reviewing public policy and social trends affecting 3M..• Monitoring the company's corporate citizenship activities..• Evaluating company policies and programs to enable 3M to respond appropriately to its social responsibilities and the public.interest in the conduct of its businesses, including activities related to the improvement of the environment and community.relations..3M's Corporate Environmental, Health and Safety Committee and its Business Conduct Committee consist of 3M executives and set.policies and directions to move the company toward sustainability. 3M's environmental, medical, safety, human resources, community.affairs and other staff groups provide the technical expertise to help business units carry out 3M's sustainability policies and directions..• 3M's Leadership Team: http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=80574&p=irol-govmanage.3M's Board of Directors, an Independent Body.3M's Board of Directors believes in having a substantial majority of independent directors on the 3M Board. Pursuant to the New York.Stock Exchange listing standards, the board has adopted Director Qualification Standards concerning the determination of director.independence. In accordance with these standards, the board must affirmatively determine that a director has no material relationship.with the company (directly or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company) other.6.than as a director. The 3M Board of Directors has determined that every director, with the exception of the Chairman, President, and.Chief Executive Officer, George W. Buckley, is independent under these standards..Maintaining Excellence.The Board's Nominating and Governance Committee periodically reviews with the 3M board the requisite skills and characteristics of its.members. 3M's Corporate Governance Guidelines contain Board Membership Criteria that apply to nominees for a position on 3M's.Board of Directors. The committee periodically reviews with the board the appropriate skills and characteristics required of board.members given the current board composition. It is the intent of the board that the board, itself, be a high performance organization.creating competitive advantage for 3M. To perform as such, the board is composed of individuals who have distinguished records of.leadership and success in their arena of activity and who will make substantial contributions to board operations and effectively.represent the interests of all stockholders..Identifying Opportunities & Risks in Relating to Sustainable Development.The Board's Public Issues Committee reviews public policy issues and trends affecting the company. It also reviews and advises on.3M's environmental, health and safety programs and compliance, human resources programs, as well as corporate contributions and.3M Foundation programs. It also reviews and approves the company's response to stockholder proposals relating to public policy.issues. In addition, the committee:.• Monitors 3M's corporate citizenship activities..• Offers advice, insights and makes recommendations regarding policies, programs, actions and procedures to enable 3M to.continue to respond appropriately to our social responsibilities and the public interest in our business affairs, including.activities related to the environment, human resources, labor and community relations..The Board of Directors has determined that all Public Issues Committee members are \"independent\" under the New York Stock.Exchange listing standards..Shareholder Input.3M values shareholder input. Stockholders may communicate with the chairs of the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance,.and Public Issues Committees of the board, or with our independent directors, by sending a letter to the following address: 3M.Company, c/o Corporate Secretary, 3M Center, Building 0220-13W-39, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000..Business Conduct.Throughout 3M's more than 100 years, we have worked hard to earn our reputation of trust, integrity and ethical business practices..Guiding us are 3M's Business Conduct Policies and the values that are at the core of our company. Our Business Conduct Policies.spell out what lawful and ethical conduct mean in every aspect of our operations -- from key decisions about 3M's strategic direction to.everyday decisions and conduct on the job everywhere in the world where 3M does business..Although 3M has business operations in more than 65 countries, we have only one set of Business Conduct Polices that apply globally..It sets a high standard of conduct for every employee. The 3M Business Conduct Manual helps define our everyday ethical and lawful.business conduct. This manual is available to employees electronically and in print..All 3M employees, supervisors, managers and other leaders are responsible for understanding the legal and policy requirements that.apply to their jobs and for reporting any suspected violations of the law or 3M's Business Conduct Policies. Training is provided to help.employees understand their responsibilities and the resources available to them. Executives and managers also are accountable for.creating and promoting, by sound leadership and good example, a workplace environment in which compliance and ethical business.conduct are expected and encouraged..• 3M’s Business Conduct Web Portal: http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/businessconduct/bcmain/.• 3M's Business Conduct Policies:.http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/businessconduct/bcmain/?WT.mc_id=www.3m.com/businessconduct.7.• CEO Commitment to Legal and Ethical Business Conduct:.http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/businessconduct/bcmain/ceo/ceochairman/.• Investigations and Findings: http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/businessconduct/bcmain/about/additional-info/.3M Public Policy.With operations in more than 65 nations and leading positions in a wide range of businesses and markets, developing 3M public.policies can be a complex process. 3M manages this challenge by working with local, national and international government agencies.and through membership organizations. In the United States, an evaluation process developed by the 3M Public Affairs Department.establishes a public policy agenda of issues impacting our businesses. Internationally, 3M managing directors of host country.businesses are responsible for evaluating and determining key government issues in their respective countries..The Top-10 list of Public Policy Issues serves as a roadmap for company activities to include lobbying, trade association work,.executive involvement, political contributions, grassroots communications and advocacy involving employees and retirees, as well as.meetings with federal and state government officials. In selecting which priority issues make 3M's Top-10 list, the company uses a.number of screens. Chief among theses screens are issues with the potential to significantly affect 3M's financial performance and/or.our corporate reputation. Other screens are immediacy of impact on the company; situations in which 3M may be uniquely advantaged.or disadvantaged; importance based on instinct and/or history; or employee/retiree satisfaction. This list of priorities helps the.Corporate Public Affairs team focus on those issues that have the greatest impact on the company. Finally, and probably most.importantly, the Top-10 list of issues helps to ensure that the many faces of 3M always speak with a single, unified voice. Bottom line:.the Top-10 list serves as the guide for advancing 3M's public policy goals and growth-through-government objectives..Example: Top 10 3M Public Policy Issues in the United States (as of May, 2011).1. Tax Policy − Tax reform is essential to ensuring the long-term competitiveness of American businesses and workers..3M believes business tax reform should focus on a significant reduction of the corporate income tax rate, making the.research credit permanent, creating incentives for U.S.-based IP ownership and simplifying the tax code..2. Health Care Policy – The U.S. health system should remain market-driven and efforts to address the uninsured.should not weaken the current employer-based coverage system. 3M believes implementation of the health care.law should focus on increasing efficiencies within the system as well as improving quality outcomes and patient.safety..3. Environmental Policy – Environmental policy and regulations should be guided by science-based decision making.and a commitment to sustainability. Over a decade ago, 3M began to make significant investments that were.designed to reduce its environmental impacts; those investments continue today. 3M supports prudent and.meaningful actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, we support the development of a cap-and-.trade system for these emissions, so long as the system provides credit for companies (like 3M) that already have.achieved significant reductions..4. Homeland Security – 3M believes our nation’s homeland security and defense preparedness should be.strengthened through improved border and immigration security, improved force protection measures, additional.support for first responders, and planning for pandemics or other national emergencies..5. Energy Policy – National (and state) policies should ensure a continuous, reliable and uninterrupted supply of.energy at competitive rates. 3M supports policies that address new sources of energy, alternative energy, faster.adoption of technology and improved energy efficiency..6. International Trade Policy – 3M believes the U.S. economy and American jobs depend on the expansion of free.and fair trade through the passage of new trade agreements, such as those pending with the Republic of Korea,.Panama, and Colombia. Additionally, 3M supports renewal of the president’s Trade Promotion Authority so as to.allow additional agreements to be negotiated. International trade policy also requires a level playing field, including.recognition, protection, and enforcement of intellectual property rights and trading rules..8.7. Transportation Infrastructure Policy – The maintenance and improvement of the nation’s transportation.infrastructure – which is important to 3M as a supplier of traffic safety and construction products, and as a user of the.system – can only be achieved if the Highway Trust Fund remains solvent. 3M believes all highway user fees should.be dedicated to the fund; additional steps should be taken to crack down on fuel tax evasion; and Congress should.consider other measures, if necessary, to ensure the fund’s solvency..8. Economic Development Policy – 3M supports state government policies designed to incentivize capital investment.and sustainable job creation. In particular, we believe state tax policy should reward both job creation and plant.expansion and modernization investments. Worker training programs are also an important tool in a state’s economic.development portfolio. Additionally, ongoing regulatory reform should always be a part of the mix..9. Labor Policy – 3M supports the full measure of rights provided to employers and employees under the National.Labor Relations Act. This federal law allows both employers and unions the opportunity to explain the advantages of.having a union or not. A key provision of the Act allows employees to cast their vote, either to accept or reject union.representation, in a secret ballot election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. 3M opposes any.legislative or regulatory efforts to diminish or eliminate secret ballot elections for employees..10. Retirement Security – Retirement security relies on a balance of Social Security, pensions and private savings. 3M.believes government policies should ensure the viability of all options while maintaining the ability of employers to.provide and effectively manage retirement benefits to employees..3M Public Policy Issues Evaluation Process.3M’s list of Top 10 public policy priorities helps the 3M Corporate Public Affairs team focus on issues that have the greatest impact on.the company. The Top 10 List helps communicate 3M’s perspective and guides its activities in the areas of lobbying, trade association.work, political contributions, grassroots communications and advocacy involving employees and retirees, as well as in meetings with.federal and state government officials..The overall objectives of 3M’s Top 10 public policies are to:.• Make the case for tax reform and lower U.S. corporate tax rates for a more level global playing field..• Make the case for reducing the burden and costs of unnecessary U.S. regulations to allow for stronger global competition..• Advance legislation that is in the best interest of 3M employees, retirees and the company as a whole..• Help 3M businesses sell their products to federal, state and local governments..Economic Management: Building an Even Stronger 3M.A recognized leader in research and development, 3M produces thousands of innovative products for dozens of diverse markets. 3M’s.core strength is applying its 45 distinct technology platforms – often in combination – to a wide array of customer needs..The Company’s Key Strengths.• Strong Technology Base.Virtually anywhere you go, 3M technologies are at work – making life easier and better for people around the world. You’ll find.3M technologies and products in homes, offices, hospitals, dental offices, manufacturing facilities, cars, aircraft, traffic signs,.LCD displays and countless other places. Drawing on more than 40 technology platforms, 3M employees use their.imagination to develop products that transform existing industries and create entirely new ones..9.• Leading Market Positions.3M is a world leader in most of its businesses. We’ve created many markets, frequently by developing products that fulfill.unarticulated customer needs..• Healthy Mix of Businesses.3M serves a broad array of markets, providing many avenues for growth and cushioning the company from disruptions in any.single market. 3M has a worldwide presence in the following markets: consumer and office; display and graphics; electro and.communications; health care; industrial and transportation; and safety, security and protection services..• Well-Known Brands.Representing quality, innovation and reliability, 3M brands earn customer loyalty, encourage repeat purchases and motivate.users to try new 3M products..• Worldwide Presence.We have companies in more than 65 countries around the world, and we sell our products in nearly 200 countries. More than.half of our sales are outside the United States..3M’s Four Elements of Strategic Focus.George W. Buckley became 3M Chairman, President and Chief Executive Office effective December 7, 2005. In May of 2006, Buckley.outlined four elements of strategic focus that comprise the company’s emerging strategy for growth. These strategies remain in force.today:.• Grow the current core business.\"We'll build first where 3M is strong, defend and expand market presence, and build size and scale.

These new goals were endorsed by 3M’s CEO (George.10.Buckley) and the Corporate Operating Committee in November 2010.

Environmental, Health, and Safety Management.3M's Environmental, Health and Safety Management System.3M's Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Management System promotes sound environmental, health and safety management at.our facilities worldwide. It helps us address changing customer needs and expectations as we continue to drive sustainable growth..The EHS Management System:.• Builds on the strengths of our previous environmental, health and safety achievements..• Includes an integrated, holistic system that anticipates and addresses long-term issues and drives continuous improvement..• Requires each business unit to identity EHS issues, develop formal prioritized action plans, set goals and measure results..• Promotes a strategic planning process that integrates EHS issue resolution into business unit strategic plans..• Requires a Life Cycle Management review of all new products and of existing products on a prioritized basis..As a result of good planning and priority setting, resources can be efficiently allocated to maximize EHS improvement..Safety and Health Management.3M Framework for Strong Safety and Health Performance.3M has a long history of ensuring the safety and health of our employees. Our Safety and Health Policy applies to all 3M operations.worldwide, including new acquisitions. The policy confirms 3M’s commitment to protecting the health and safety of those working at or.visiting a 3M location. It holds all visitors, vendors, contractors and contract workers at 3M locations to the same safety and health.requirements that it holds for 3M employees. Based on our core business values, the policy stems from our vision for “Safe and.Healthy People, Products and Planet.” The business process to manage safety and health performance is a disciplined cycle of risk.analysis and planning. Goals are set for performance improvements that are measured and tracked on a regular basis. A quarterly.EHS Scorecard monitors a variety of metrics. Scorecard results are used to make program adjustments. Then, the results become.critical input for future analysis and planning..Planning & Performance.Performance Expectations – 3M Global Safety & Health Plan.In 1996, a Global Safety & Health Plan was initiated for all 3M locations worldwide, meeting the overall intent of the 3M Safety and.Health Policy. The Global Safety & Health Plan is a system of standards categorized into multiple elements addressing various areas of.safety and health, including prevention of injuries and illnesses, prevention of unplanned events such as fires and explosions and.promotion of 24-hour safety and health. Through implementation of this plan, each location develops safety and health management.systems, identifies gaps in their safety and health programs/performance, and develops plans to close any gaps and drive continuous.improvement in their own safety and performance..Performance Assessment.The Global Safety & Health Plan is an integral part of our safety and health management system, which allows locations to assess their.current status versus safety and health systems requirements. Using a standardized approach allows meaningful performance results.to be shared throughout the company. Indicators such as reduced injury/illness rates and days away from work are sometimes used as.goals for improved safety and health performance. However, 3M prefers to focus on measurements of preventive actions taken.(leading performance indicators), which would tend to reduce the total number and/or severity of incidents..3M Global Safety & Health Plan.3M has developed and maintains a variety of performance standards collectively known as the.14.3M Global Safety & Health Plan (GSHP). These standards provide a roadmap to help 3M locations in the prevention of injuries and.illnesses; unplanned events, such as fires and explosions; and to promote 24-hour safety and health. The standards help facilities meet.the overall intent of the 3M Safety and Health Policy..The GSHP standards are categorized under the following elements:.• Management System Elements.Requirements include Local Safety and Health Plans, Safety and Health Committees, Performance Appraisals, Staffing and.Qualifications, Self Evaluations, Maintaining Records, Employee engagement, Orientation and Training, and 24-hour Safety.and Health.• Process Elements.Requirements include Chemical Exposure Assessment / Management, Ergonomics, and Process Safety.• Procedural Elements.Requirements include Incident Management, Hazard Reporting, Contractor Safety and Health, and Emergency Preparedness.• Medical Elements.Requirements include Employee Monitoring to Noise and Other Exposures for Bodily Harm.• Chemical Hazard Elements.Requirements include Communication and Training Programs and Use of Protective Equipment.• Physical Hazard Elements.Requirements include Electrical Safety, Machine Guarding and Fire Prevention.Continuous Improvement; Plan, Do, Check, Act.By implementing the 3M Global Safety & Health Plan, locations determine their significant safety and health issues. They use risk.management tools to prioritize these issues and develop action plans to close the gaps. Measures are developed and used to drive.improvement in their safety and health performance..Performance results are reviewed against these measures and further improvement actions are taken as needed. The chart below.demonstrates this continuous improvement cycle..Execution of Compliance and Risk Management Activities.3M develops and/or provides corporate data management systems and tools to support facilities’ issues and incident tracking and.response. A standardized approach for worldwide operations provides meaningful performance results that can be shared throughout.the company..Standardized systems and tools include:.• Incident and Injury/Illness Reporting.• Environmental Releases.15.• Chemical and Noise Exposure Risk Management.• Ergonomic Risk Management.• Various Risk Assessment Calculators.Promoting Health.Ergonomics.3M has increasingly focused on identifying and preventing illnesses and injuries related to ergonomic factors. 3M’s Ergonomics.Program consists of a management system for hazard awareness, standard risk assessment tools and implementation of ergonomic.solutions. With increasing effectiveness of our ergonomics programs, plus employee education on the signs and symptoms of.musculoskeletal disorders, the frequency and severity of ergonomics injuries has improved significantly. And along with that comes.continued improvements in productivity and quality..Our ergonomics program is defined in 3M’s Global Safety & Health Plan and applies to all global operations. The program includes.requirements for annual planning, application of standard risk assessment tools, development of skilled location resources and.ergonomics training for all employees. For over 18 years, the objectives of 3M’s Ergonomics Program have been to:.• Reduce the impact and costs of work-related injury and process inefficiency.• Improve employee health and job satisfaction.• Enhance human performance.• Increase efficiency of production.Exposure Risk Assessment & Management.3M’s approach to recognizing, understanding and managing potential exposure risks during manufacturing and throughout a product’s.life cycle is embedded in our vision for “Safe and Healthy People, Products and Planet.” To ensure that health-related issues are.responsibly addressed for the workplace and 3M products, 3M employs Life Cycle Management for health risk analysis during a.product's development and throughout its life cycle. 3M monitors scientific and medical developments and offers guidance, tools and.education to help employees and customers understand and manage any risks associated with 3M products..Promoting Safety.Life Safety.3M facilities around the world promote Life Safety with regular attention to hazard identification and special measures for the well-being.of employees who may be exposed to potential risk. Life Safety Programs involve minimizing and controlling situations when a job.involves an unusual risk for severe injury, illness or death. In addition to ongoing safety training, employees are encouraged to take.responsibility and authority for their own health and safety, as well as that of their peers. At the same time, knowledge and ideas.pertaining to potential risks are exchanged across functions, organizations and nations..Process Hazard Management.3M Process Hazard Management complements 3M's safety and health efforts worldwide by promoting systematic management of.safety and proper training throughout all operations. Using a risk-based approach, the Process Hazard Management Program helps.prevent hazardous chemical releases or conditions that have the potential to cause fires or explosions. Critical control requirements,.along with performance monitoring, support continuous improvement goals set by 3M facilities..16.Health & Safety Metrics.Metric Type Unit 2008 2009 2010.Employees (100%.Employees and.Lost Time Injuries Frequency Contingent number/million hours.Rate (LTFIR) Workers) worked 2.58 2.48 1.82.Contractors.Lost Time Injuries Frequency (Contractor number/million hours.Rate (LTFIR) Employees) worked NA 8.73 8.38.Occupational Illness Employees and number/million hours.Frequency Rate (OIFR)-US Contractors worked 4.19 3.74 3.45.Occupational Illness.Frequency Rate (OIFR)- Employees and number/million hours Not Not.Worldwide Contractors worked Available Available 1.53.Employees (work.Fatalities related) Total 0 0 1.Contractors.Fatalities (work-related) Total 0 0 0.LTIFR Clarification: 3M begins recording LTIFR on the 1st full day absent (date of injury is not counted). 3M uses hours paid to calculate LTIFR and.The absence hours are extracted from the hours paid and are not included in the LTIFR (which includes paid and unpaid leaves of absence including.sick, vacation, family medical leave, etc.) Missed days is based on missed calendar days, not scheduled shifts..Sustaining the Environment.3M has been working to reduce the environmental impact of its products and processes since the late 1960s. In 1975, 3M’s.commitment to the environment was formalized when the Board of Directors adopted the 3M Environmental Policy. This global.environmental policy, which is believed to be the first policy with measurable results from a major manufacturing company, is a.comprehensive statement of 3M’s environmental commitment with special emphasis on preventing the creation of pollution..Also in 1975, years before it became clear that environmental and business concerns could be mutually supportive, 3M introduced the.voluntary Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) program. The 3P program has been successful beyond our expectations. It also has helped.keep 3M facilities ahead of many regulatory requirements. By 2011, 36 years later, 3P ideas and initiatives from employees prevented.3 billion pounds of pollutants..3P provides much of the philosophical basis for 3M’s environmental, health and safety programs. The prevention, rather than treatment,.approach and extensive employee involvement are part of 3M’s culture..These are found in 3M’s Life Cycle Management process and are emphasized in the company’s environmental, energy, and health and.safety policies. Prevention and employee ingenuity also guide our comprehensive Environmental, Health and Safety Management.System, which requires continuous improvements toward sustainability through ever tougher environmental targets..We are pleased with our progress to date in reducing volatile organic air emissions, releases to water and solid waste. 3M has been a.leader in addressing climate change through energy efficiency, manufacturing process improvements and developing products that.help customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions..Looking forward, 3M will continue to set and achieve aggressive environmental, health and safety goals. We will continue to seek.partnerships with environmental organizations, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy’s.ENERGY STAR Program, to address climate change..And along the way, we will continue to help customers improve their own environmental footprints with energy saving and greenhouse.17.gas reducing products..35 Years of Preventing Pollution Through 3M’s Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) Program.3M’s Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) program celebrated its 35th anniversary in 2010. Over the last 36 years, the program has.prevented more than 3 billion pounds of pollutants and saved nearly $1.4 billion based on aggregated data from the first year of each.3P project. The 3P program helps prevent pollution at the source - in products and manufacturing processes - rather than removing it.after it has been created. When 3P was launched in 1975, the concept of applying pollution prevention on a companywide basis and.documenting the results was an industry first..The 3P program was updated in 2002 to provide more opportunities for participation by our research and development, logistics,.transportation, and packaging employees with the addition of new award categories and criteria..3P is a key element of our environmental strategy and in moving toward sustainability. 3P has achieved that status based on our belief.that a prevention approach is more environmentally effective, technically sound and economical than conventional pollution controls..Natural resources, energy and money are used to build conventional pollution controls, and more resources are consumed operating.them. Conventional control only constrains the problem temporarily; it does not eliminate the problem. 3P seeks to eliminate pollution at.the source through:.• Product reformulation..• Process modification..• Equipment redesign..• Recycling and reuse of waste materials..The 3P program depends directly on the voluntary participation of 3M employees. Innovative projects are recognized with 3P Awards..A 3P Coordinating Committee representing 3M’s engineering, manufacturing and laboratory organizations - and the Environmental,.Health and Safety group - administers the program..3M employees worldwide have completed over 8,600 3P projects. Projects must meet these criteria to receive formal recognition:.• Eliminate or reduce a pollutant..• Benefit the environment through reduced energy use or more efficient use of manufacturing materials and resources..• Save money - through avoidance or deferral of pollution control equipment costs, reduced operating and materials expenses, or.increased sales of an existing or new product..A special award also recognizes projects that demonstrate technical innovation..2010 3P Results.• 533 projects submitted.• $75 million saved.• 122 thousand pounds of pollution prevented.• Nearly 1.8 million metric tons of CO -equivalent Greenhouse Gas emissions prevented.2.Dr Joseph Ling, The Father of Pollution Prevention.Dr. Joseph Ling, 3M’s former Staff Vice President, Environmental Engineering and Pollution Control, was a pioneer in the field of.environmental and air quality management and is recognized, worldwide, as the father of pollution prevention. Throughout Dr Ling’s.distinguished career he revolutionized the way society understands and manages its environmental impacts. He was one of the first.individuals to articulate and embrace a holistic approach to environmental management that considers the environmental impacts to all.media (air, water, and land) when evaluating policy and program decisions. As early as 1971, Dr. Ling advocated this holistic approach.in his testimony before the U.S. Congress regarding the creation of new drinking water quality regulations. Dr. Ling argued that the.proposed legislation, which relied heavily on pollution controls, would generate significant air pollution and waste through its.implementation and that pollution prevention was a more prudent approach..18.Dr. Ling took his novel ideas one step further by integrating them into 3M’s business processes. In 1975, Dr. Ling launched 3M’s.revolutionary Pollution Prevention Pays program or 3P. The 3P program is based on the reality that pollution prevention is more.environmentally effective, technically sound and economical than conventional pollution control equipment. 3P seeks to eliminate.pollution at the source through product reformulation, process modification, equipment redesign, and the recycling and reuse of waste.materials..The program has been instrumental in helping 3M to reduce its volatile organic air emissions through a series of projects ranging from.the creation of new products with fewer emissions to the transition from solvent to water based adhesives. While Dr. Ling’s impact on.3M’s operations and air emissions was vast, his greatest impact comes from his work to spread these ideas globally. In 1976, Dr. Ling.first presented his ideas at the Non-Waste Technology and Production Conference sponsored by the United Nations Economic.Commission for Europe. Shortly after, countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Sweden adopted pollution.prevention as a formal part of their environmental policies and Dr. Ling was approached by the Director of the United Nations.Environmental Program to develop a booklet explaining these theories for distribution to UN member countries. In addition, Dr. Ling.further spread these ideas by serving as an advisor to three sitting U.S. presidents, the United Nations, and the U.S. EPA; serving as a.delegate to the U.S. –U.S.S.R environmental treaty in 1979; speaking at conferences throughout the United Sates, Europe, and Asia;.and serving on numerous boards and associations. Up until his death in 2005, Dr. Ling continued to advocate a holistic, pollution.prevention approach and donate his time to advancing proactive, science based environmental decision making..Climate Change & Energy Management.Reducing Greenhouse Gases.Greenhouse gas emission reductions have been a long time priority for 3M. Although the science of global climate change is evolving,.3M has taken and continues to take voluntary, responsible action to reduce GHG emissions. 3M reduces its global greenhouse gas.emissions (including both the basket of greenhouse gases outlined in the Kyoto protocol and other greenhouse gases not included in.the protocol) through manufacturing process improvements, energy conservation and additional pollution control equipment. Since.1990, 3M has reduced worldwide, absolute GHG emissions by 72%..Rigorous greenhouse gas accounting systems and reduction goals are key components of 3M’s greenhouse gas management strategy..3M develops an annual inventory of its greenhouse gas emissions worldwide using the World Resource Institute/World Business.Council for Sustainable Development GHG Protocol. See “Corporate Sustainability Goals.”.19.Million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions (includes Kyoto & non-Kyoto gases).1990 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010.U.S. GHG 16.3 15.9 11.4 9.6 8.1 6.7 5.1 3.4 3.9.Emissions.Worldwide 22.1 17.8 17.9 13.5 11.6 10.3 8.5 6.8 5 6.2.GHG.Emissions.Worldwide 11.9 10.2 8.7 6.7 5.1 3.2 4.3.Direct.(Scope 1).GHG.Emissions.Worldwide 1.6 1.5 1.5 1.7 1.7 1.7 1.9.Indirect.(Scope 2).GHG.Emissions.**Totals vary due to rounding.Results:.• 3M reduced worldwide, absolute GHG emissions, in 2010, by 72% from a 1990 base year..• 3M reduced U.S., absolute GHG emissions, in 2010, by 76% from a 2002 base year..• In 2005, 3M exceeded its goal to reduce energy use indexed to net sales by 20% off a 2000 base year, reducing energy use by.29%..Investing in Renewable Energy.3M is also working to manage its greenhouse gas emissions impact by purchasing and installing on-site renewable energy..• In 2006, 3M’s Perth, Canada plant began installing a 2,000 square foot solar wall on the south side of the warehouse. The solar.wall is expected to displace 329 million Btu’s of electricity for the site each year. The new wall will both preheat the air and reduce.the building transmission loss..• 3M has been purchasing wind energy at its Austin, Texas location since March of 2001. This location purchases approximately.1,250,000 kWh annually equaling 13% of its annual energy use..In addition, 3M is also exploring opportunities to utilize landfill gas, on-site and off-site wind energy, and biodiesel at other 3M locations..Product Carbon Footprints.A product carbon footprint is the total amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are released through the products life.cycle. This includes but is not limited to creating or growing and harvesting raw materials, manufacturing, transport, storage, use and.disposal of the product by the consumer. Today, there are only a few guidance documents available, which when utilized do not.enable easy comparison of Carbon Footprint numbers between products. 3M is applying current available standards and is working the.World Resource Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI / WBCSD), peer companies, governments,.and environmental organizations to develop a common system..Helping Our Customers Address Climate Change through 3M Products.One of 3M core business strategies is to build lasting customer relationships by developing differentiated, practical, and ingenious.solutions to their sustainability challenges..20.Consumers may not realize that some televisions use up a good chunk of electricity in their homes. 3M is inventing a better tomorrow.by helping customers reduce their environmental footprint with innovative products like 3M™ Dual Brightness Enhancement Film.(DBEF) designed to help cut LCD TV energy consumption by up to 32 percent. This is just one example of 3M know-how enabling the.development of entire families of energy-saving products for customers, while reducing its own environmental footprint..“At 3M, we are experts at problem-solving, whether it’s our own environmental challenges or that of our customers. Harnessing the.chain reaction of new ideas, we create game-changing technologies and products in the sustainability space,” said Fred Palensky, 3M.Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President, Research and Development..3M DBEF, for example, improves the efficiency of LCD TVs by recycling polarized light making TVs more energy efficient -- and with.the advantages of a thinner and lighter television..Architectural Lighting.More than that, 3M researchers are developing alternative lighting options for buildings. 3M™ Sunlight Delivery System, which tracks,.captures and transports the sun’s natural, full visible spectrum daylight deep into the interior spaces of buildings where natural lighting.is limited. By harvesting free and abundant light from the sun, the Sunlight Delivery System provides a sustainable, energy-efficient.lighting that results in reduced energy demand during high cost, on peak hours. This product incorporates artificial lighting and controls.when the sky is overcast and for nighttime. Plus, use of this system contributes to LEED /sustainable building code certification..Energy Conservation.3M doesn’t stop with products that capture and transport light. The company’s Prestige Series window films use non-metalized nano-.technology to create reflectivity that's actually lower than glass. Homeowners’ views remain true; the films do not distort the interior or.exterior aesthetics of a building. These innovative films comprise hundreds of layers, yet are as thin as a Post-it ® Note. They reject up.to 97% of the sun's heat-producing infrared (IR) light and 99.9% of ultraviolet (UV) rays to keep occupants cool and comfortable. 3M.Prestige Series films benefit commercial and residential buildings; 3M Crystalline Film for automobile applications minimize heat build.up inside vehicles..Fire Protection.Facility operators of commercial buildings can also reduce their environmental footprint with an entirely different technology platform..3M™ Novec™ 1230 Fluids are used in facility fire suppression and have an ozone depletion potential of zero and a global warming.potential of one. This enables facility managers to achieve a 99.9 reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in their critical function fire.suppression systems. Conventional products in this area are based on HFC technologies, and in addition to a large global warming.potential, the HFC products live in the atmosphere for 30 years when released, while the 3M Novec 1230 fluid has an atmospheric.lifetime of five days. Unlike water, the fluid will not damage sensitive computer, telecommunications, data or hospital equipment.Additional information Related to Energy & Climate.• 3M Joins the Clinton Climate Initiative:.http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/WF/3MWindowFilms/CustomerSupport/ClintonClimateInitiative/.• 3M Provides Electrical Vehicle Charging Stations for 3M’s Employees and Guests at 3M’s Headquarters.http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/3m/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&ndmConfigId=1000940&newsId=20110210006.961&newsLang=en&vnsId=3M-Installs-Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Station-Guests.• 3M Solar Mirror Film Enhances Abengoa Solar Thermal Installation.http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/3m/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&ndmConfigId=1000941&newsId=20110302005.205&newsLang=en.• U.S. Energy Secretary Chu Tours 3M Headquarters.http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/3m/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&ndmConfigId=100094.1&newsId=20110221005121&newsLang=en.3M’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory Development.In order to better understand 3M’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions footprint and track progress towards the company’s GHG.emissions reduction goals, 3M has developed and maintains a worldwide GHG inventory. This inventory is developed and managed by.21.3M’s ISO/IEC 17025 certified Environmental Laboratory in accordance with the World Resource Institute/World Business Council for.Sustainable Development GHG Protocol..3M’s Environmental Laboratory documents all aspects of inventory data gathering according to laboratory’s standard operating.procedures (SOP) to ensure transparency. This data collection occurs annually using internally developed electronic systems. Each.inventory is reviewed by an on-site third party Quality Assurance Unit for completeness, accuracy, and transparency and each.inventory component is evaluated for uncertainty. In addition, 3M’s 2002 and 2007 GHG inventories were successfully verified by an.external third party..3M’s GHG inventory reflects the company’s diversity and complexity. Data from over 200 facilities are gathered via an electronic survey.and over 600 facilities are captured under 3M’s inventory. The inventory includes Kyoto and non-Kyoto emissions sources categorized.as WRI Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions..The corporate-wide inventory includes emissions from the following sources:.• Direct emissions of CO2 from stationary combustion of fossil fuels, waste and solvents..• Indirect emissions of CO2 from the use of electricity and steam..• Direct emissions of CH4 from wastewater treatment..• Direct emissions of CO2 from 3M-owned and leased mobile sources..• Direct process-related emissions of other greenhouse gases..Improving Energy Efficiency.Energy efficiency is an important part of reaching our GHG reduction goals. Strong energy conservation strategies have helped us.achieve an 81 percent improvement in energy efficiency in the United States since 1973. Improvements result from employee.programs that increase energy efficiency of existing operations, new equipment and facilities designed to be energy efficient, and the.development of new, more energy efficient 3M products and processes. Using Life Cycle Management, new product development.teams work to improve the energy efficiency of 3M products. They consider energy efficiency in their choices of raw materials, product.formulations and manufacturing processes..Since 1990, our energy requirements have increased with the installation of energy-intensive, pollution control equipment to reduce.emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). At the end of 2010, 3M had reduced VOCs by 95% from 1990 levels. 3M has been.making advances in solventless technology since 1990. As 3M’s solventless manufacturing processes advance, the need for emission.controls and associated energy demands will decrease..To drive continuous improvement in energy management, the company has set a goal to improve energy efficiency by 25% from 2005.– 2015..During 2010, 3M implemented 169 energy projects which saved $8.1 million and more than 542,000 MMBTUs. We continue to adopt.new methods to improve energy-efficiency, including the use of Six Sigma methodology and increasing our use of alternative,.renewable energy..Results:.• 81 percent improvement in energy efficiency at 3M's U.S. operations since 1973.• 46 percent improvement in energy efficiency at 3M's operations worldwide since 2000.• 25 percent improvement in energy efficiency from 2005 – 2010.22.23.Energy Use by Type.2006 Use 2007 Use 2008 Use 2009 Use 2010.Energy Source* (MMBtus) (MMBtus) (MMBtus) (MMBtus) (MMBtus).Electricity 9,300,000 9,600,000 9,240,000 8,400,000 9,500,000.Steam 800,000 820,000 800,000 730,000 800,000.Natural Gas 15,000,000 15,200,000 15,270,000 13,400,000 14,900,000.Fuel Oil (Number 1, 2, & 6) 1,500,000 1,100,000 1,070,000 750,000 690,000.Gasoline & Diesel 330,000 360,000 410,000 280,000 230,000.Propane & Jet Fuel 250,000 350,000 300,000 230,000 320,000.Coal 0 0 0 0 0.*Data covers 100% of manufacturing facilities and any 3M location greater than 2,800 square meters..**Totals vary due to rounding.Global Energy Use.YEAR millions GJ.2000 32.2001 29.2002 30.2003 29.2004 29.2005 29.2006 29.2007 29.2008 29.2009 25.2010 28.*Data covers 100% of manufacturing facilities and any 3M location greater than 2,800 square meters..More Efficient Packing Reduces Miles Traveled.3M has saved over $1 million per year and reduced miles traveled by more than 1,750,000 miles each year by eliminating the use of.pallets and loading to fill all of the available space in some of our trailer loading processes. This allows for more cartons to be loaded.into a trailer and ultimately reduces the number of trucks required to ship 3M's products. This practice reduces costs and conserves.natural resources..Spreading the word about Energy Efficiency: 3M Sponsors the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ENERGY STAR Exhibit House.at the Minnesota State Fair.3M teamed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR program to bring the ENERGY STAR Exhibit House to.the Minnesota State Fair to demonstrate 3M’s commitment to energy savings and spotlight some 3M energy-saving products. Through.the hands-on exhibit, fairgoers had the opportunity to learn about a variety of energy saving actions they can take in their homes..Reducing Air Emissions.One of 3M’s highest priorities is reducing volatile organic air emissions stemming from manufacturing and emissions of substances.listed on United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). The majority of 3M’s TRI releases are.air releases (during the 2006 reporting year, over 75% of 3M’s onsite TRI releases were releases to air)..Reductions have been accomplished through:.24.• Development of solventless technologies..• Pollution prevention programs..• Pollution control equipment..Results:.• 95 percent reduction in total pounds of volatile organic air emissions since 1990..• 99 percent reduction in total pounds of U.S. EPA TRI releases since 1990..• 3M’s global operations emitted 13 million pounds of volatile organic air emissions in 2010 compared with 255 million pounds in.1990 (1 pound = .454 kilograms)..• 3M released 2.2 million pounds of TRI releases in the United States in 2009 (2010 reporting year) compared with 69.5 million.pounds in 1990..25.Water Management.Water use and water quality are important global issues and 3M continues to work toward reducing our water releases and use. We.have been actively managing our water releases for many years. 3M wastewater receives a high degree of treatment to reduce its.environmental impact. We continue our improvement efforts today by investing in further pollution prevention projects and pollution.control equipment. In addition, 3M has been preventing water releases through the Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) program for 36.years. Since 1975, 3M has prevented over 131 million pounds of water releases (based on aggregated data from the first year of each.project)..26.3M is also working to reduce our water consumption through recycling and improvements to our buildings and manufacturing.processes. In 2010, 3M established a new goal around water management. The goal seeks to address water use in water stressed.and scare areas across the globe by requiring 3M manufacturing locations in those areas to establish water conservation plans to drive.continuous improvement in water management. The goal’s objectives are to focus reduction efforts where water availability is.threatened most and to promote engagement by 3M locations in those areas with their local communities..3M defines water stressed and scare areas according to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Global Water Tool..The Global Water Tool compares human use relative to renewable water resources per watershed. For more information on the Global.Water Tool:.http://www.wbcsd.org/templates/TemplateWBCSD5/layout.asp?type=p&MenuId=MTc1Mg&doOpen=1&ClickMenu=LeftMenu.27.Reducing Waste.Waste minimization is 3M’s most important strategy for reducing environmental releases. Waste is mostly unused raw materials. The.purchase of raw materials for manufacturing 3M products is a significant expense. So wasted raw materials (waste generation) is a.financial, as well as an environmental, issue..Results:.• 47 percent reduction in waste indexed to net sales in 2010 from a 2000 base year..• 66 percent reduction in waste indexed to net sales in 2010 from a 1990 base year..28.Redefining Waste for 3M’s Environmental Targets 2010 Program.In 2005, 3M revised its definition of waste and set a new, aggressive goal to reduce waste indexed to net sales in.2010 by 20%. The new definition considered materials that 3M sends to be recycled outside of 3M as waste. While 3M.has always promoted recycling, the new definition was established to challenge the company to find ways to prevent.the generation of waste in the first place. While difficult, the goal helped to increase focus on pollution prevention,.design changes in products and process, and on internal recycling and reuse programs. At the end of 2010, 3M had.reduced waste under the revised definition by 19%..Going forward, 3M has returned to a more traditional definition of waste and set a goal to reduce waste by an.additional 10%, indexed to net sales, between 2010-2015..Results:.Millions of Pounds of Waste by Recycling, Reuse, & Disposal Type.2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010.Offsite Reuse* 7,582 6,731 6,636 5,076 4,692 4,346.Onsite Recycle + Reuse* 3,928 3,690 2,860 2,020 2,020 1,874.Offsite Recycle 251 264 264 262 238 283.Treatment/ Incineration 104 100 95 82 64 87.Landfilled Waste 214 222 233 214 177 209.Waste-to-energy 78 91 79 79 71 83.* 3M’s “Offsite Reuse” and “Onsite Recycle + Reuse” values are significantly impacted by the reuse/recycling of mineral fines produced.as a byproduct during the producing of 3M roofing granules..Compliance with Mandatory Standards.3M’s goal is to be 100% compliant with all laws and regulations that impact our business. This applies to wherever 3M operates. In the.environmental area, this can create a complex matrix of local, regional and national regulations. 3M has adopted management systems.and resources to meet this complex web of global laws..US Compliance Metrics.2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010.Exceedances.(U.S. Only) 24 19 22 33 22 25.Spills (U.S..Only) 55 77 77 82 82 67 109.Agency.Notices (U.S..Only) 17 14 24 31 19 25.Fines ($US).(U.S. Only) $71,100 $20,782 $110,205 $11,742 $46,450 $8,892.29.2010 Global Compliance Metrics.• Exceedances: 31.• Spills: 95.• Agency Notices: 15.• Fines: $165,196.3M Remediation Program.3M’s early proactive installation of the corporate hazardous waste incinerator in 1972 had a major impact in reducing the number of.sites and the financial impact of landfill disposal sites to be remediated (cleaned up). In addition, our proactive assessments of 3M.manufacturing sites and waste disposal practices have led to the early identification of potential sites and earlier resolution..Remediation Sites.3M has been involved in a number of federal, state and voluntary remediation site clean-ups since the inception of the Superfund.program in 1980. To date, 3M has closed nearly 75 percent of these sites through formal settlements, regulatory closure agreements.and proactive voluntary cleanups..Environmental Remediation Reserves.Global Environmental Remediation Reserves have been set aside for 3M’s remediation sites..• Reserves are reviewed on a quarterly basis with input from engineering, legal, outside financial auditors and internal financial.controllers..• Reserves are based on when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and can be reasonably estimated..• Reserves are reviewed periodically with senior management..• For more information on 3M’s environmental matters, please see “Legal Proceedings” in 3M’s Form 10-K for the year ending.December 31, 2010..Remediation Spending.• Average 3M spending since inception of Superfund has been about $13 million/year (range of $3 million to $30 million per.year)..• All 3M international manufacturing sites have been assessed for potential remediation and further investigations are underway.at several locations..Remediation Success Factors.Key program characteristics that minimize liabilities of remediation sites.• Centralized management to ensure coordinated strategies and optimization..• Established business process for all aspects of remediation..• Effective use of risk-assessment and sound science-based evidence to influence remedy selection and drive effective.outcomes..• Development and maintenance of cooperative relationships with all key stakeholders..• Effective use of innovative remediation technology to achieve effective cleanup..IV. Product Environmental Management.Environmental Solutions.3M’s commitment to sustainability and environmental protection goes beyond minimizing our impacts to the environment from our.operations. 3M provides product solutions that help our customers minimize their own environmental impacts. For more than a century,.3M's success has come from developing innovative technologies that are the foundation for products that make people's lives easier.and better. Our inspiration comes from listening to customers and creating new products and solutions for the challenges and.opportunities they face..30.Download copies of 3M’s Environmental Solutions catalogs that feature these products:.http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3M-Sustainability/Global/Resources/Downloads/.Products included in 3M's Environmental Solutions catalog meet one or more of the criteria below..Products that help 3M customers to reduce their environmental footprint.• Products that reduce air pollution.• Products that reduce customer energy use &/or greenhouse gas emissions.• Products that reduce customer waste (via reuse, recyclability, & compostability).• Products that reduce customer water use or pollution.• Products that prevent the disturbance of environmentally sensitive areas or clean up industrial pollution.• Improve fuel economy in vehicles (i.e via light weighting).Products that are manufactured with a reduced footprint.• Products manufactured using a low/no solvent (VOC) process.• Products that are made with recycled content, renewable resources, or using 3rd party certified materials.• Products that do not contain materials of concern typically found in competitive products.• Products with less of a carbon footprint than other similar solutions using the same methodology.Driving Growth through New Products with Environmental Advantages.One of the metrics that 3M tracks to monitor business growth is its new product vitality index or NPVI. NPVI is the percent of sales.attributed to new products. It is calculated by taking the net sales of products introduced within the past five years and dividing that by.total product sales. In 2007, 3M’s NPVI was 25% and it has grown steadily over the past few years to 31% in 2010. In 2010, 3M set a.new goal as part of its 2015 sustainability goals to “further increase the sales of new products with environmental attributes.” Progress.towards this goal will be measured by looking at the % of sales in 3M’s NPVI that come from products with an environmental attribute..In 2011, 3M will be working to establish a base year measurement. Attributes across the products entire lifecycle will be considered.including:.• raw materials (i.e. recycled content),.• manufacturing (i.e. products that are manufactured using no/low solvent processes when completive products rely on.solvent based manufacturing processes),.• product design (i.e. products that are designed to be reusable when completive products can only be used once),.• customer use (i.e. products that reduce energy use for the customer), and.• disposal (i.e. products that can be recycled)..Product Life Cycle Management.3M is committed to managing the life cycle impacts of our products and developing solutions that can help our customers address their.environmental challenges..3M’s Life Cycle Management (LCM) Program places a focus on products throughout their entire life cycle, from manufacturing through.customer use and disposal. In 2001, 3M adopted a new Life Cycle Management Policy requiring all business units to conduct LCM.reviews for all new products and for existing products on a prioritized basis. With hundreds of new products introduced each year, 3M.has a continuous flow of opportunities to significantly add to our environmental, health and safety progress. Life Cycle Management.(LCM) is a formal part of 3M's new product introduction process worldwide..Cross-functional, new product introduction teams use a Life Cycle Management matrix to systematically and holistically address the.environmental, health and safety (EHS) opportunities and issues over each stage of their product's life. 3M's LCM process focuses on.the broader impact of products and processes over their entire life cycle:.• from development and manufacturing.• through distribution and customer use.• to disposal.31.Developing the Next Generation of Environmental Solutions.Through 3M’s new Community of Practice \"Solutions for a Better Environment,\" 3M’s research and development, technical, and.marketing staff are working to develop and commercialize new products that have environmental advantages in the manufacturing.stage and can help our customers address their environmental challenges..For example, 3M’s Corporate Research Laboratory has an initiative to identify and drive the utilization of renewable materials as.replacements for petroleum based polymers and monomers in 3M films, fibers, adhesives, molded products and more. The initiative is.expected to reduce the environmental footprint of 3M’s products and help ensure a more sustainable, cost-effective source of supply as.oil becomes scarcer and prices fluctuate..Recent News Regarding 3M’s Efforts to Help Our Customers Address Their Sustainability Challenges.• 3M and Its Customers Are Inventing a Better Tomorrow Through 3M’s Sustainable Technologies and Products.http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/3m/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&ndmConfigId=1000941&newsId=20110421006.264&newsLang=en.• 3M Invests in MAMA Sustainable Incubation AG.3M, through its New Ventures business, has entered into a strategic relationship with MAMA Sustainable Incubation AG – a.newly formed technology incubator specializing in the development of solutions for emerging green-markets such as renewable.energy, sustainable architecture and water treatment, based in Berlin, Germany.

Risk.reflects the potential for exposure and the hazards of the materials associated with the product over its life cycle, as well as the degree.of uncertainty and feasibility of controlling exposure. Opportunity addresses finding solutions to these issues. This proactive approach.by 3M to product risk characterization and management complements the American Chemistry Council’s (ACC) Global Chemical.Management Policy and the Responsible Care initiative. The chemical operation of 3M is a member of the ACC..Factors that may be considered when reviewing a product include exposure, hazard, uncertainty and market opportunity..• Exposure considerations may include the following: duration, concentration, distribution, frequency, pattern of product use,.location, demographics, impurities and byproducts, competency of user, and potential for abuse or misuse..• Consideration of potential marketing opportunities from a product’s reduced impact on the environment, health or safety may.include increased energy efficiency, reduced toxicity, reduced global warming potential, reduced energy use, recycle-ability,.and reduced worker health and/or safety concerns..• Hazard considerations may include the following: type of outcome, potential severity of outcome, uniqueness of hazards,.permanence of effect, and treat-ability..• Uncertainty considerations may include the following: completeness of information, knowledge of product, product history and.analogy to similar products, knowledge of customer, and knowledge of ultimate end-use..Enhancing Biodiversity.Partnering to Preserve Biodiversity.Enhancing and preserving biodiversity is an important part of 3M’s value of respecting our social and physical environment. 3M has.been working to preserve biodiversity both on our property and through our support of organizations like The Nature Conservancy and.Conservation International..32.3M Global Conservation Projects by Location.The Nature Conservancy.Over the last few years, the 3M Foundation has donated over $10 million to The Nature Conservancy to preserve habitat in the United.States, Australia, Brazil, Mexico and China. This partnership is helping to safeguard critical habitat and preserve biodiversity..At the same time, the partnership involves 3M employees and local residents. Besides increasing the amount of protected lands for.migration zones, endangered wildlife and rare indigenous plants, we are working together to improve visitor access and learning.opportunities for the public..In The United States:.In 2007, 3M donated $1.5 million to the Nature Conservancy’s Forest Legacy Partnership in Minnesota.

Liaise with municipality, state government and other partners to leverage 3M’s investment.In Mexico:.The forests of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula are of extraordinary ecological importance. More than 1.5 million acres of forest have been.set aside – with assistance from 3M and other donors – in protected areas such as the Calakmul Biosphere reserve. Still, important.34.forest lands are lost or threatened by illegal logging, conversion to agriculture, settlement, and unsustainable tourism..TNC’s goal for the region is to protect the forest while developing livelihoods for local people through sustainable forestry and tourism.activities..Project strategies:.1. Protect an additional 250,000 acres of forest by acquiring land, decreeing protected areas, and working with private and.community landowners.2. Develop sustainable forestry practices on 100,000 acres of private and community-owned forest lands.3. Promote and develop community-based, sustainable tourism.4. Reforest up to 10,000 acres of forest lands damaged by Hurricane Dean.5. Effectively manage forest protected areas by implementing wildfire controls, reducing illegal logging and deterring Poachers.In Australia:.In 2010, the 3M Foundation provided $500,000 to The Nature Conservancy for the Wild Australia project in the Northern Territories..The Nature Conservancy has joined with the Australian Government, in-country and global partners, and local indigenous communities.to protect Northern Australia’s unique wildlife and ecosystems. They are working with their partners to purchase Fish River Station in.Northern Australia, which will protect over 452,000 acres of highly biodiverse savanna woodlands and rainforest as well as important.floodplains for the Daly River. The diversity of habitat types and species of wildlife make Fish River a very high priority for conservation..Fish River is also an important opportunity to showcase how conservation organizations and indigenous communities can work.together to improve land management practices. Finally, Fish River is the key to a much larger protected area network in Australia’s.Northern Territories. This purchase will link together existing conservation areas and could lead to a protected area network covering.nearly two million acres of public and private lands south of the city of Darwin..Conservation International.3M worked with Conservation International to protect endangered wildlife and restore the threatened forests in China through a $3.million multi-year grant from the 3M Foundation. The Mountains of Southwest China are home to rare giant pandas, red pandas,.golden monkeys, elusive snow leopards, more than 685 bird species, as well as 12,000 species of trees and plants. Many of these.species are unique to this area that has become one of the world’s most critically threatened biodiversity hotspots..In 2007, 3M built upon these efforts by extending its donation and giving an additional $1 million to Conservation International’s Forest.Restoration for Climate, Community, and Biodiversity project. The extension will address water issues resulting from forest.degradation. Conservation International will:.• Assess and prioritize freshwater biodiversity conservation sites and develop a strategic plan for designing.payments for watershed services that would lead to a series of pilot demonstration projects to be implemented as a.second phase after this initial bridge grant;.• Design a financing mechanism to support Freshwater conservation - The China Freshwater Fund; and.• Raise the awareness of Chinese and international audiences of the importance of presenting China’s biodiversity..35.Acres Protected Through 3M’s Work with Conservation International.Acres Protected with 3M.Support (Acres supported Activity.Region in 3M reflected work over multiple.Project Location China Support years) (* indicates this is a future activity).Sichuan Reforestation - Planting finished in.Reforestation on Degraded Lands Province 5,560 2008.Reforestation in Degraded Habitats of Sichuan Reforestation - Planting finished in.Wang Lang Nature Reserve Province 280 2007.Small scale forest restoration project Yunnan Reforestation - Planting finished in.on degraded lands in Tengchong Province 1,175 2007.Multi-purpose Reforestation on Yunnan Reforestation - Planting scheduled.Degraded Lands in Longyang Province $4,000,000 3,315 to begin in 2009.Enhancing Biodiversity at 3M Locations.The locations of some of 3M’s facilities share the same land with rare species of wildlife. In these locations and on other 3M properties.that support wildlife, the company works to enhance and protect the area’s natural habitat. For example, 3M’s Austin, Texas facility is.located within critical habitat for the endangered golden-cheeked warbler. The 3M Austin facility has worked hard to not only limit the.impact of its operations on the warbler, but to enhance the facility’s property to create a habitat that can be used by the warbler as well.as a number of other species found near the facility..3M Austin worked with The Wildlife Habitat Council, a nonprofit organization that helps corporations, conservation organizations and.individuals interested in protecting and enhancing wildlife habitat. The group makes recommendations in the form of a detailed wildlife.plan for the property that will allow wildlife to prosper. After programs are put in place, the Wildlife Habitat Council operates a Corporate.Habitat Certification/International Accreditation Program. This program recognizes exceptional habitat management and environmental.education programs at corporate sites..Currently, five 3M facilities have received certification from the habitat council including 3M’s Decatur, Alabama; Menomonie,.Wisconsin; Cottage Grove, Minnesota; and Greenville, South Carolina facilities and Corporate Center in Austin, Texas. Two additional.sites are in the process of seeking certification. In 2004, 3M’s Decatur, Alabama facility was awarded the Wildlife Habitat Council’s.Rookie of the Year Award from the WHC to honor “an outstanding newly certified wildlife habitat program.”.3M Austin Center’s Wildlife Habitat Program.The 3M Austin Center is an administrative and research facility in the city of Austin, Texas. 3M Austin Center contains a unique mix of.natural areas, landscape gardens and recreational areas for employee use. 3M Austin’s goals for the site are habitat enhancement,.employee and community involvement and environmental education..A number of actions have been adopted by 3M Austin to enhance its site, including establishment of no-mow zones around the.property, placement of decals on large plate-glass windows to deter bird collisions, creation of a 58-acre wildflower meadow with 128.different wildflower species and construction of a nature trail. Most recently, 3M Austin developed a water conservation program, a.monitoring and control program to deal with uncontrolled animal populations and a hummingbird garden..3M’s Cottage Grove, MN Facility Partners with Friends of the Mississippi River to Preserve and Restore Wildlife Habitat.3M’s Cottage Grove, MN facility is located on the banks of the Mississippi River. Since 2003, the facility has partnered with Friends of.the Mississippi River to preserve and restore natural habitat on the facility’s site. The facility has focused its efforts on preserving 30.acres of oak savanna and restoring an additional 170 acres surrounding the savanna..36.Volunteers from both 3M Cottage Grove and the Friends of the Mississippi River worked together to remove buckthorn and other.invasive plants, collect seeds, plant native plants, and perform a planned, controlled burn. Next year, the facility plans to continue its.restoration work and conduct a bird survey..Additional Information on 3M’s Work to Enhance Biodiversity:.• Brazil’s EDP Bandeirante Installs 3M ACCR for Line Upgrade to Avoid Building New Towers or Expanding Right-of-.Way:.http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/3m/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&ndmConfigId=1000940&newsId=20110105005.051&newsLang=en&vnsId=Brazil%E2%80%99s-EDP-Bandeirante-Installs-3M-ACCR-Line.Supply Chain Sustainability.As 3M sets a high bar for itself regarding environmental, health and safety, it expects the same from its suppliers. 3M has a formal.process as part of its Sourcing Policy that sets policies for its suppliers in the areas of environmental, health and safety, transportation,.labor and human resources and supplied materials. The policies apply to the selection and retention of all suppliers that provide goods.or services to 3M worldwide and establish a framework that 3M considers important to a safe and healthy workplace, to the.maintenance of fair and reasonable labor and human resource practices (including slavery and human trafficking), to the management.of manufacturing and distribution operations to minimize adverse impact to the environment, and to the content of materials supplied to.3M.. 3M expects suppliers to establish programs that are consistent with 3M’s Supply Chain Policies: EHS, Transportation,.Labor/Human Resources and Supplied Materials (Policies). 3M monitors sustainability matters associated with its supply chain,.including assessing performance with EHS, labor, transportation and material content expectations, pursuing relationships with small,.women-owned and minority-owned supplier businesses, and working with our customers to improve their sustainability efforts..Supplier EHS/Labor/Transportation Performance.Assessing supplier EHS and labor performance is complicated because of the complexity of supply chain matters associated with 3M’s.global operations. Because of the number and the multi-tiered nature of suppliers used, it is very difficult to ensure that significant.issues are being identified in a timely manner in our supply chain. Nevertheless, the continued implementation of our supplier.assessment process and the use of the mix of tools described below represent a significant effort to ensure that our suppliers are.abiding by the 3M expectations placed upon them. 3M estimates that its uses approximately 15,000 suppliers worldwide to assist in the.manufacture of goods..The following steps are included as elements of the 3M program to assess supplier conformance with the Policies:.1. The suppliers may be ranked using a prioritization matrix tool..2. The “prioritized” suppliers may be asked to and/or complete a self-assessment survey..3. An on-site audit may be conducted..4. If any deficiencies are identified during an on-site visit, a correction plan is put into place and a follow-up audit and/or.communication with the supplier is conducted..The 3M program integrates several assessment tools:.1. Prioritization matrix: This matrix tool takes into account a combination of factors, including the country where the supplier.operation is located, the type of supplier manufacturing operations, and the total dollar spent by 3M with the supplier..2. Supplier Assessment Surveys (SAS): The 3M questions and supplier answers are intended to provide a framework for.understanding the supplier’s programs and the importance the supplier places on these issues. The objective of the questions.is to determine whether the supplier generally meets the intent of the Policies..3. Audit process: To assure compliance with the Policies, a supplier audit checklist has been developed that contains audit.guidance on EHS management, general working conditions, specific working hazards, health and safety inspections, EHS.training, emergency response, transportation management, hazardous materials management, HR management and.compliance, employment practices, child labor, forced labor, discrimination and freedom of association. Audits are conducted.by 3M staff in most cases, but 3M may use third party audit firms as necessary. As well, customer or general public concerns.can be brought to 3M’s attention via phone or website (http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/About/3M/)..37.More than a thousand self-assessments and/or on-site audits of suppliers have been conducted in China, Taiwan, India, Korea, Brazil,.Mexico, Russia and Turkey over the past 5 years. While the majority of companies are found to meet 3M’s requirements, others are.provided input on actions that 3M expects to be taken to retain 3M business. Most companies are willing to work with 3M to improve.their processes and pass 3M’s requalification assessment after the corrective work is completed..Overall, the most common EHS findings have been insufficient machine guarding and low use of personal protective equipment..Similarly in the labor standards area, common findings include weak human resource documentation and overtime pay controls. Once.identified, most suppliers work very quickly to address any findings. In increasingly rare situations, companies have been determined.to be either unwilling or unable to improve their efforts in a timely fashion and have been de-listed or terminated by 3M. More typically,.3M policies and guidance in meeting them have helped potential suppliers raise their capability to become a 3M supplier. In addition to.existing suppliers many potential suppliers have been assessed using one of the 3M-developed tools, and several business groups.within the U.S. have incorporated EHS and labor considerations into their life cycle management reviews and have performed.assessments of their key suppliers..Supplier Development.3M actively engages suppliers in sustainability by communicating 3M’s sustainability expectations through clauses in contracts, links to.3M’s website and in direct business meetings. Improving energy efficiency and reducing waste are common agenda items. 3M is.involved with the US “Energy Star” program and has promoted the pledge program with key suppliers, and has hosted a best practice.seminar..Sourcing Training.Sourcing staff with responsibility for supplier relationships receive training on all aspects of supply chain sustainability, including slavery.and human trafficking prohibitions. In the past year there has been additional focus on understanding and managing environmental.preference factors in supplier selection..Supplier Diversity.Sourcing from diverse businesses that are small, minority-owned, woman-owned, small veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-.owned, and certified HUBZone is an important part of the way 3M purchases goods and services. These businesses comprise a vital,.growing segment of our economy and great potential for helping 3M obtain best value, innovation, growth, and diverse goods and.services. In addition small and diverse businesses provide economic and social energy to the communities in which we operate. 3M is.committed to aggressively and proactively identifying diverse business sources for all goods and services purchased, and works to.solicit capable firms and execute orders and contracts with those firms as required to support 3M business needs. Buyers within 3M.have access to various supplier diversity directories and resources to assist in identifying sources..When awarding business to suppliers, 3M considers the community impact of the sales footprint to the supplier that the business.represents. Changing demand patterns may have a significant impact on the supplier if 3M’s footprint is too high. 3M attempts to limit.the business volume to prevent excessive impacts to local communities..3M’s Partners and Suppliers website is the gateway to learn more about 3M’s supplier requirements and our diversity initiative:.http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Partners/Suppliers/.Supplier Information.3M has established product responsibility databases and tools to better manage environmental and health and safety information.related to 3M products. Extensive efforts have been undertaken with 3M suppliers to gather raw material composition information and.other environmental, health and safety information to provide to customers of 3M products and/or to ensure compliance with the.European Union Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive, the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals.(REACH) legislation in the EU, and various other chemical content, material use and packaging laws and regulations around the globe..Solutions for our Customers.3M offers our customers a portfolio of products to help them reduce their impact on the environment. In 2007, 3M launched a new.catalog showcasing 3M products designed to address environmental challenges in the following markets: cleaning and maintenance,.construction and industrial production, communications, office supplies, transportation, and health care. The items in the catalog all.38.demonstrate some type of positive environmental attribute beyond the industry norm, such as recyclable, biodegradable, containing no.heavy metals, and/or do not bio-accumulate. The Environmental Solutions Catalog can be downloaded at www.3M.com/EnvSolutions..In addition 3M has worked to e-enable many business e-commerce processes. In the US, 92 percent of purchase order invoices are.received electronically and 70 percent of payments are paperless. This has eliminated tens of thousands of paper documents per year..In 2009, a third party benchmark identified 3M’s e-commerce results well above other US best in class companies..Continuing our Progress.3M is an innovative company and will continue to identify, to improve, and to work with its’ supply chain partners to advance.sustainability efforts..3M’s Standards for Suppliers: Environmental, Health and Safety, Transportation, and Labor/Human.Resources (PDF, 28KB): See Downloads (http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3M-.Sustainability/Global/Resources/Downloads/).Stakeholders and Partnerships.Stakeholder Interaction.Meeting Needs and Keeping in Touch.In our drive to sustainability, we also strive to maintain a continuous and open dialogue with the community, shareholders, employees,.retirees and other interested parties about past achievements and future sustainability goals. The interplay of the environmental outlook,.societal needs and market opportunities brings about continuous reassessment and sustainable development progress. And we remain.committed to providing investors with an attractive return through sustained, high-quality growth..We share information on our efforts and growth through a number of online and printed materials, in open houses and plant tours..Community newsletters and the sharing of information with local news media that pass it on to the public as news stories also are used..Engaging Stakeholders.3M is a diverse company, producing thousands of products and operating in over 65 countries. These products are made in large and.small communities all over the globe. 3M recognizes the link community stakeholders have to its business. 3M strives to maintain a.continuous and open dialogue with the community, shareholders, employees, customers, community members, retirees and other.interested parties about the company’s past activities and future sustainability goals. These discussions help the company keep.abreast of emerging issues and shape its response. 3M develops engagement plans and communicates with its wide variety of.stakeholders at the corporate and local or regional level. 3M endeavors to meet stakeholder expectations at a global level on global.issues, but the majority of stakeholder interaction occurs at the place where 3M’s activities touch our stakeholders..Local and Regional Stakeholder Engagement.In 2005, 3M developed a new, more systematic, local and regional stakeholder engagement process. This new method was developed.using Six Sigma tools and is a formalized process to help facilities establish a consistent, documented and proactive system to drive.engagement. The new system is a component of 3M’s Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Management System and requires 3M.manufacturing facilities to complete and document the following activities:.• Identify critical stakeholders,.• Analyze and evaluate their current stakeholder engagement activities,.• Identify communications opportunities,.• Develop and implement a stakeholder engagement plan, and.• Measure the plan’s effectiveness..While each facility will develop a stakeholder engagement process using the same 3M developed system, the engagement tactics.employed by each location are developed to meet the needs of local stakeholders. 3M locations employ a wide range of methods to.consult with our stakeholders, such as:.39.• Neighbor meetings..• Employee meetings..• Employee surveys..• Community newsletters..• Facility open houses and tours..• Active participation in local civic groups..• Participation in community organizations like chambers of commerce or task forces around issues such as economic.development and job creation..• Facility Web sites..These consultations yield insight for 3M's locations and the corporation as a whole concerning issues such as our environmental.performance, management systems, and community interaction. The frequency of these consultations varies according to the.stakeholder and the issues at hand. For instance, a 3M location may meet with employee groups monthly and with community leaders.and regulators quarterly. The feedback we receive from our stakeholders is invaluable in shaping our sustainability strategies and helps.to ensure that we continue to operate in a way that is sensitive to their needs..In 2010, 3M established a goal as part of our 2015 sustainability goals to challenge our locations to expand their current plans to also.include community volunteerism, tracking of local community giving and its impact on key priorities, and formal stakeholder surveys..Corporate Stakeholder Engagement.As a complement to its local and regional engagement process, 3M also analyzes and creates plans concerning its corporate.stakeholder engagement around sustainability programs and issues. This corporate process follows AccountAbility’s AA1000.Stakeholder Engagement Standard and was developed using tools from “From Words to Action; The Stakeholder Engagement Manual.Volume 2: The Practitioner’s Handbook on Stakeholder Engagement” created by AccountAbility, the United Nations Environment.Programme, and Stakeholder Research Associates..Stakeholder Categories Engaged by 3M:.Employees, Retirees, Customers, Peer Companies, Academics / Universities, Students, Competitors, Communities, Governments,.Investors, Suppliers, & Nongovernmental.Organizations.3M’s corporate sustainability stakeholder engagement process involves the following steps taken from The Stakeholder Engagement.Manual:.1. Mapping 3M’s Stakeholders. This step includes identifying 3M’s key global stakeholder categories and subgroups for each.category. As an example, “3M Employees” are a key stakeholder category and “exempt employees,” “non-exempt.employees,” “production employees,” and “senior management” are examples of some of the 3M Employees’ sub groups..2. Identifying Engagement Issues. Key sustainability issues for 3M and our stakeholders are documented..3. Documentation of Engagement Objectives and Issues.4. Assessing Engagement Issue Materiality. Issues are ranked as being of high, medium, or low materiality using.AccountAbility’s five-part materiality test. This test examines issues in the following five areas: “Issues that have direct short-.term financial impacts.” “Issues where the company has agreed policy statements of a strategic nature,” “Issues that.comparable organizations consider within their sphere of materiality,” “Issues that your stakeholders consider important.enough to act on (now or in the future),” and “Issues which are considered social norms.1”.5. Assessing 3M’s Stakeholders’ Perceptions of the Issues Identified. Each issue was ranked as a high (9), medium (3), low (1),.or no (0) interest level for each of the identified stakeholder categories..6. Engagement planning around material sustainability issues with high stakeholder interest. The combined interest of our.stakeholders and issue materiality to 3M was used to identify a sub-set of key engagement issues. Again, using the tools.1.From Words to Action; The Stakeholder Engagement Manual Volume 2: The Practitioner’s Handbook on Stakeholder Engagement,.First Edition October 2005, AccountAbility, the United Nations Environment Programme, and Stakeholder Research Associates.40.outlined in The Stakeholder Engagement Manual, 3M created a plan which outlines the engagement strategy and includes.items, such as the following, for each key issue:.• Stakeholder expectation.• 3M goals / objectives.• Recommended engagement method & channel.• Actions, abilities, resources needed for engagement.3M developed its current stakeholder engagement plan in 2010/11. A revised plan will be developed in 2013/14..Partnerships.Partnerships are an important part of 3M’s sustainability strategy. 3M partners with a variety of organizations to help provide us with a.diverse set of viewpoints on sustainability, a better understanding of the positions of our stakeholders, and a mechanism to learn from.the successes and failures of our peers..While 3M partners with thousands of organizations, some examples are listed below:.National, International and Local Governments.• Federal Office of Health (Switzerland).• Federal Office of Social Insurance (Switzerland).• United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA) Clean Air Act Advisory Committee (charter member).• U.S. EPA’s Green Power Partnership.• U.S. EPA & United States Department of Energy (DOE)’s Energy Star Program.Community, Academic, and Nongovernmental Organizations.• Air & Waste Management Association.• Alliance to Save Energy.• Clinton Climate Initiative.• Friends of the Mississippi River.• Harvard Medical School, Center for Health and the Global Environment.• Junior Achievement - US and Junior Achievement - Switzerland.• Minneapolis Institute of Arts.• Minnesota Environmental Initiative.• National League Against the Cancer.• The Nature Conservancy.• The Science Museum of Minnesota.• Hands on Twin Cities.• St. Paul Public Schools.• The United Way.• WWF Italia.Business Associations.• CSR Netherlands (MVO Nederland).• Orée.• The Global Environmental Management Initiative.• The World Business Council for Sustainable Development.• National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association.• U.S. Chamber of Commerce.• Zürich Chamber of Commerce.• Fuel Cell Council.• Federchimica.41.Partnership Examples.Restoring Threatened Forests in China.The mountains of southwest China are home to rare giant pandas, red pandas, golden monkeys, elusive snow leopards, more than.685 bird species, as well as 12,000 species of trees and plants. Many of these species are unique to this area, which has become one.of the world's most critically threatened biodiversity hotspots.

The project emphasizes 3M’s worldwide long-standing commitment to reducing the.company's environmental footprint. The Sustainable Energy Europe Campaign was launched in 2005 by the European Union to.promote sustainable energy policy. It seeks to boost visibility of sustainable energy technologies at the European level and facilitate a.more efficient spread of best practices and know-how. Since 2005, 904 projects representing public and private stakeholders, local,.regional and national authorities, industry, energy agencies, associations and civil society have been endorsed as Official Partners..Putting Emission Reduction Credits to Good Use.Under U.S. environmental laws, 3M has been able to earn emission reduction credits for reducing its air emissions beyond.environmental regulatory requirements. In most cases where 3M has done this, we either sold these credits and contributed the profits.to environmentally beneficial projects, or contributed the emission-reduction credits themselves to state and local governments for air-.quality improvements..Over the past five years, proceeds from the sale of emission reduction credits were donated to several nonprofits, primarily in the state.of Minnesota, for environmental programming. Grants were made to:.• Belwin Nature Center -- Environmental Education Dock Replacement Project.• Deep Portage Learning Center -- Birds, climate and teacher education program..• Dodge Nature Center -- Sustainable energy education project..• Eagle Bluff Environmental Learning Center -- Climate of change education program..• EcoEducation -- Urban Environmental Education Initiative.• Harvard University -- Center for Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard Medical School..• Long Lake Conservation Foundation -- Biodiversity curriculum project..• University of Minnesota Raptor Center -- Raptor learning adventures exhibit development..• Wolf Ridge Environmental Learning Center -- Human connection to nature's timing curriculum development..Community Involvement.Investing in Community Innovation.Because of 3M's business success, we are able to invest in innovative community programs that help make the future brighter for.everyone. 3M employees and retirees also give generously of their time and professional talents to local organizations and agencies..3M Foundation Board and Corporate Contributions Committee.Our global Community Giving Program is decentralized with 3M subsidiaries in each country developing and administering a program.that is consistent with the local culture, community needs and environment in which we operate..42.Example: Community Giving in the United States.In the United States, the 3M Foundation Board of Directors and Corporate Contributions Committee, comprised of 3M.employees, defines the vision for our program that brings corporate financial and volunteer resources together to reflect who.we are as a company and our philanthropic relationship with communities in which 3M operates. To help establish our giving.focus and evaluate funding requests, 3M depends on the insight of employee advisory committees.

This report was published in 2011 and contains data collected over 2010.(from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010). The most recent previous Sustainability Report was published in 2010 and.contained data relating to 3M’s operations in 2009. 3M’s report is a global report including all 3M-owned manufacturing locations and.leased facilities worldwide, including joint ventures and partially owned subsidiaries where we have operational control. 3M reports.62.information on these sources on an “operational control basis”—reporting the full data on the entities when the 3M possess operational.control. 3M does not include outsourced manufacturing locations in its Sustainability Report. The social metrics included in the report.relate to all 3M employees. All data discussed in the report is global data. However, in some instances, data is not available on a global.basis. When this is the case, the scope of the data is identified within the report content..Prior to 2010, 3M’s sustainability report was a fully integrated web site. Therefore, copies of 3M’s sustainability report earlier than 2009.are not available..Base Year & Other Adjustment.3M generally does not adjust its base year data to reflect changes in 3M’s organizational structure when tracking environmental metrics..As a result, 3M sets environmental targets that are normalized or indexed to production (i.e. lbs emitted / dollar sales) to ensure the.environmental progress we report publicly is not unduly influenced by changes to our organizational structure. However, in the case of.our greenhouse gas emissions data, 3M follows the World Resource Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable.Development’s GHG Protocol. Consequently, we readjust our greenhouse gas emissions base year data in the case of business.acquisitions and divestitures..3M adjusts base year data when tracking social metrics..In every case, 3M adjusts base year and other years’ data if data-collection methods change or data errors are identified. Any.significant changes in the measurement methods and /or data values applied to key environmental and social information from.previous years are documented within the report’s content. Significant changes are defined by 3M’s sustainability report as changes.greater than 3% of the original data point. In the case of minor changes (changes less than 3% of the original data point), the data point.is modified to reflect the minor changes in measurement method or data..In addition, in 2005, 3M adopted a new definition of waste to drive the company’s waste reduction efforts towards more sustainable.solutions, such as pollution prevention. The new definition considered waste that was recycled to be counted as waste as opposed to.be considered neutral in waste accounting. In 2011, 3M returned to a more conventional definition of waste which considered recycling.as neutral (contributing neither toward total waste or toward good output). Waste data is reported in this report using both definitions..When total waste is discussed in general, a conventional recycling neutral definition is used. When progress towards 3M’s waste.reduction goal under the Environmental Targets 2010 program is referenced, waste figures include recycling. Please see the Reducing.Waste and Corporate Environmental Goals sections of the report for more information on this change..In 2007, data entry errors were identified at four 3M manufacturing facilities through internal and external auditing. The correction of.these errors led to a 5.8% increase in 3M’s 2006 reported VOC emissions and a 1.2% increase in the company’s reported waste.generation. In 2009, there were no significant changes to 3M’s sustainability data..3M’s annual report and investor relations web site documents any changes to financial data. Several of 3M’s environmental goals are.normalized per dollar sales. 3M does not adjust sales data for inflation..Report Profile.3M applies the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) reporting principles whenever possible. Any deviations from these principles are.documented in the GRI Content Index..Further Information.Further information concerning 3M’s sustainability reporting can be obtained by contacting 3M Corporate Public Relations at 1-888-3M.HELPS(1-888-364-3577) or through the contact us function on www.mmm.com..3M’s Sustainability Report Data Collection.All of the data in this report has been reviewed for accuracy and completeness, including the reliability of the.systems used to obtain the data by corporate staff professionals in each area. Corporate staff also have verified the implementation of.63.policies and management systems through audits and self-reporting systems..Environmental, Health and Safety Data.The environmental, health and safety data in this report relate to releases to the environment, safety performance, management.systems implementation and regulatory compliance. Data collection systems are in place in our facilities to track and collect.environmental and safety data..Our manufacturing facilities have an environmental management system in place. Environmental data measurement, recording and.reporting are included in these systems. Third-party audits of the systems are conducted on the environmental management systems.at the ISO 14001 certified facilities plus there is an internal EHS auditing function that conducts regular environmental audits. A global.environmental incidents database tracks agency notices, exceedances, spills and fines..There is a global database for tracking the reporting of injuries and illnesses. Reporting and record keeping requirements are part of.our Global Safety and Health Plan. There is both a facility self-assessment requirement for the EHS Management System (with.reporting on the EHS Scorecard) and a formal, internal Global Safety and Health Plan audit process to help ensure compliance with.these requirements..Social Data.The data related to social and community programs has been derived from various databases in the Human Resources and.Community Affairs areas. This data has been reviewed and verified by the department responsible for maintaining the databases..Defining Sustainability Report Content.3M’s Sustainability Report and sustainability web site are the company’s primary mechanism to communicate its sustainability policies,.programs, and performance to its stakeholders. Therefore, defining their scope and content is extremely important. 3M uses the.following key information sources to help define its report’s content:.1. 3M’s sustainability issue materiality determination.2. 3M’s stakeholder interest evaluation.3. Direct feedback from users of previous sustainability reports.4. The Global Reporting Initiative sustainability reporting guidelines.3M’s Sustainability Issue Materiality and Stakeholder Interest Determination.As part of 3M’s corporate stakeholder engagement process, the company evaluates and documents the materiality of and stakeholder.interest in key sustainability issues. 3M uses From Words to Action; The Stakeholder Engagement Manual Volume 2: The Practitioner’s.Handbook on Stakeholder Engagement’s five part materiality test to evaluate the materiality of sustainability issues to 3M. This system.ranks issues as being of high, medium, or low materiality for an entity by scoring the issue based on the following five criteria:.• “Issues that have direct short-term financial impacts.”.• “Issues where the company has agreed policy statements of a strategic nature,”.• “Issues that comparable organizations consider within their sphere of materiality,”.• “Issues that your stakeholders consider important enough to act on (now or in the future),”.• “Issues which are considered social norms.”.Issues that score an average high score across each of the five areas are determined to be highly material for the company. As an.example, when 3M last completed its stakeholder engagement planning, greenhouse gas / climate change management and.disclosure of business conduct policies and procedures both score as “highly material” to 3M. In the case of greenhouse gas / climate.change management, the issue was scored as “highly material” regarding each of the 5 criteria. In the case of disclosure of business.conduct policies and procedures, the issue was scored as being “highly material” overall for the corporation and for each of the sub-.criteria except “Issues that have direct short-term financial impacts” where it was scored as having “medium materiality.”.Stakeholder interest is determined by aggregating each of 3M’s stakeholder groups relative interest around a particular sustainability.issue. If a stakeholder group has a high interest in an issue it is scored as a “9”, if that group has a fair level of interest the issue is.scored as a “3,” if the group has low, but some, interest in the issue the issue receives a score of “1”, and if the group has no defined.interest in the area it is scored as “0.” Each stakeholder groups’ scores on a particular issue are aggregated to yield the issue’s overall.64.score which is used to rank relative interest by 3M’s stakeholders in various sustainability issues. Both the materiality determination.and relative stakeholder interest evaluation are important factors in determining what issues are included and their depth of coverage in.3M’s Sustainability Report..3M developed its current stakeholder engagement plan in 2010/11. 3M revisits is plan every 3-4 years. Arevised plan will be.developed in 2013/14..Feedback from Users of 3M’s Sustainability Reports.3M also draws on direct feedback from users of its Sustainability Report / website to determine future content..3M’s website includes a pop-up survey that is distributed to a random selection of site visitors. The survey data helps 3M understand.how the site is meeting visitors’ expectations in terms of usability and content..In addition, in 2007, 3M performed a targeted survey of sustainability site users. Over 125 individuals representing 3M employees,.customers, peer companies, non-governmental organizations, citizens from the communities where 3M operates, students, academics,.and governmental organizations were asked to complete an on-line survey to evaluate 3M’s report and offer suggestions for.improvement. In addition, 3M performed in-depth phone interviews of an additional 12 individuals from the same stakeholder groups..The feedback from the surveys and interviews was used to redesign the sustainability web site to make it more user friendly and to.better align the site’s content with site user’s interests. Some of the key suggestions included:.• Include more information greenhouse gas management and strategy.• Include more information about 3M products.• Include more information on 3M’s stakeholder engagement.• Include more information on 3M’s sustainability strategies.• Performance indicators should be aggregated and easier to use.The Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.3M uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines to develop its Sustainability Report..In 2011, 3M developed its report to encompass “C+ level” G3 reporting.
