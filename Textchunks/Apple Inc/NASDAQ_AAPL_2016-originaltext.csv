Our work is led by Lisa Jackson , Apple ’ s Vice President of Environment , Policy and Social Initiatives , reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook . The Office of Environment , Policy and Social Initiatives works with teams across Apple to set strategy , engage stakeholders , and com-municate progress . Our integrated approach means that decisions about Apple values , including environment , are reviewed and sup-ported at the highest levels of the company . Innovation is at the heart of everything we do at Apple , and that extends to our commitment to protecting the natural environment for the future . We believe our planet deserves our best thinking . So we ’ re constantly striving to find or invent solutions to important environmental challenges—whether it ’ s a line of robots that disassembles iPhone 6 for recycling , a vast network of solar panels on urban roof - tops to power our facilities in Singapore , or new product designs that eliminate harmful substances like beryllium .

Apple ’ s 2016 Environmental Responsibility Report , covering fiscal year 2015 , is our ninth annual update , highlighting the progress we ’ ve made and the places we ’ re working hard to improve . Focus and simplify is one of our mantras . So , after deep reflection , data analysis , and conversations with stakeholders , we set three priorities where we believe Apple can make the most impact : • Reduce our impact on climate change by using renewable energy sources and driving energy efficiency in our products and facilities . • Conserve precious resources so we all can thrive . • Pioneer the use of safer materials in our products and processes . • This report details how we are approaching each of these priorities , and highlights some of our key accomplishments to date . For starters , as of January 2016 , we ’ re sourcing or generating enough renewable energy to cover 93 percent of the electricity we use at our facilities worldwide . In fact , Apple is now 100 percent renewable in 23 countries , including China , Germany , Singapore , and the United States . We ’ re also 100 percent renewable at every one of our data centers . So whenever you send an iMessage , download a song from iTunes , or ask Siri a question , the energy Apple uses doesn ’ t contribute to climate change . In the past five years , we have reduced the carbon footprint of Apple facilities by 64 percent thanks to our clean energy use , avoiding over 1 million metric tons of carbon emissions . We ’ re working hard to reach 100 percent renewable energy for all of our facilities worldwide , and help our suppliers in China and everywhere around the world make the same transition to clean energy as we have . 4 Environmental Responsibility Report | 2016 Progress Report , Covering FY2015We ’ re as"

In 2015 , we diverted more than 89 million pounds of e-waste from landfills . And more recently , we introduced Liam , a line of robots that can disassemble an iPhone every 1 1 seconds and sort its high-quality components so they can be recycled , reducing the need to mine those resources from the earth . It ’ s an experiment in recycling technology , and we hope this kind of thinking will inspire others . We ’ re also making strides in our efforts to preserve working forests , which , when managed properly , can be important renewable resources . Last year , over 99 percent of our product packaging came from paper that was recycled or sourced from sustainably managed forests . We ’ re also partnering with The Conservation Fund to protect sustain - ably managed working forests in the United States , and with World Wildlife Fund to transition forests into responsible management in China . For years , we ’ ve led the electronics industry in removing toxins such as arsenic , PVC , brominated flame retardants , and phthalates from our products . Many toxins are restricted not only in the products themselves but also in the manufacturing process , because we are committed to the people who make , use , and recycle our products . This past year , we started a Full Material Disclosure program , which will show us the chemical composition of every material in every component of our products so we can understand their effect on our health and on the environment .

We are committed to increasing openness in our work and welcome you to join us on our journey . In February 2016 , we issued a US $ 1.5 billion green bond , the first ever by a U.S. tech company . The green bond proceeds are dedicated to financing environmental projects—because environmental respon - sibilit y is core to our business.1 . 5 billion 5 Environmental Responsibility Report | 2016 Progress Report , Covering FY2015 Climate Change The Singapore solar project is the first distributed utility-scale installation in the country and is spread over hundreds of rooftops . Climate change is real . So is what we ’ re doing about it . In 2015 , 93 percent of our energy came from renewable sources . And we ’ re constantly looking for ways to get to 100 percent . In Singapore , we ’ re powering our facilities with a 32-megawatt solar project spread over more than 800 rooftops . In China , we ’ re adding 170 megawatts of solar to begin offsetting the energy used to make our products . And our data centers around the world run on 100 percent clean energy and power billions of iMessages , answers from Siri , and song downloads from iTunes .

Partnering with suppliers to reduce emissions . The electricity we use in our supply chain to process raw materials , make parts , and assemble our products is the single biggest source of our carbon footprint—over 60 percent of our manufacturing emissions . So in 2015 , we created programs to help our partners around the world reduce their energy use , power their facilities with clean energy , and build high-quality renewable energy projects . We started engaging directly with suppliers in 2015 to assess their energy use with detailed energy audits . We work together to find ways to reduce energy use—replacing outdated or inefficient heating , cooling , and lighting systems ; repairing compressed air leaks ; and recovering waste heat . T hrough the process , we aim to promote continual improvement ; build technical capabilities ; and increase awareness of the environmental and financial benefits of energy efficiency . We conducted 13 energy audits at supplier facilities in China , Taiwan , and Japan last year , identifying more than US $ 32 million in annual savings opportunities . This corresponds to reductions of approximately 224 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and 269,000 million British thermal units of fuel . From these identified improvements , suppliers have already reduced over 18 million kilowatt-hours of electricity , avoiding 13,800 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents ( CO 2e ) .1 We are continuing to expand the program for even greater impact . Our efforts go beyond energy efficiency to spur the development and procurement of renewable energy within our supply chain . We ’ re building 200 megawatts of solar in China , starting with a 170-megawatt solar project in Inner Mongolia , to begin offsetting our manufacturing emissions . We ’ re also working with suppliers to install more than 4 gigawatts of new clean energy worldwide , including 2 gigawatts in China by 2020 . Our 4 gigawatts of clean energy projects will avoid over 30 million metric tons of carbon pollution , equivalent to taking over 6 million cars off the road for one year.2 7 Environmental Responsibility Report | 2016 Progress Report , Covering FY2015The transition to renewable energy can be highly technical .

It often requires compli - cated deal structures across many regions with their own regulatory requirements . Apple is experienced in sourcing and building renewable energy—quickly and at a high standard across the globe—so we are working with our suppliers to help them overcome challenges . We know that , with some hard work and collaboration , suppliers can reduce their own carbon footprint through the development of high-quality and cost-effective renewable energy projects . As part of Apple ’ s industry-leading program , over the next two years , Foxconn will install 400 megawatts of solar to cover the energy use of its iPhone final production facility in Zhengzhou , China . Lowering our carbon emissions by focusing on aluminum . We sell millions and millions of phones . So making even small adjustments to the production of iPhone can have a big impact . We discovered that changing how we make the aluminum enclosure could lower our carbon footprint . We prioritized aluminum that was smelted using hydroelectricity rather than fossil fuels . And we reengineered our manufacturing process to reincorporate the scrap aluminum . As a result , we cut the carbon footprint associated with the aluminum enclosure of iPhone 6s in half compared with the previous generation . And we ’ re looking for new ways to use more carbon-efficient aluminum across all of our products . iPhone 6 iPhone 6s The carbon footprint of iPhone 6s aluminum enclosure is half that of the previous generation . 8 Environmental Responsibility Report | 2016 Progress Report , Covering FY2015Product Usage Your energy use is our energy use .

All of the energy it takes to run your device—from the time you open the box to the day it ’ s recycled—is added to our carbon footprint . We even include the energy it takes to charge your device , which usually comes from carbon-intensive sources such as coal or gas . So we ’ re always developing new ways to make our products as efficient as possible . For example , the Mac operating system puts the hard drive to sleep and runs processors in an ultralow power mode when you ’ re not hard at work . It can even save energy when the screen is static and between keystrokes when you type . MacBook Air consumes 52 percent less energy than the original model . Mac mini consumes 40 percent less power when idle than the previous generation . Apple TV consumes 90 percent less energy than the first generation . And you can charge your iPhone 6s once a day for a year for only 53 cents.3 In fact , since 2008 we ’ ve reduced the average total power consumed by Apple products by 64 percent , bringing down our overall carbon footprint and your electricity bill at the same time.4 0.5 w Power consumed by the MacBook in sleep mode , the lowest of any Mac . 7x Mac mini exceeds ENERGY STAR requirements by up to seven times . 97 % The power used by the iMac in sleep mode was reduced 97 percent compared with the first-generation iMac .

We ’ re proud to say that all those tasks are handled by Apple data servers running on 100 percent renewable energy . When we need a little extra juice , we work with third-party data centers . Even though we don ’ t own them , and share them with other companies , we still include them in our renewable energy goals . So we ’ re working with these providers to get them to 100 percent renewable energy , too . All told , in 2014 our data centers avoided 150,000 metric tons of CO 2e emissions . And in 2015 , that number grew to 187 ,000 metric tons . Facilities We use the power of the sun , wind , and water to power our lights , servers , and coffeemakers . We ’ re constantly finding ways to be more energy efficient and working toward our goal of covering 100 percent of the electricity use of our global facilities—data centers , corpo - rate offices , and more than 475 Apple Retail Stores—with 100 percent renewable energy . As of January 2016 , we ’ re at 93 percent worldwide . And in 23 countries , including the United States , the United Kingdom , China , and Australia , we ’ re at 100 percent . For exam - ple , we connected 40 megawatts of new solar energy to China ’ s national grid , producing more than enough electricity for all of Apple ’ s offices and retail stores in China .

It was removed from operation in fiscal year 2015 and is not shown on this chart . The cleanest energy is the energy you never use . We ’ ve made energy efficiency a priority across all of our facilities , seeing energy savings of 25 percent or more in the buildings assessed . We have completed extensive energy efficiency projects at our corporate headquarters in Cupertino , California , and the surrounding Santa Clara Valley , where we operate more than 100 buildings , some of which we ’ ve called home for more than 20 years . As buildings age , and as our working needs have changed , we ’ ve undertaken aggressive programs to improve the comfort and function of our facilities , all the while ensuring they require less energy . Improvements made during the past five years now save over 39 million kilowatt-hours a year—equivalent to the output of a typical 20-megawatt solar photovoltaic ( PV ) array . The efficiency improvements include upgrading to LED lighting , retro-commissioning building controls , and upgrading heating , ventilation , and air-conditioning systems . When designing new buildings , we optimize energy efficiency through use of high-efficiency lighting and heating , ventilation , and air-conditioning systems and through careful selection of windows , insulation , shading , and roofing materials to reduce heating and air-conditioning loads . 11 Environmental Responsibility Report | 2016 Progress Report , Covering FY2015100 percent of our data centers run on 100 percent renewable energy . Our data centers are built with the environment in mind , often including innovative energy efficiency measures .

Our data centers have been 100 percent renewable since 2013 . And we ’ re continuing to find innovative ways to bring renewable energy projects to the places where we consume a lot of energy . For example , we recently partnered with the local utility , Duke Energy , to develop a green energy tariff—Duke Energy ’ s Green Source Rider Program . This program allowed us to co-develop five solar PV projects in North Carolina , the first of which came online in October 2015 . For more information about Apple ’ s industry-leading efforts to supply our data centers with 100 percent renewable energy , see Appendix B . Innovating on rooftops in Singapore . Singapore is so densely populated that there ’ s no space on the ground for a large-scale solar project . So we designed an entirely new solution . We worked with local renewable energy provider Sunseap to source clean energy from roughly 32 megawatts of solar panels on more than 800 rooftops in the city . This first-of-its-kind project will produce enough energy to run all our Singapore offices and our part of the shared data center that we use for extra computing capacity . To further advance the renewable energy market in Singapore and to ensure account - ability and traceability of our generation , Apple worked closely with APX ( a renewable energy tracking software developer ) and other key partners to develop a regional renewable energy tracking system , similar to those in North America and Europe . Apple is using the tracking system now and soon it will be opened to renewable energy generators and purchasers in Singapore and elsewhere in Asia .

Energy Efficiency An important first step in managing energy use is to ensure our facilities use as little as possible . That ’ s why we design them for maximum energy efficiency , and regularly audit their energy use to identify further opportunities for energy optimization.2 . Renewable Energy Renewable Energy Generation . Where feasible , we produce our own renewable energy by building our own solar arrays , biogas fuel cells , and micro-hydro generation systems . Renewable Energy Investments .

Wind Water Biogas Fuel Cell Geothermal Solar Our renewable energy sourcing principles . We encounter many legal and regulatory frameworks around the world that constrain our renewable energy supply options . In each location , we endeavor to choose the strongest approach available to us as defined by three guiding principles : Displacement . We seek to displace the more polluting forms of energy in the same electric grid region in which we operate—by putting into the grid an amount of renewable energy equal to the amount of energy taken from the grid by our facilities.Additionality . We strive to create new clean energy that adds to the energy sources already delivering to the grid . This generally means participating in renewable energy projects that would not have been built without Apple ’ s involvement . We make sure that the energy we count toward our goals is not counted toward regulatory obligations that utilities must meet , such as the Renewable Portfolio Standards in many states . Accountability . We apply rigor in measuring and tracking our energy supply resources , and use third-party registries such as WREGIS and NC-RETS , certification programs such as Green-e Energy , and contractual provisions to ensure that all renewable energy supplied to Apple is supplied only to Apple . When needed , we work with industry partners and governmental entities to create such systems . Your grid is our grid .

The best way to think about it is like a bank : You can deposit $ 20 in one bank branch , then go to another branch and withdraw $ 20 . Renewable energy works in a similar way . And Apple ’ s renewable energy approach goes a step further to make sure we “ deposit ” on the same grid as the energy we are “ withdrawing. ” 13 Environmental Responsibility Report | 2016 Progress Report , Covering FY2015We are also changing how we design our stores to be better for the planet . For example , our latest store design is 40 percent more energy efficient and uses 30 percent less water than our previous design .

To support the micro-grid design , the onsite solar energy production will be augmented with biogas fuel cells and battery st orage . And air will flow freely between the inside and outside of the building , providing natural ventilation for 75 percent of the year , with highly efficient radiant heating and cooling the remainder of the year . The building itself is only part of the story . About 80 percent of the site will be open space , populated by more than 8000 trees , which includes over 7000 newly planted shade and fruit trees . Virtually all plants used throughout the landscape are drought- tolerant t o minimize freshwater use . W e ’ re also reclaiming as much rainwater as we can , and 157 ,000 gallons of recycled water from the city of Sunnyvale ’ s recycling facility will be used for the majority of our landscaping water needs at the new campus .

We ’ re lessening our impact when we commute or hit the road . As we shrink the carbon footprint of Apple ’ s facilities , we ’ re also continuing to look for ways to reduce carbon emissions from business fleet vehicles , employee commute , and business travel . Those emissions grew in fiscal year 2015 primarily because our employee count increased by 14 percent in the same period , and because long-distance business travel increased . We offer our United States employees a transit subsidy of up to US $ 100 per month , and at our Cupertino and surrounding Santa Clara Valley campus , we offer free coach buses to commute to and from our corporate offices . In fiscal year 2015 , use of these coach buses increased by close to 19 percent . And we ’ re seeing the difference this is making : In fiscal year 2015 , our emissions per employee dropped for the fourth year in a row ; they have decreased by close to 30 percent since fiscal year 2012 .

So whenever possible , we recycle our products in the region where they ’ re collected , reducing the carbon emissions associated with shipping . When we have to ship , we do it responsibly . Because we work closely with all our recyclers and with vetted facilities , nothing is dumped unsafely in developing countries , which is a common problem in our industry . Recycling is also good for reducing global carbon emissions . Fewer carbon emissions are created by recycling materials such as aluminum than by mining and smelting new materials .

Reuse & Recycling One of the best ways to use a resource is to reuse it . We work hard to keep electronic devices out of landfills so that the precious resources they contain can be reused . And we want to ensure that these devices are recycled properly so they don ’ t pose a threat to human health or the environment . That ’ s why we ’ ve developed recycling collection events , take-back initiatives , and efforts like Apple Renew , a global program that lets you bring used Apple devices to any Apple Store for reuse or responsible recycling . We ’ re also working with over 160 recyclers around the world , whose facilities we hold to rigorous standards of environmental compliance , health and safety , and social responsibility . Through our efforts , we ’ ve kept more than 597 million pounds of equipment out of landfills since 1994 . In 2015 , we collected nearly 90 million pounds of e-waste through our recycling programs .

Existing recycling techniques , like shredding , only recover a few kinds of materials and often diminish their quality . So we invented Liam , a line of robots designed to disassemble 1.2 million phones a year , sorting all their high-quality components and reducing the need to mine more resources from the earth . Liam prototypes are operating in California and the Netherlands . It ’ s an experiment in recy - cling technology , and we hope this kind of thinking will inspire others in our industry . Additionally , we ’ re committed to making sure all the waste created by our final assem - bly facilities and by us is reused , recycled , composted , or , when necessary , converted into energy . It ’ s an ambitious goal that requires collaboration among multiple Apple teams , local governments , and specialty recyclers , but we ’ ve already seen great success . In 2015 , our facility in Cork , Ireland , was the first outside North America to receive UL ’ s Zero Waste to Landfill validation . In 2016 , our final assembly sit es , Foxconn Guanlan and Foxconn Taiyuan , were the first to receive this validation in China , and all our remaining iPhone and Apple Watch final assembly sites are on track to do the same before 2017 .5 And most recently , all our stores worldwide have initiated zero waste programs .

The challenge was to address the remaining 30 percent—the small , low- or no-value , mixed waste materials that most recyclers will not accept . We worked closely with our suppliers to find innovative ways to reduce , recycle , eliminate , or incin - erate this waste for energy recovery . For example , at many of our iPhone and Apple Watch final assembly facilities , we implemented waste sorting on the line to separate previously landfilled recyclable waste . We also implemented a component tray reuse program for iPhone , allowing single-use trays to flow through the supply chain mul- tiple times . At other sites , suppliers established waste reduction campaigns and worked with local recyclers to process materials not previously accepted . In response to this program , all iPhone and Apple Watch final assembly suppliers now have “ zero waste ” or “ green ” teams to support this program and other environmental improvements . At our corporate offices and retail stores , wherever possible we ’ ve created robust recycling and composting programs to minimize the environmental impact of the waste we produce . In fiscal year 2015 , we generated approximately 13.1 million pounds of waste , and diverted over 22.5 million pounds of materials from landfill through recycling and composting . Our rate of landfill diversion was 63 percent , compared with 68 percent in fiscal year 2014 . We are working to improve our landfill diversion rate through a variety of actions , including expanding composting at our corporate campuses , and initiating zero waste at our more than 470 retail stores .

And now we ’ re identifying the high- , medium- , and low-scarcity areas where we use water , so we can focus our efforts where they matter most . When we began to measure the water consumption footprint of iPhone , we learned that the story was similar to our product carbon footprint : the vast majority is during the manufacturing phase . This is primarily due to water consumed in energy pro - duction , such as for oil extraction , distillation , and processing , as well as non-energy sources , such as process water consumed during metals processing . That ’ s why we are focusing on reducing water consumption in our supply chain , primarily through our supplier clean water and clean energy programs . 19 Environmental Responsibility Report | 2016 Progress Report , Covering FY2015Supplier Clean Water Program The water we use to manufacture our products has a direct effect on the communities in which we operate . We launched the Clean Water Program in 2013 to reduce the use of freshwater in our suppliers ’ processes . Through 2015 , 73 supplier facilities have joined our Clean Water Program—so we can help them improve their water and wastewater management systems , and reduce freshwater use . Through baseline assessments , per - formance evaluations , technical support , and training , we helped these facilities save more than 3.8 billion gallons of freshwater . We ’ re also focused on reuse of treated waste - water and have achieved an average wastewater reuse rate of 36 percent across these facilities . To ensure our efforts impact areas of greatest need , we prioritize facilities by evaluating water use data , reviewing product life cycle water consumption data to identify water-intensive component suppliers , and mapping that data to water-stressed geographies .

To meet the water needs of our offices , data centers , and retail stores across the world , Apple used 573 million gallons of water in fiscal year 2015 , which represented a 16 percent increase from fiscal year 2014 .

Incr ease responsible management of working forests in China—by creating up to 300,000 acres of Forest Stewardship Council ( FSC ) –certified forests , and up to 700,000 acres of forests under improved management . 2 . Improve China ’ s policy framework to encourage responsible forest management . 3 . Establish long-term market incentives in China for responsibly sourced paper . Since launching the project in 2015 , WWF has signed up forestry companies that are committed to certifying nearly 150,000 acres to the FSC standard and an additional 190,000 acres under improved management . Once certified , these forests will make a major contribution toward Apple ’ s goal of protecting and creating enough responsibly managed forests around the world to cover all our packaging needs . If successful , this project can shift the dynamics of the world ’ s paper market in both the short and long term , and in the process protect some of the world ’ s most important forests . Product Design A durable device is a greener device . When products can be used longer , fewer resources need to be extracted from the earth to make new ones . So we assess all our products in our Reliability Testing Lab , using custom , comprehensive measures .

You , our workers , and the planet . For years , we ’ ve led the electronics industry in removing toxins from devices . This past year , we started a Full Material Disclosure program , which will show us the chemical composition of every material in every component of our products . It also makes us even better at reducing or removing toxins . And once we figure out how to remove a toxin from a device or a manufacturing process , we use extensive testing to make sure it stays out . We ’ ve analyzed over 10,000 parts . And that ’ s just the beginning . Our Full Material Disclosure program seeks to identify all the substances we use in all the parts we use . We ’ ve already looked at more than 10,000 individual components , and we get data on more parts every day . We assess the different chemicals in those components using 18 different criteria . This helps us understand their effect on our health and on the environment . If we do find an unacceptable risk , we then seek alternatives or ban the substance altogether . We start this process early in the design and manufacturing phases so we can take appropriate actions to remove or replace hazardous chemicals . In some cases , few replacements are readily available so we work with our suppliers to find substitutions— or switch to another supplier that uses safer materials . If there is no replacement for the substance , we work with our design teams to explore how to eliminate the need for that substance . 25 Environmental Responsibility Report | 2016 Progress Report , Covering FY2015It took us four years to remove polyvinyl chloride , or PVC , from our power cords and headphone cables .

We tested dozens of formulations until we finally found the right blend of durability , safety , and environmental performance in our PVC replacement materials : nonchlorinated and nonbrominated thermoplastic elastomers . The worst toxins and what we ’ ve done about them . After we identify toxins in our products , we reduce them , remove them , or develop new materials that are safer . These efforts also remove toxins from our manufacturing and recycling processes , which protects workers and keeps pollutants out of the land , air , and water . Beryllium Found in copper alloys used to make connectors and springs . All new products are designed without the use of beryllium . MercuryEliminated in 2009 . We use energy-efficient , mercury-free LEDs instead of mercury-based fluorescent lamps in all our displays . LeadWe completely phased lead out of our display glass and solder in 2006.ArsenicTraditionally used in glass . Our display glass has been arsenic-free since 2008 . PVC and PhthalatesBoth are still used by other companies in power cords and headphone cables . We have replaced PVC and phthalates with thermoplastic elastomers . 11Brominated Flame Retardants ( BFRs ) Eliminated from thousands of parts such as enclosures , circuit boards , and connectors in 2008 . We use safer metal hydroxides and phosphorus compounds in their place . 26 Environmental Responsibility Report | 2016 Progress Report , Covering FY2015 We double-check our work .

But we can ’ t do it alone . We want insights and ideas from those who share our commitment to removing toxins . So , we formed our own Green Chemistry Advisory Board made up of some of the world ’ s leading toxicologists , researchers , and academics . They help us identify innovative ways to minimize or eliminate toxins from our supply chain . And we ’ re allowing the advisory board members to use our data to develop and publish research , which we hope will advance the use of safer chemistry , materials , and processes in all industries . We also invite experts from around the world to meet with leaders at Apple and we seek out the best ideas and insights from top NGOs . In 2015 , we worked with Ceres to convene a roundtable meeting with United States–based and international NGOs to gather feedback on our toxins work .

In 2015 , we took a new approach to support further growth at our Maiden data center : We partnered with the local utility , Duke Energy , to build five solar PV projects through Duke Energy ’ s Green Source Rider program . These solar PV projects , which began coming online in October 2015 to support our Maiden data center , were Duke ’ s first Green Source Rider projects to become operational . We worked with Duke Energy for several years to develop this green energy tariff option , which allowed Apple and Duke Energy to work together to develop new renewable energy projects . Apple ’ s Maiden data center was the first facility to begin benefiting from renewable energy through this program . The five projects have a combined peak capacity of 20 megawatts . All told , Apple ’ s data center will be supported by projects that generate 244 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy a year , which is equiva - lent to the energy used by over 17 ,900 North Carolina homes . * Among Maiden ’ s energy efficiency features is the use of outside air cooling through a waterside economizer during night and cool-weather hours , which , along with water storage , allows the chillers to be turned off more than 75 percent of the time ."

This review and verification focuses on Scope 3 emissions for products sold by Apple Inc. ( as defined by WRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse Gas Protocol – Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard ) . It is noted that emissions relating to the facilities that are owned or leas ed by Apple ( scope 1 and 2 emissions ) as well as business travel and employee commute were subject to a separate third party verification and are therefore excluded from the scope of this statement . Confidential data relating to product sales and shipments were also excluded from the scope of this verification . This review and verification covers Apple ’ s corporate annual greenhouse gas emissions and does not replace reviews conducted for indi vidual product LCAs for greenhouse gas emissions ( GHGs ) . The life cycle emissions data produced by Apple for individual products has been calculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/14044 : Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Principles and framework / Requirements and guidelines . This review and verification furthermore complies with ISO 14064-3 : Greenhouse gases -- Part 3 : Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions .

This review comprises a check of selected data , which are most influential to the overall company carbon footprint . The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions :  Are product LCAs referenced correctly ?  Are results for products , for which no full LCA review was undertaken , plausible ?  Are carbon emission data for individual products plausible in the light of methodological changes as indicated by Apple ? This review was done remotely . 3 Findings Prior to this CCF review and verification 14 recent product LCA studies , including for the first time separately sold accessories , have been reviewed successfully against ISO 14040/44 . These recent LCAs cover most important product segments ( Apple Watch , iPad , iPhone , iPod , MacBook , MacBook Pro , and Beats products ) .

NASDAQ_AAPL_2016,"This text comes from the document NASDAQ_AAPL_2016. review and verification 14 recent product LCA studies , including for the first time separately sold accessories , have been reviewed successfully against ISO 14040/44 . These recent LCAs cover most important product segments ( Apple Watch , iPad , iPhone , iPod , MacBook , MacBook Pro , and Beats products ) . These latest LCA studies cover products which represent in total 47,2 % of the total scope 3 company carbon footprint . Representatives of other product segments ( iMac , Mac Pro , Mac Mini , Airport Express / 43 CCF Review and Verification Client : Apple Inc. 4Airport Extreme , Apple TV and Cinema Display ) underwent no or only minor design changes compared to those which went through a full LCA review in former years . The methodological changes implemented with the 2015 CCF data are confirmed to lead to an improvement in terms of accuracy and real use patterns representation of the results . Inevitably this hampers the comparability of 2015 results with earlier CCF data . All questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed . 4 Conclusions We observe from year to year an improvement of the assessment approach in terms of granularity of the used calculation data . This year the use phase models have been enhanced , taking into account real use pattern data . Several additional components are now modelled with primary data from Apple ’ s suppliers . For all product LCA calculations , where exact data was missing , the principle of a worst- case approach has been followed and results have been calculated with rather conservative estimates regarding e.g . production yield losses and recycling . The review has not found assumptions or calculation errors on the CCF data level that indicate the scope 3 corporate carbon footprint has been materially misstated . The excellent analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice . Berlin , March 24 , 2016 - Karsten Schischke - - Marina Proske - Fraunhofer IZM Fraunhofer IZM Dept .

Environmental and Dept . Environmental and Reliability Engineering Reliability Engineering 44 Company Fiber Footprint Review Client : Apple Inc. 1Review Statement Company Fiber Footprint Fraunhofer IZM reviewed Apple ’ s company fiber footprint data related to the products manufactured and sold by Apple Inc. in fiscal year 2015 . 1 Summary This review checks transparency of data and calculations , appropriateness of supporting product and packaging related data and assumptions , and overall plausibility of the calculated corporate annual fiber footprint of Apple products shipped in fiscal year 2015 . As there is no standardised method available for calculating a product or company fiber footprint Apple defined a methodology for internal use . The scope of the Fiber Footprint includes Apple ’ s co rporate fiber usage from products . Facility fiber usage is explicitly excluded . The fiber footprint tracks the total amount of wood fiber , both virgin and recycled , that Apple uses in packaging , and other paper products . Apple obtains and analyses supplier-specific data for each pr oduct line and sums up these figures for the entire company using sell-in numbers . The output is a total fiber footprint . The review of the corporate annual fiber footprint has considered the following criteria : The system boundaries are clearly defined Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate Use of supplier data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately disclosed Data reported by Apple is as follows : Total Fiber Virgin Fiber Recycled Fiber 2015 132,741 51,669 81,072 [ metric tons fiber ] [ metric tons fiber ] [ metric tons fiber ] All results and figures reviewed for fiscal year 2015 are plausible . 45 Company Fiber Footprint Review Client : Apple Inc. 22 Reviewed Data and Findings As part of this review Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM : Calculation methodology for the company fiber footprint Sales data for FY2015 , including accessories Product and supplier specific data on packaging design ( including CAD design drawings ) , materials ( distinction of paper qualities , fiber content , including recycled fiber content ) ,"

Where appropriate , this approach follows methodological principles applied for state-of-the-art Life Cycle Assessments . This review comprises a check of fiber data for selected products , which are most influential to the overall company fiber footprint and which represent the full spectrum of Apple products . The selection of products for individual reviews has been agreed between Apple and Fraunhofer IZM . Plausibility of some supplier data has been questioned and discussed in detail with Apple . Based on direct supplier feedback related fiber data has been corrected . This review was done remotely . All questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed . Based on the process and procedures conducted , there is no evidence that the corporate fiber footprint is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of fiber data and information .
