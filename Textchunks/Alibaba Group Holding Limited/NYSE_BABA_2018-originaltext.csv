Foundations for Sustainable GrowthESG R EPORT 2018 We have always felt a responsibility to help solve problems in society , because that is implied in our mission – “ to make it easy to do business anywhere ” – and we must consider how we will continue to manage risks and opportunities , including those associated with environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) factors .

We believe that a profitable and prosperous business can only be achieved and sustained by solving large-scale societal problems . Today , the Alibaba Digital Economy not only supports the infrastructure of commerce but also serves hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of millions of enterprises , most of them small businesses . This economy extends far beyond our immediate customers to impact the lives and businesses of all stakeholders in our ecosystem . Alibaba has become an institution of public trust . In this ESG report , our first such report for the investment community , we will share with you how we hold ourselves accountable to the highest standards of public trust . This report complements what we already report domestically to stakeholders on a regular basis and summarizes key information in one place for easy reference . You will learn that we are firmly of the view that the key to good governance and sustainability starts with a strong company culture and tone at the top from responsible leaders . That is why , in this report , we provide insights into an Letter from the Chairman understanding of Alibaba ’ s mission and vision and the role played by the Alibaba Partnership , a unique organization of the most senior members of management with the purpose of safeguarding our culture , talent development and sound governance framework . In 2010 we formed the Alibaba Partnership because we recognized that , in order for us to develop a sustainable business , we needed a system that could outlast the Alibaba founders . Our system of governance transcends mere policies , rules , processes and procedures . The Alibaba Partnership ensures that the company is driven by a clear mission , supported by a strong culture , and inspired by the right leaders . At Alibaba , we expect our leaders to walk the talk , honor their commitments , own their mistakes , and approach problems with open-mindedness , respect and humility . One of the most difficult yet most important governance issues challenging public institutions is managing leadership transition . Succession planning is not only about the selection of the right people but also continuity of mission , vision and values . Recently I announced that , on September 10 , 2019 , I will hand over the role of chairman of Alibaba Group to our chief executive officer Daniel Zhang . This report sheds light on how we manage leadership transition – by focusing on human capital development and asking whether our mission , vision and values are still intact – a process in which the Alibaba Partnership plays a critical role . I hope you will take away something meaningful from engaging in a conversation with us through this report . We also welcome further comments and views you may have and look forward to hearing from you . Thank you for all of your support . Sincerely yours , JACK MA Executive Chairman September 17 , 2018 Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 02 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX As of fiscal year 2018 2036Our Goals 642 M 2BN Annual active consumers2Consumers globally 10 M 10 M Small and medium sized businesses globallyProfitable businesses globally 36 M 100 M Jobs created directly and indirectly3Jobs created directly and indirectlyAlibaba Digital Economy Our Mission is “ to make it easy to do business anywhere. ” We and our affiliates are in the business of providing e-commerce , retail , local services , entertainment , healthcare , cloud computing and financial services to both consumers and enterprises , which we refer to collectively as the Alibaba Digital Economy 1 . We apply our mission in every aspect of our operations to solve customers ’ problems by removing barriers between producers of goods , services or content and their end consumers . As of March 31 , 2018 , we served 552 million annual active consumers in China and another 90 million outside China . We provide essential infrastructure and services to tens of millions of small businesses within our digital ecosystem . Our vision is that by 2036 , we will serve 2 billion consumers globally and help create 100 million jobs by supporting 10 million businesses to operate profitably.Since 2010 , the management team members who manage the Alibaba Digital Economy operate as a partnership that we refer to as the Alibaba Partnership ( for more details refer to Corporate Governance , page 07 ) . The partners in the Alibaba Partnership are custodians of the Alibaba Digital Economy . Our job is to continue to grow the Alibaba Digital Economy and safeguard the interests of all its stakeholders . Understanding how we do this complex job is fundamental to understanding the importance we put on our responsibility and aim for sustainability . 1 The Alibaba Digital Economy includes businesses under Alibaba Group , Ant Financial Services Group , Cainiao Network , Ele.me and Koubei , Alibaba Health , Alibaba Pictures and their affiliated entities.2 552M consumers in China and 90M outside of China from Lazada and AliExpress 3 Source : According to a recent report by the Renmin University of China , Alibaba created 36 million jobs in 2017 via its retail ecosystem , including 14 million jobs for online retailers and 22 million jobs for upstream and downstream sectors such as R & D , design , manufacturing and logistics .

The Alibaba Digital Economy spans a vast scale of business operations with constituencies that include consumers , merchants , producers , creators , service providers , business partners , regulators , employees and of course our shareholders . With the mission “ to make it easy to do business anywhere , ” these stakeholders rely on us to solve many of their business problems . We believe that solving people ’ s problems and doing so ethically is the way to create value for society , and hence derive value for our company and shareholders . Sustainability : At the Core of What We Do We believe public trust is earned by demonstrating that everything we do is sustainable . As a corporation with shareholders who expect us to make a profit , Alibaba defines “ sustainability ” as focusing on long-term value creation that drives sustainable profits . The pursuit of sustainability requires that we do the right thing when our business impacts the environment and society , and we need a system of governance to ensure that we are always choosing the right ethical path . This report is about how we address these environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) considerations , putting customers and employees first and championing small businesses . To make it easy to do business anywhere Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 05OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX Alibaba ’ s sustainability prioritiesA Focus on What Matters Most : Our ESG Priorities For this first ESG report , we undertook a rigorous materiality assessment that included input from internal and external stakeholders . Over the past year , we surveyed about 50 institutional shareholders representing around US $ 65 billion of our market capitalization as well as input from , among others , our customers and employees . Their input and this process led us to identify the seven issues ( in box to right ) as most critical to the sustainability of our business .

We would like to thank the customers , employees and shareholders whose views guided us in publishing this report . Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 06OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX • Corporate Governance at Alibaba Alibaba has a unique governance model . To understand our system of corporate governance , it is important to understand the role of our Mission that guides us , our Vision that brings focus to our strategy , and our Partnership System that plays an active role in key decisions in the areas of leadership succession , human capital management , business ethics and social responsibility . OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 07 Our Vision by 2036The Role of Mission and Vision Typical public corporations think of “ corporate governance ” as a set of policies , rules , processes and compliance procedures . The presumption is that the profit motive inherently encourages risk taking by managers that must be tempered by checks and balances that reflect ethical considerations . We do not view “ growth ” versus “ governance ” as a zero-sum game . In fact , quite the opposite . We believe a company must be mission-driven in order to achieve sustainability.SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY DEFINES OUR MISSION AND VISION The belief in our mission – to make it easy to do business anywhere – is the foundational logic underlying our business decisions . We believe that we do not create value if we do not solve the problems of society , and if we do not create value for our customers , then the company will not be able to generate any revenue , much less profits , from customers . We have stated publicly that we want Alibaba to last – “ at least 102 years ” which would span three centuries from our founding in 1999 . Our vision – to serve 2 billion consumers globally and help create 100 million jobs by supporting 10 million businesses to operate profitably by year 2036 – helps us set long-term strategy and goals that are consistent with our values .

We have stated publicly that we want Alibaba to last – “ at least 102 years ” which would span three centuries from our founding in 1999 . Our vision – to serve 2 billion consumers globally and help create 100 million jobs by supporting 10 million businesses to operate profitably by year 2036 – helps us set long-term strategy and goals that are consistent with our values . This vision focuses our priorities on consumer trust , small business and job creation.We ask that everyone joining our company commit to our mission and vision . If we weren ’ t guided by a common mission , then Alibaba would be a mere investment holding company with disparate businesses . With the collective pursuit of a clear vision , our various businesses will work together to generate synergies that drive long-term sustainable growth . Because we believe Alibaba ’ s business should be guided and driven by our mission and vision , socially responsible elements – i.e. , solving customer problems , earning consumer trust , helping small businesses and creating jobs – are embedded in our business model . To serve 2 billion consumers globally Support 10 million businesses to operate profitably Help create 100 million jobs Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 08 Alibaba Group Holding LimitedESG Report 2018 08 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX The Role of the Alibaba Partnership The Alibaba Partnership ( the “ Partnership ” ) is at the heart of our company culture and identity . Currently comprised of 36 senior management leaders who oversee the various aspects of the Alibaba Digital Economy , the Partnership has had a clear purpose since it was formed in 2010 : to sustain the culture of the founders of Alibaba in order to ensure that we stay on course in defining and executing our mission , vision and values.HOW THE ALIBABA PARTNERSHIP OPERATES Living Body : The Alibaba Partnership is a dynamic group of people that operates as a living body , adding new blood through the admission of new partners each year . Partners are required to retire from the Partnership if they are no longer contributing to the work of growing the Alibaba Digital Economy . Since its founding , the Partnership has expanded from the admission of new partners each year ; currently there are 36 members of the Partnership . Partnership Charter : The Partnership is governed by a Partnership agreement ( the “ Partnership Charter ” ) and operates under principles , policies and procedures that have evolved with our business . The key provisions of the Partnership Charter address , among other things , the criteria and duties of the partners , their right to vote on matters of importance to the Partnership , and meeting quorum and voting procedures . Admission of New Partners : The most important element of the Partnership is the annual process of selecting and admitting new partners to the Partnership . New partner candidates are selected on the criteria of • personal character ; • impact on our business ; • demonstrated ability to live and evangelize our culture ; and • at least five years tenure of service to the Alibaba Digital Economy . Admission of new partners requires the approval of at least 75 % of all partners . Collective Decision-Making : All Partnership votes are made on a one-partner-one-vote basis . Each partner has a vote equal to that of any other partner on matters that come to the Partnership for decision : election of new partners , expulsion of partners , selection of Partnership-nominated board members to Alibaba Group , and amendment of the Partnership Charter , to name a few . Stock Ownership : Another important element of the Partnership is that each partner has share ownership in Alibaba Group that is substantial relative to their net worth . The average partner has no less than a majority of their net worth in the shares ALIBABA PARTNERSHIP COMPOSITION By Gender 24 Male Partners12 Female PartnersFemale ( 33 % ) Male ( 67 % ) of Alibaba Group . Newly admitted partners are awarded shares in the Alibaba Group that vest over 10 years , and each partner must retain a significant level of share ownership that aligns the partners ’ interests with the stockholders of the company . Diversity and Experience : Of the 36 current partners of the Partnership , 12 partners ( 33 % ) are women , and 32 of the partners ( 89 % ) have been employed within the Alibaba Digital Economy for more than 10 years . Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 09 Alibaba Group Holding LimitedESG Report 2018 09OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX The Role of the Alibaba Partnership continued BOARD COMPOSITION Based on our articles of association , the Alibaba Partnership has the right to nominate a majority of the board of directors of Alibaba Group , although the Partnership may choose not to fully exercise that right . Board candidates nominated by the Partnership , as well as independent directors recommended by the board ’ s nominating and corporate governance committee , are elected to the board by the majority vote of all of Alibaba Group ’ s shareholders . Currently , five of the eleven board members ( Jack Ma , Joe Tsai , Daniel Zhang , Eric Jing and Michael Evans ) are nominated by the Partnership , five of the board members ( C.H . Tung , Walter Kwauk , Jerry Yang , Börje Ekholm and Wan Ling Martello ) are independent directors nominated by the Board ’ s nominating and corporate governance committee , and one director ( Masayoshi Son ) is nominated by SoftBank Group which has been a long-term investor in Alibaba Group since 2000 . HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP SUCCESSION One of the most important roles of public company boards is the selection and appointment of their company ’ s senior leadership , in particular the chairman and chief executive officer . Through Partnership-nominated directors , the Partnership plays a crucial role in advising our Board in developing senior management talent from within and planning for leadership succession . This process reduces the risk of leaving succession management to chance . The continuous cultivation and annual selection process of admitting new partners into the Partnership is the vehicle for us to identify talented individuals throughout our organization who exemplify our culture and embody the required leadership traits we look for in managing our business . These leadership traits include : • integrity , • intellect , • emotional intelligence , • ethical conduct , • energy , • ability to influence , • strategic mindset , • open-mindedness , • resilience , • self-awareness , and • humility . We expect that partners fulfill their responsibility as culture carriers and demonstrate the ability to evangelize our mission , vision and values to our customers , employees , shareholders and other stakeholders . Partners must continuously serve in the businesses of the Alibaba Digital Economy and have a track record of contribution , performance and positive impact to our business . Because each partner has been carefully selected through the partner development and admission process with a focus on leadership and cultural traits in addition to proven performance and management ability , the pool of partners provides the primary source of talent for our leadership . As in the case of other public companies , our board determines leadership succession at the highest level by selecting and appointing our chairman and chief executive officer . On leadership succession , board members nominated by the Partnership fulfil their directorship duties by counseling and offering their knowledge about potential internal senior candidates to the independent directors . Because Partnership-nominated directors are familiar with the company ’ s senior leaders through the talent development process as partners , our board is afforded a much more complete and transparent view of the company ’ s human capital and leadership succession alternatives when the critical time comes for senior management transition . Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 10 Alibaba Group Holding LimitedESG Report 2018 10 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX In summaryThe Role of the Alibaba Partnership continued ETHICAL CONDUCT The Alibaba Partnership is the steward of our company ’ s conscience . Partners are expected to not only conduct themselves with integrity but also to monitor the ethical conduct of all of our employees as well as their business practices . Through the established procedure of expulsion ( via the vote of over 50 % of the partners ) , the Partnership may expel partners who do not fulfil expectations on integrity and ethical conduct or repeatedly breach our stated values . Partners have a duty to set the tone at the top . Through day-to-day management of businesses within the Alibaba Digital Economy , they are expected to communicate the values of the company to employees through actions and various interactions with employees such as meetings , speeches and group discussions . Among the values we have identified as important to sustainability , we especially emphasize “ customer first ” and “ integrity ” as the core values that guide our ethical conduct . Our customer-first mentality ensures that we put serving those who give us our raison d ’ être as the highest priority . We believe that if we adhere to the principle of doing right by our customers , our employees will make the right judgment and do the right thing when the interests of our customers conflict with the short-term profit motive . We believe that if our customers are well-served by our employees , then our shareholders will benefit from the resulting value creation . Integrity is at the center of how we expect the partners in the Partnership to demonstrate leadership . Specifically , in management and leadership positions , partners are expected to walk the talk , approach issues with honesty and openness , own their mistakes and honor commitments . We believe that the expectations we put on the partners who lead our businesses will influence our entire workforce by setting the right tone at the top . SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Partners in the Alibaba Partnership are expected to make personal contribution of time and financial resources to solving social problems that require long-term investment and therefore do not receive the attention of the commercial sector . Partners have established individual and joint foundations to carry out their philanthropic activities . Some of the focus areas include education , eradication of poverty , environmental improvements , and economic and social mobility for women . Worthy of note are the Jack Ma Foundation , which focuses on rural education , poverty and entrepreneurship , and Lakeside Modou Foundation , a foundation collectively established by the 12 women partners in the Partnership to provide care and a better future to women and children in rural and underdeveloped areas of China . The partners believe that philanthropy must be sustainable , which means that their initiatives should inspire others to action and leverage all available societal resources beyond their own . For example , when the Jack Ma Foundation initiated a program to improve education for children in poverty stricken areas , the Foundation created an annual prize to select and award 100 model rural teachers and recruited international architects to help design dormitories featuring clean sanitary conditions and caring community spaces for school children on a pro bono basis.We believe our Partnership system is a strong positive feature of our corporate governance framework in the following ways : • The high standards of personal character and ethical conduct required of partners ensure that we set the right tone at the top ;"

Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 11 Alibaba Group Holding LimitedESG Report 2018 11OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX The Role of the Board and Board Committees The Alibaba board is responsible for the long-term success of the company through nominating independent directors , selecting the chairman and chief executive officer , monitoring strategy and management execution , setting senior management compensation , and providing oversight to the company ’ s financial reporting , internal control systems , business conduct and code of ethics . Our board of directors has established an audit committee , a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee . All members of our audit committee are independent directors . A majority of the members of our compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee are independent directors . Brief descriptions of these committees follow , and more detail can be found in our annual report on Form 20-F . Audit Committee The Audit Committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of our financial statements ; selects , evaluates and supervises our independent auditor ; oversees our internal accounting controls and audit procedures ; reviews and approves related party transactions ; oversees procedures for employee complaints and concerns ; and reports regularly to the full board of directors . The Audit Committee is chaired by Walter Kwauk , an independent director with 25 years of senior leadership experience in the audit industry with KPMG.We maintain a Related Party Transaction Policy that stipulates that , unless otherwise pre-approved by our board of directors , all related party transactions , including transactions involving directors , officers , and other members of senior management , must be approved or ratified by the Audit Committee . We have an internal audit department of 29 employees and our head of internal audit reports directly to the Audit Committee . The internal audit function conducts independent and continuous testing of the integrity and robustness of our financial reporting , operational system controls , IT general controls and design of key policies and procedures . Our internal audit staff meets as frequently as twice a month with the chair of the Audit Committee and quarterly with other members of the Audit Committee to review their work . Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee oversees our compensation policies ; reviews the performance of our directors and executive officers ; determines the compensation to our executive officers , approves the aggregate bonus pool allocated to the partners of the Alibaba Partnership who are our employees ; and monitors policies and magnitude of equity incentives to our employees as a whole . The compensation committee is chaired by independent director Jerry Yang , co-founder and former chief executive officer of Yahoo ! Inc . Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee The Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee recommends independent director nominees ; reviews board composition with regards to characteristics such as independence , knowledge , skills , experience and diversity ; advises the board on corporate governance and compliance matters . The nominating and governance committee is chaired by our board chairman Jack Ma . Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 12 Alibaba Group Holding LimitedESG Report 2018 12OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX Related Party Transactions “ Related party transaction ” is both a legal and ethical concept . Certain legal definitions of transactions between “ related parties ” do not create a conflict of interest between the company ’ s management , directors or major shareholders and the interests of its independent shareholders . For example , a commercial contract between Alibaba Group and a company in which Alibaba Group is a 30 % shareholder is by definition a “ related party transaction ” under the U.S. securities rules governing foreign private issuers and the analysis our board must make to ensure the fair and arms-length nature of the transaction is no different from the analysis that one would apply to transactions between unrelated parties . On the other hand , transactions between the company and a director , officer or major shareholder could potentially raise the issue of conflict of interest that requires stricter scrutiny by our board and its audit committee . It is with this philosophy in mind – knowing the distinction between technical related party transactions and transactions that give rise to apparent or actual conflict – that we created the governance framework for the board and our management to evaluate and approve related party transactions . One particularly significant instance of high standards of scrutiny is our agreement announced earlier this year for Alibaba Group to terminate a profit interest , and instead acquire a 33 % equity stake in , Ant Financial and ancillary transactions . Because Ant Financial is a company in which the partners of Alibaba Partnership and the employees of Alibaba Group have significant equity shareholding , the transactions went through a rigorous process of evaluation and scrutiny by our board . The transactions were carefully reviewed and approved by a committee comprised of only independent directors and the non-executive director appointed by SoftBank Group . The committee was advised by independent legal and financial advisors . In addition , the Audit Committee of the board , comprised of only independent directors , reviewed and approved the transaction . For more information on how we handle related party transactions see our annual report on Form 20-F. Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 13 Alibaba Group Holding LimitedESG Report 2018 13OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX Asset Ownership in Compliance with Regulations In order to comply with relevant laws , rules and regulations in China governing foreign investment in certain types of internet businesses , we use a corporate structure similar to that adopted by many peer companies in our industry . Our Internet Content Provider Licenses required to operate certain internet businesses in China are held by entities whose direct or indirect owners are Chinese nationals that are either founders or employees of Alibaba or members of the Alibaba Partnership . Alibaba Group has entered into a series of agreements with such entities , that under accounting rules are referred to as “ variable interest entities ” or VIEs , and their Chinese national owners , such that Alibaba consolidates the VIEs on its financial statements because Alibaba , among other things , ( i ) bears the economic risk and benefits of the VIEs , ( ii ) through contracts such as technology and licensing agreements , is entitled to substantially all of the profits of the VIEs , ( iii ) has an exclusive option to acquire the shares or assets in such VIEs if permitted by law , and ( iv ) holds the voting proxy with respect to such VIEs . We believe that we have structured our VIEs to be best-in-class from the point of view of financial integrity , economic participation , asset security and control over free cash flow of the business . As of the end of Fiscal 2018 ( March year-end ) , assets in the VIEs in aggregate do not exceed 8 % of the total assets of Alibaba Group , and the VIEs generated approximately 13 % of consolidated group revenues and less than 5 % in consolidated operating cash flows during the then-ended fiscal year . In other words , the vast majority of Alibaba Group ’ s assets , revenues and cash flow belong to wholly owned entities of Alibaba Group in which we have sole legal title and control . In addition , most of the critical assets of our business , such as user data , customer contracts , intellectual property , technology infrastructure and software source code are held in controlled or wholly–owned subsidiaries of Alibaba Group . Subject to foreign currency regulations in China , our shareholders have direct access to substantial cash flows generated by Alibaba Group ’ s businesses because much of our assets and business activities that generate cash flow are owned by or conducted through subsidiaries that are controlled or wholly owned by Alibaba Group . Access to cash flow is a key feature that rating agencies take into consideration when assigning a credit rating . Alibaba Group has the best credit rating ( A1 by Moody ’ s/A+ by S & P/A+ by Fitch ) among all private Asian corporate issuers . MINIMAL REVENUES FROM VIE s 87 % 13 % VIEs ( 13 % ) Wholly owned entities ( 87 % ) MINIMAL ASSETS IN VIE s 92 % 8 % Assets in VIEs ( 8 % ) Assets not held in VIEs ( 92 % ) Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 14 Alibaba Group Holding LimitedESG Report 2018 14OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX Read more As outlined in our corporate governance policies : 1 We encourage shareholders to engage with us and make their views known to the board or to the independent directors as a group , especially at the time of our annual general meeting and by writing to our Company Secretary . 2 Our independent directors have the chance to meet in executive session with no management members present at all regularly scheduled board meetings . 3 Our Integrity Compliance Department has the power to conduct investigations of any suspected non-compliance with the law or our Code of Ethics , and has authority over all directors , officers and employees .

Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 16OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX Intellectual Property Rights Protection The protection of intellectual property rights ( IPR ) is core to the operation of a healthy marketplace . Trust is essential for the health and sustainability of Alibaba ’ s business , and consumers and merchants place tremendous trust in our online marketplaces . We have established an industry-leading IPR operation that ensures we are a source of branded , authorized goods , and that strongly deters the sale of illicit or unauthorized goods , in order to protect the interests of rights holders , brands and consumers . Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 17 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX | INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION | CYBERSECURITY | DATA PROTECTION | Intellectual Property Rights Protection We are proactive in our approach , aiming to identify problems early before we receive complaints . Our IP Protection Department is charged with the critical responsibility of maintaining a healthy and dynamic business environment throughout Alibaba ’ s e-commerce ecosystem . This unit is led by our Chief Risk Officer , who is also our Chief Platform Governance Officer , and she reports directly to our CEO . Over 300 professionals work in this business unit including senior global team members who communicate with global rights holders and brand associations on a regular basis . To effectively protect the rights of brand owners on our large online platform , we make extensive use of cutting edge , proprietary technology . Our proactive monitoring and takedown system for problematic listings is driven by sophisticated data-base algorithms and textual analysis and photo , optical character and behavior recognition technologies . Our philosophy is to partner with brands , understand their particular product characteristics , and utilize our technology to proactively monitor our platforms . Then , we make it easy for brands to report and track complaints – which over time has allowed us to continually improve our IP Protection Program.Brands and brand owners are key constituents of our platform . We proactively established the Alibaba Anti-Counterfeiting Alliance ( “ AACA ” or the “ Alliance ” ) in January 2017 . AACA ’ s 105 brand members include Adidas , P & G , Mars , Adobe , Danone , Hasbro , Samsung , and L ’ Oreal . With their support , the Alliance is effectively using internet technology and data to combat IP infringement more efficiently and transparently . We recently launched a program of IP Protection Roadshows in countries around the world where we present to global brands about the tools Alibaba offers to fight IP infringement . Additionally , we have a scheme to support small brands who may not have the same level of resources to protect their original designs or patents . Working with brands is not enough . We also take the fight offline to work with trade associations , governments and law enforcement agencies in the fight to protect IPR . Industry groups we work with come from the automotive , digital content , apparel , electronics , luxury goods , food , pharmaceutical , and personal care sectors . We also partner with law enforcement agencies to provide leads of suspected illicit manufacturing facilities . We believe it ’ s equally important to attack the bad actors at the source in the physical world . The goal is to encourage all parties to collaboratively fight counterfeiting through communication and information exchange . We openly communicate our IPR efforts to the public by publishing an Intellectual Property Rights Protection Annual Report and Intellectual Property Rights Protection Handbook . We regularly report our progress in this program ; our results speak for themselves .

Therefore , there exists the possibility of misaligned incentives or disagreement over philanthropic vision . Yet responsible corporations today must demonstrate that they can make a difference to society through altruism . For these reasons , we firmly believe corporate philanthropy goes beyond charitable giving and must serve as a call to action for our entire workforce as well as participants in our ecosystem . Our approach to making social contributions is two-pronged . First , as described in many examples in other parts of this report , we take the approach of developing commercially viable projects that are embedded in the services across a wide range of businesses in the Alibaba Digital Economy so that the impact is long-lasting . Through our businesses , our customers including hundreds of millions of consumers and merchants , our employees and other stakeholders implicitly participate in making social impact that is sustainable . Social Impact continued Second , on a not-for-profit basis , Alibaba Group , our employees and the partners in the Alibaba Partnership make contributions of personal time as well as financial and other resources to support national and global-scale causes . We also help selected charitable organizations raise funding by making the vast reach of our user-facing platforms available to them . Here ’ s a sampling of our not-for-profit efforts : • Since 2010 , we have established a special fund to encourage environmental awareness and conservation as well as other corporate social responsibility initiatives . In 2011 , we established the Alibaba Foundation , a private charity fund that focuses on supporting environmental protection in China and helping the disadvantaged . In fiscal year 2018 , we and the Alibaba Foundation made approximately RMB230 million ( US $ 37 million ) in donations . • The partners in the Alibaba Partnership have established personal foundations to advance philanthropic causes consistent with the social mission of the company . Among them are the Lakeside Modou Foundation established by the 12 women partners and the Jack Ma Foundation which focuses on rural education , poverty and entrepreneurship , as described elsewhere in this report.Helping people out of poverty We connect rural merchants and sellers to the global marketplace through our platform , giving them additional income channels and helping people who live in rural areas move out of poverty . Our Rural Taobao program involves Alibaba establishing business infrastructure and e-commerce services in rural areas that enable rural residents and businesses to sell high-quality agricultural products to urban consumers . The program generates business and employment opportunities and establishes a two-way distribution infrastructure to connect commerce between cities and rural areas in China . To date , our Rural Taobao program has established service centers in over 30,000 villages and 730 counties in China , including 300 state-designated impoverished counties .

The Jack Ma Foundation will host an annual competition , with 10 finalists receiving grant funding and access to the community of African business leaders for mentorship and other resources . • We encourage each employee to dedicate three hours per year to social impact causes , and we motivate our employees to do so by asking them to reflect on what it means to live a purposeful life . Since the establishment of the “ 3 hours ” program in 2015 , Alibaba employees have accumulated a total of 482,601 hours for social services . • Through our platforms , we supported over 1.7 million merchants and over 360 million users to donate to domestic and international charitable projects . We also enabled charitable organizations to raise approximately US $ 50 million in donations in fiscal year 2018 , which benefited approximately 3.3 million disadvantaged individuals.Social Impact continued 482,601 Hours volunteered by Alibaba employees since 2015US $ 50 M Raised by charitable organizations on our platform in fiscal year 2018 1.7M Merchants and 360+ million users have donated to charitable causes using our platform US $ 10M Netpreneur Prize Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 42 | HUMAN CAPITAL | SOCIAL IMPACT |OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX Environment In this section , we discuss the relationship of Alibaba to the physical world in which we operate . We are serious about minimizing our carbon footprint and applying innovation to environmental sustainability challenges . Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 43OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX Environment A clean environment is the earth ’ s scarce resource . Even though we are not an industrial manufacturing company with a significant environmental footprint , we recognize that every company , no matter what business it is in , has a responsibility to minimize its environmental impact . We are driving environmental sustainability by innovating in the highest impact areas of our business . All the initiatives we undertake in environmental sustainability are fundamentally connected to our core business practices and help inform our long-term strategies to make sure our businesses and systems adapt to the future . Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 44 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX Case studyEnvironment continued We run an e-commerce business where tens of millions of packages are generated for delivery on our shopping platforms . Therefore , we are mindful of the environmental effect of paper and plastic packaging as well as the carbon footprint of transport systems in logistics . We provide daily services to hundreds of millions of consumers , mostly through our mobile app platforms . Thus , we believe that we have a responsibility to bring environmental awareness to our customers through our vast reach . INVESTING IN ENERGY-EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS AND SERVERS To reduce our carbon footprint and conserve energy , we focus on making pioneering changes to our infrastructure and buildings . We have been focusing on making our data centers more environmentally-friendly by switching to cooling and water- efficient systems supported by intelligent management technology and the use of renewable energy . Qiandao Lake Data Center The Qiandao Lake Data Center adopts a state-of-the-art deep lake water cooling system which saves 300 million kWh of electricity and reduces CO 2 emissions by 300,000 tons per year compared to other conventional data centers . The technology lowers its annual average Power Usage Effectiveness ( PUE ) to as low as 1.17 , considerably lower than many leading Chinese data center companies . The system also reduces the annual average Water Usage Efficiency ( WUE ) to reach 0.197 , which is also below China ’ s industry average.Zhangbei Data Center Located in Hebei province , in a naturally cool region with great access to wind power , the Zhangbei Data Center is powered 100 % by renewable energy including solar and wind . This increases the data center ’ s energy efficiency by more than 4 % while reducing construction and maintenance costs . The technology reduces the temperature of its servers , which keeps its average PUE at only 1.25 and reduces the energy consumption typically used for cooling by 59 % . Cooling system 300 M kWh of electricity saved by lake water cooling system per year 300 KTONS reduced CO2 emissions per yearRenewable energy 100 % powered by renewable energy 4 % increase in the data center ’ s energy efficiency per yearOne of the most visible environmental effects of technology companies is the power consumption of their hardware infrastructure . Because we have a substantial cloud computing service business , we are taking on the power consumption of other enterprises as well as our own . We employ energy-efficient technology and methods in our data centers , with a focus on minimizing our energy consumption . Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 45 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX Environment continued LIQUID IMMERSION COOLING TECHNOLOGY FOR ITS SERVERS Alibaba Group launched an immersion liquid cooling technology that further enhances the energy efficiency of its servers . Using non-conductive cryogenic liquid to achieve a cooling effect , this technology brings the PUE close to 1.0 . GREENING THE LOGISTICS SYSTEM Cainiao Network , our logistics business , is working towards a goal of replacing 50 % of all packaging materials on Alibaba- related platforms with 100 % eco-friendly or biodegradable packaging materials . We launched a “ green packaging ” program and pushed it to our courier service partners . Under the program , bio-degradable bags , tape-free boxes and package recycling bins are used . Using a packaging optimization algorithm , Cainiao Network matches packaging needs based on a parcel ’ s mass and volume , which on average reduces the use of packaging materials by approximately 15 % . This technology was applied in over 250 million delivery boxes and courier bags in the fiscal year ended March 2018 . We have also invested significant resources in green warehouses powered by solar panels , and using green energy vehicles . The effect of our initiatives is far-reaching for the China logistics industry , as the Alibaba China retail marketplace platforms generate a majority of all parcel deliveries annually . With Cainiao Network as the central information system and coordinator of our large logistics ecosystem , we are able to effectively implement our green philosophy and goals under our “ Green Logistics Alliance ” to 32 partner companies including courier service providers , warehouse operators and trucking firms . In addition , Cainiao Network teamed up with 500 global brands , including Kiehl ’ s , Wrigley Company , Mondelez International and Colgate-Palmolive , to establish the “ Green Brand Alliance ” that commits to using “ green packaging ” . We integrate green building features into our logistics parks by using energy-saving materials to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions . In 2016 , the energy savings rate of Alibaba ’ s logistics parks reached 10 % due to our optimization of energy use , our use of more energy-efficient equipment , and our promotion of paperless invoice and tracking systems.Cainiao Network is in the process of building green logistics parks powered by solar energy which will avoid more than 1 million tons of carbon emissions annually . Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 46 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX Case study Through the Alipay mobile payment app operated by our affiliate Ant Financial , users can collect “ green energy points ” through low-carbon options in their daily lives such as using e-payments instead of paper invoices and choosing public transportation , biking or walking instead of driving to reduce vehicle emissions . These “ green energy power points ” can be donated by users toward planting of trees in Northwest China . Users can track the progress real-time using their apps and share their progress via social media . Tapping into our digital platforms , we have created social games and features around the consciousness of carbon awareness for users , making tracking , sharing and contributing to a low-carbon lifestyle a part of people ’ s daily lives . As of May 2018 , 55 million trees have been planted on behalf of Ant Financial ’ s users while 350 million users participated . Ant Forest55 M Trees planted on behalf of Ant Financial ’ s users 350 M Users participatedEnvironment continued Alibaba Group Holding Limited ESG Report 2018 47 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE TRUST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX Concluding thoughts While we have regularly communicated our social impact strategy to domestic stakeholders in China , creating our first ESG report for the international investment community is an important milestone for our company . We will make periodic updates to our ESG strategy and activities in the future.In the process of creating this ESG report , we focused on the risks and opportunities that are most critical to our long-term sustainability as a business , and to our ambitions for the Alibaba Digital Economy . The process has deepened our resolve to keep corporate governance , IPR protection , cybersecurity , data protection , human capital , social contribution , and the environment top of our agenda . We know these issues are important to our stakeholders who not only judge us based on financial performance but also whether we are responsible actors in the global community . We hope that this ESG report has given you a fresh understanding of the integrated and comprehensive nature of ESG issues in our culture and business model . We are better prepared than ever for a dialogue about these issues . We welcome your feedback at BABAESG @ alibaba-inc.com .
